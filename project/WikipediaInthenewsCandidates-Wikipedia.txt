Please read the guidelines. Admin instructions are here. ??Skip to suggestions In the news toolbox Error reports Nominations (Archives) Discussion General criteria Death criteria Recurring items Admin guide Image protection Current events portal v t e Shortcut WP:ITN/C This page provides a forum for editors to suggest items for inclusion on In the news (ITN), a protected template on the Main Page, as well as the forum for discussion of candidates. This is not the page to report errors in the ITN section on the Main Page—please go to the appropriate section at WP:ERRORS. Archives of past nominations can be found here. This candidates page is integrated with the daily pages of Portal:Current events. Under each daily section header below is the transcluded Portal:Current events items for that day (with a light green header). Each day's portal page is followed by a subsection for suggestions and discussion. A blurb is a one sentence summary of the news story. An alternate suggestion for the blurb is called an altblurb, and any more suggestions get labelled alt1, alt2, etc. A blurb needs at least one target article, highlighted in bold; reviewers check the quality of that article and whether it is updated, and whether reliable sources demonstrate the significance of the event. Other articles can also be linked. The Ongoing line is for regularly updated articles which cover events that remain in the news over a longer period of time. RD stands for the "recent deaths" line, and can include any living thing whose death was recently announced. In some cases, recent deaths may need additional explanation as provided by a blurb; this is decided by consensus.

Find the correct section below for the date of the event (not the date nominated). Do not add sections for new dates. These are automatically generated (at midnight UTC) by a bot; creating them manually breaks this process. Nominate the blurb for ITN inclusion under the "Suggestions" subheading for the date, emboldening the link in the blurb to the updated article. Use a level 4 header (====) when doing so. Preferably use the template {{ITN candidate}} to nominate the article related to the event in the news. Make sure that you include a reference from a verifiable, reliable secondary source. Press releases are not acceptable. The suggested blurb should be written in simple present tense. Adding an explanation why the event should be posted greatly increases the odds of posting. Please consider alerting editors to the nomination by adding the template {{ITN note}} to the corresponding article's talk page. Purge this page to update the cache There are criteria which guide the decision on whether or not to put a particular item on In the news, based largely on the extensiveness of the updated content and the perceived significance of the recent developments. These are listed at WP:ITN. Submissions that do not follow the guidelines at Wikipedia:In the news will not be placed onto the live template. Headers[edit] Items that have been posted or pulled from the main page are generally marked with (Posted) or (Pulled) in the item's subject so it is clear they are no longer active. Items can also be marked as (Ready) when the article is both updated and there seems to be a consensus to post. The posting admin, however, should always judge the update and the consensus to post themselves. If you find an entry that you don't feel is ready to post is marked (Ready), you should remove the mark in the header. Voicing an opinion on an item[edit] Format your comment to contain "support" or "oppose", and include a rationale for your choice. In particular, address the notability of the event, the quality of the article, and whether it has been updated. Please do not...[edit] add simple "support!" or "oppose!" votes without including your reasons. Similarly, curt replies such as "who?", "meh", or "duh!" are usually not helpful. Instead, explain the reasons why you think the item meets or does not meet the ITN inclusion criteria so a consensus can be reached. oppose an item because the event is only relating to a single country, or failing to relate to one. This applies to a high percentage of the content we post and is unproductive. accuse other editors of supporting, opposing or nominating due to a personal bias (such as ethnocentrism). Conflicts of interest are not handled at ITN. comment on a story without first reading the relevant article(s). oppose a recurring item here because you disagree with the recurring items criteria. The criteria can be discussed at the relevant talk page.

The assassination itself, of course, would have been ITN-worthy, as would the convictions of the accused. To me, this is on the same level. BD2412 T 21:30, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Just remembered it won't make DYK as much of the content was copy/pasted from the main article, and it's not 5x from that. ITN it is! – Muboshgu (talk) 21:36, 17 November 2021 (UTC) It was also created nine months ago so any expansion at that time is far too old; you could conceivably get it through DYK if it passes as a Good Article though. ??????? ? 21:43, 17 November 2021 (UTC) It was just moved to mainspace. – Muboshgu (talk) 23:34, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Not only would this by DYK material, it's not even eligible per Muboshgu.

The two who are being exonerated are not independently notable and were released decades ago, so the actual impact is minimal. Modest Genius talk 13:13, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Support This is receiving a fair amount of coverage (main headline in the NYT and Daily News) and it looks like a decent article, just one cite tag that I can see.-- Pawnkingthree (talk) 13:57, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose While likely an important move for proper justice, not really that significant in the long run. --Masem (t) 14:03, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Support. If it was found that John Wilkes Booth did not assassinate Lincoln, or that Lee Harvey Oswald did not assassinate JFK, it would be posted, and I don't see how this is different. The history books are not often changed in such a manner. 331dot (talk) 14:35, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Those two examples were incomparably more significant, as both victims were heads of state. – Sca (talk) 15:24, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Malcolm X was not a head of state but he was highly influential in the cause of civil rights. The point is that history is not often corrected as it was here. 331dot (talk) 16:53, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – per Modest Genius.

Joseph2302 (talk) 20:40, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: Perhaps the blurb can mention the evacuation of thousands of residents and the destruction of infrastructure. Power outage and a small death toll won't cut it. --PFHLai (talk) 22:35, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Comment - this is quite a significant event in Canada, with reports that it could become the most expensive natural disaster in Canadian history [4], the death toll is expected to rise, along with wide ranging effects on supply chains and transportation networks. If I recall correctly, I think we did post the 2013 Alberta floods, for precedent. Connormah (talk) 22:39, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I guess "could be" is key here. If it does become the most expensive natural disaster after electing Trudeau in the history of Canada, then it's well placed for a blurb. Maybe now is premature. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:42, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Wait Living through this, it's a pretty devastating disaster, with all road access cut off to and from the Port of Vancouver, which is having a major impact on supply chains across Western Canada. But I don't think this meets the standard previously set for ITN just yet, although there are reports that the death toll is expected to rise. There's also reports of an imminent dike breach into a large city. As such, I'd suggest that we wait. NorthernFalcon (talk) 22:51, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – Lots of damage & dislocation but so far only one fatal. – Sca (talk) 23:29, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Wait If this gets worse and deadlier, then I will support.

(Post) Alternative blurb: ?Russia shoots down Kosmos 1408 with an anti-satellite weapon, creating a field of space debris. Alternative blurb II: ?Kosmos 1408 is destroyed by a Russian anti-satellite weapon and turned into a stream of space debris. News source(s): BBC, AP, Reuters, Guardian, Bloomberg Credits: Nominated by Andrew Davidson (talk · give credit) Created by Mike Peel (talk · give credit) Updated by Smeagol 17 (talk · give credit) Article updated Nominator's comments: We have some real news about the ISS now as the crew have to take shelter from a shower of debris created by a Russian missile test. And the Kessler syndrome advances another notch. What we're mainly missing is a good picture but we might use something generic like this. Andrew?(talk) 12:56, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support in principle, as this is a significant event for the space industry (more so than Crew-3 that we already have on the template). However the article is pretty lightweight and could use some expansion. It also needs a source for the claim that Russia was responsible for the test - we can't claim something in the blurb that isn't cited in the article. I would also remove 'dangerous' from the blurb as that's quite a strong accusation. Modest Genius talk 13:05, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Article seems fine now, though as I was one of the users updating it an independent assessment would be welcome. Modest Genius talk 18:16, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support on the merits; the use of an anti-satellite weapon(even as a test) is rare and few countries possess such technology. Russia isn't denying it. 331dot (talk) 13:10, 16 November 2021 (UTC) @331dot: Yes, the use is rare and few countries possess such technology. Yet, I remember a similar test from India a couple of years ago was rejected as the technology "has been around for a while." If I recall correctly, there had been significant debate about debris back then too. 2405:201:4013:8087:A828:E291:B9B5:4B09 (talk) 18:31, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I can only comment on the nomination in front of me; I can't speak to past ones at this time. 331dot (talk) 19:15, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support in principle though article needs to include that Russia shot it down (right now, the article just says it broke up). And other cn tags in article would need fixing. Though I agree, this is way more important/notable/covered in news sources than Crew-3. Joseph2302 (talk) 13:12, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Comment I started putting this through DYK earlier today, see Template:Did you know nominations/Kosmos 1408, since I haven't enjoyed participating in previous ITN discussions. But if you want this here, then the DYK can be withdrawn. I've updated the template above, since I started the article yesterday. Thanks. Mike Peel (talk) 13:14, 16 November 2021 (UTC) One option would be to merge this into the existing Crew-3 ISS mission blurb. If Kosmos 1408 is not bolded then it can still be a DYK too. Andrew?(talk) 13:22, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I oppose merging those blurbs - these are separate events. Modest Genius talk 14:07, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I also oppose merging- they're separate events, and this one is more important, so shouldn't be stuck on the end of some less important and newswirthy article that's only on the front page because it was alledgedly ITNR (even though that ITNR criteria was demonstrated to be unfit for purpose). And if this does reach front page, then DYK would no longer be eligible, but until that point, don't see a need to withdraw the DYK nom. Joseph2302 (talk) 14:30, 16 November 2021 (UTC) We could remove the Crew-3 blurb and replace it with this one when this is ready to go (assuming Crew-3 is still on ITN). Yeah, it doesn't get its "full time" there, but I agree that it doesn't make sense to merge, but having two ISS-related things could be seen as overwhelming the box. --Masem (t) 14:35, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – Fairly widely covered, but broader significance of a "threat" to the ISS isn't so apparent. – Sca (talk) 13:38, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Even a fleck of paint could seriously damage the ISS, one of the most expensive objects ever constructed. 331dot (talk) 11:14, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support in principle. This is very significant news and an interesting story of high encyclopedic value.--Kiril Simeonovski (talk) 13:41, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support in principle per above, just needs better fleshing out of the article. --Masem (t) 13:53, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – Upon reflection, it seems to be a serious threat all right, but ... can we post something that hasn't had a tangible effect ... yet? – Sca (talk) 14:11, 16 November 2021 (UTC) PS: My question is, did Putin authorize this stupid 'test' – or was it just an act of heedless military apparatchiks down in the bureaucracy? (Russia is an oligarchy that has a country – a country that has an enormous military.) – Sca (talk) 14:19, 16 November 2021 (UTC) The way I'm reading it, the story is more that Russia has appeared to have violated a treaty related to space-bound weapons, in addition to this being a story of interest to space exploration (the potential of damage to the ISS that forced the crew to shelter for at least two orbits as it passed through the debris field). --Masem (t) 14:17, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Reasonable enough. However, the threat to human lives (including two Russians!) seems more compelling in terms of reader interest. – Sca (talk) 14:22, 16 November 2021 (UTC) From our article on the Outer Space Treaty: "Although it forbids establishing military bases, testing weapons and conducting military maneuvers on celestial bodies, the treaty does not expressly ban all military activities in space, nor the establishment of military space forces or the placement of conventional weapons in space". Testing an anti-satellite weapon on your own target is not against any treaty, just regarded as irresponsible. Note that the US, China and India have all conducted similar tests with no legal repercussions or UN censure. Modest Genius talk 15:09, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose no longer fresh, not really in the news, rolled off a while ago and probably better suited for DYK. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 16:11, 16 November 2021 (UTC) What's your time frame for "no longer fresh"? The BBC article is only 12 hours old and the event itself occurred yesterday. It's certainly a newer event than anything currently in the ITN box... --Jayron32 16:16, 16 November 2021 (UTC) (edit conflict) The BBC published two more articles about this story in just the last hour [5] [6]. That seems pretty fresh. Modest Genius talk 16:19, 16 November 2021 (UTC) It happened yesterday, and is very much still in the news. Much more so than the posted blurbs, such as the NYC Marathon on 7 November for example. Joseph2302 (talk) 16:20, 16 November 2021 (UTC) OH sure, you can dig into websites and find more analysis, but it's not headline news and hasn't been for most of the day now. Even the article makes it clear that the "main event" has passed. Biggest headlines in the UK are now that Johnson is proposing to prevent MPs from getting paid consultancy jobs. This story is no longer even on the BBC News homepage. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 16:24, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support Article is short, but sufficient; it seems to have developed some since the earlier notes. Topic is being covered by reliable news sources. --Jayron32 16:17, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose ... for now. Article text comprises 340 words, of which 115 are background, leaving a mere 230 words about the current threat. IMO, too thin for MP promotion. Second, we shouldn't blurb something that hasn't had an impact (yet). – Sca (talk) 17:03, 16 November 2021 (UTC) PS: Given that the current situation could continue for quite some time, perhaps after a bit we should consider posting this directly to Ongoing. – Sca (talk) 17:10, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Whatever political fallout there has been is pretty much so far just a short but important burst (for blurb posting), but there's no sign this is going to escalate into something further, in comparison to the nuclear submarine sale a few months back. --Masem (t) 19:50, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Wait is there a real danger debris hits other satellites soon, or is this just "an abundance of caution"? Will there be significant geo-political ramifications from the test? Until one of those is "yes", I think we should wait. User:? (powera, ?, ?) 19:52, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Everywhere is at risk for disaster, but this info is nothing like disaster actually happening. Political story, and involving two countries who always bicker. Could change if the ISS is destroyed or something stronger than words breaks out. InedibleHulk (talk) 20:46, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Is this an RD nom for the destruction of Kosmos 1408? If so, its "career section" needs an expansion to describe how it was used while still in orbit and operational.--PFHLai (talk) 23:08, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Questionable significance as far as potential impacts, especially given at the moment it is just predictive. I would assume that the test itself is not sufficient for ITN, so I'm on the "Oppose" side here. DarkSide830 (talk) 00:01, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support even if nothing happens to the ISS, ASAT weapon tests don't happen every day, or even every year. Banedon (talk) 03:44, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support Certainly magnitudes more important than the multitude of launches posted every now and then on ITN. Gotitbro (talk) 07:09, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support significant, made the news and the article Kosmos 1408 is short but adequate. Given the military nature of this satellite and its destruction, we can't expect to know that many details. Of the proposed blurbs, only alt 1 is good. --LukeSurl t c 10:02, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support in principle this is a significant story BUT it simply cannot be posted with a blurb of this quality. Its language is misleading and makes it sound as if a functional satellite was attacked, but rather a defunct satellite was destroyed as part of a weapons test... slightly different. Possibly also include the name of the missile system, if known, and replace "Russia" with the actual agency overseeing the test. JMonkey2006 (talk) 11:10, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Feel free to propose a different blurb. Or we could simply add 'defunct' before the name of the satellite. Modest Genius talk 11:38, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – Absent from main RS sites on Wednesday; no longer in the news. Seems a minor issue without tangible effects. Neither target article is really about this event. – Sca (talk) 12:42, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support in principle per JMonkey. Fakescientist8000 (talk) 13:54, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support. The Kessler syndrome may have been triggered: "The Kessler syndrome is troublesome because of the domino effect and feedback runaway wherein impacts between objects of sizable mass spall off debris from the force of the collision. The fragments can then hit other objects, producing even more space debris: if a large enough collision or explosion were to occur, such as between a space station and a defunct satellite, or as the result of hostile actions in space, then the resulting debris cascade could make prospects for long-term viability of satellites in particular low Earth orbits extremely low." Count Iblis (talk) 14:52, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support - Russia is weaponizing space. Whether or not they were the first to do it - and presumably they weren't - this is an indication of a change in global affairs when it comes to outer space.--WaltCip-(talk) 16:16, 17 November 2021 (UTC) If you didn't know (see anti-satellite weapon), the first ASAT test was in 1959, and was conducted by the US. Banedon (talk) 02:06, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Comment any admins around here to post this? I oppose its inclusion as it's already stale in my opinion, but there's a pretty clear consensus here and the longer it's left unposted, the staler it becomes....

The coalition has two leaders, not just Petkov. Do we want to wait till a government is formed? --PFHLai (talk) 12:01, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I guess yeah, he deserves one too, but Petkov is the primary focus here as he is the one seeking to become prime minister (per https://www.euronews.com/2021/11/14/bulgarian-elections-newly-formed-pp-party-neck-and-neck-with-right-wing-gerb-party). The truth is we don't even know yet if they will be successful forming a goverment, but we posted both the Czech party SPOLU and the last Bulgarian election when ITN won the most seats as the election itself is ITNR, so going by that this nomination/blurb should be suitable to make it out to the front page.BastianMAT (talk) 12:17, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support Article is in great shape. I think the easiest way to solve what PFHLai exposes is to put in the blurb that Petkov is the "co-leader", thus making it understood that he is not the only one leading the coalition. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 12:42, 16 November 2021 (UTC) How about not mentioning either co-leaders in the blurb?

Remember, go for it!. Fakescientist8000 (talk) 15:19, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Comment I wanted to nominate this but hasitated. Are these midterms considered general elections? Half of the seats in the lower chamber and 1/3 of the upper chamber are up for election and our article defines general elections as "elections in which all or most members of a political body are chosen." Scaramouche33 (talk) 16:16, 15 November 2021 (UTC) I half-wondered if such "mid-term" elections were covered by ITNR. If they are, perhaps that should also be explicitly noted at ITNR. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 16:19, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Yeah, mid terms elections are part of it, it is notable too as the ruling party have lost their majority. Here is the US one that was also posted. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:In_the_news/Candidates/November_2018#(Posted)_2018_US_Midterm_Elections.BastianMAT (talk) 16:28, 15 November 2021 (UTC) But that was mainly because it involved "all or most members of a political body are chosen". This doesn't appear to be the case here. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 16:44, 15 November 2021 (UTC) It depends on how you see on it. The mid term senate elections in US only feature 34 members up running for election. In Argentina it was half of the congress and enough for an significant change in both political bodies (ruling party losing control of both the house and the senate).BastianMAT (talk) 16:53, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Well it doesn't matter what happened in the US, how does this meet the requirements at ITNR? The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 16:59, 15 November 2021 (UTC) From what I understand, in the US midterms all House seats+1/3 of Senate seats were up for election so that would be considered as "most members of an electoral body" but here it's only half. Does that still count as general elections? If so it's ITN/R, if not who knows. Scaramouche33 (talk) 17:14, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Yeah I agree, it is arguable for both sides. At least based on this, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midterm_election, Argentina[1] (legislative and local election) falls under the heading General elections (which makes it ITNR) alongside the United States (legislative and local election) which was posted.BastianMAT (talk) 17:17, 15 November 2021 (UTC) I'm not sure it is arguable here, it doesn't meet the definition in ITNR and it's a mid-term, not a general election by any normal definition (despite what "Wikipedia" might say). The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 17:30, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – First four grafs back into the results and seem needlessly complex. – Sca (talk) 17:19, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Comment the table in the infobox violates MOS:COLHEAD by having column headers in the middle of the table.

I believe it's the first bombing in England since 2017 Manchester Arena one, and caused the UK terror threat level to be increased. Article itself is good enough quality. Joseph2302 (talk) 17:23, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support given that they have assigned terrorist motives to this now.

The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 18:04, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose This was a minor terrorist attack that caused only one casualty. Now we are not concerned about the number of victims? Certainly "is in the news", but I don't think it has the same relevance as other terrorist incidents that have occurred that have not been approved to be on Main Page. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 18:33, 16 November 2021 (UTC) The perpetrator was killed and the taxi driver was hospitalised. Martinevans123 (talk) 18:40, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. Failed attack which caused one injury and killed the attacker. It's not clear what the target was or who it was supposed to terrorise. If this hadn't been declared a terrorist incident it would be minor local news. I encourage the existing DYK nom instead. Modest Genius talk 19:02, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Regardless of terrorism tag, I suspect this would have been national news. But of course, we will never know. The fact is it is big national news. Martinevans123 (talk) 19:07, 16 November 2021 (UTC) But it was declared a terrorist attack, which adds notability to the incident. Jbvann05 20:32, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Not really, it just grants the police additional powers and generates more headlines. The actual event doesn't become any worse. Modest Genius talk 13:18, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Support alt Notable, now declared a terrorist incident, article in decent shape.  Spy-cicle?  Talk? 19:15, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support - Terrorism need not have a high death count in order to be notable and newsworthy; we have posted terrorist incidents on ITN that have had a death toll of zero.--WaltCip-(talk) 20:04, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Comment I find it very interesting how many of those who support this nomination refused to publish the terrorist attack in Auckland in September, whose consequences were almost the same as in this case.

Martinevans123 (talk) 21:05, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you for your answer because clearly I've realized that I have not expressed myself well. I mean that at the time, the reason why I've opposed was the same used by other users (who have not participated in this debate, except Modest Genius) to not support the cited nomination in September. That is why I am frankly surprised. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 21:29, 16 November 2021 (UTC) BLP Caution One suspect is dead, but four others are arrested in connection; might want to attribute this "attempted terrorist bombing" instead of stating it as a fact Wikipedia knows (a "declaration" from police is still an allegation).

Can't go wrong speaking ill of the dead. At least by Wikipedian norms. InedibleHulk (talk) 22:10, 16 November 2021 (UTC) No need to get personal, if you don't mind. Norman Butkiss 123 (talk) 22:47, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. I will admit to perhaps being more jaded to bomb stories than some other nationalities may be, but even with that notwithstanding, I don't believe we'd be considering an attack which killed no victims and injured one if it took place elsewhere (we recently didn't post, for example, an attack that targeted but didn't kill a head of state). That isn't necessarily to say there's any deliberate bias here but it's important to remember that England has a well-developed media sphere and any regional story will have a lot of domestic coverage, but we are not necessarily beholden to repeat their biases. For reference, even the BBC have displaced this story in favour of the latest update in a racism dispute in county cricket. ??????? ? 21:46, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support major incident, leading news story, article decent. Polyamorph (talk) 21:48, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support (Alt 2). UK terror threat level raised from substantial to severe pushes it over the edge. Martinevans123 (talk) 23:15, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose As suicide in Britain goes, it was unusually public and explosive, but lacks too much death and destruction next to the general public suicide bombings (a similar story from Strathroy-Caradoc#History isn't even an article, for context). InedibleHulk (talk) 23:19, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose -- it's already stopped being news, it seems. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 02:50, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Questionable significance since nothing major [fortunately] did not take place. Gotitbro (talk) 07:12, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose as the investigation has not been completed and it has not been confirmed yet whether it was terrorism, whether the detonation was intentional or accidental, or who the intended victim or victims might to have been. The current article contains too much opinion, innuendo, and speculation portrayed as fact. -- DeFacto (talk). 07:38, 17 November 2021 (UTC) By all means mark any "opinion, innuendo, and speculation portrayed as fact" and/or take to the talk page. Opinion is generally permitted if it's clearly attributed? Thanks. Martinevans123 (talk) 11:21, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Very Strong Oppose Per WP:Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, we are supposed to be an encyclopedia, and we are NOT supposed to be a dangerous free publicity machine for every murderous suicidal nutter, still less for every would-be terrorist and every terrorist organisation. So a terrorist incident should be truly exceptional and notable before appearing on our front page, all the more so as it is often liable to remain there giving dangerous free publicity (and thus in practice encouragement) to terrorists and other murderous nutters long after it has disappeared from the front pages of other mainstream Western news outlets (as many terrorists probably already realize, even if many editors around here seemingly don't). There is NOTHING in this incident that gives it the required exceptionality and notability to justify the danger this poses to innocent people, as well as the damage it might (rightly in my view) do to our reputation. Tlhslobus (talk) 18:15, 17 November 2021 (UTC) See WP:RIGHTGREATWRONGS. Your diatribe is interesting, but nothing to do with ITNC, otherwise we'd never publish another mass shooting in the US ever again. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 18:27, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose No lasting effect plus terrible disjointed article means it's a No from me, Bob. Black Kite (talk) 18:23, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose The story stopped trending yesterday, and the death/injury toll is very low (luckily). If attacks of this kind were rare in the UK I would be willing to overlook these factors, but (unfortunately) there's been a seemingly-steady uptick in the last couple of years, so there's nothing about this that makes it stand out. Mount Patagonia (talk) 18:27, 17 November 2021 (UTC) But the satellite blow-up stopped trending 36 hours ago and no-one died. Terror attacks where bombs are ignited on Remembrance Day are few and far between, I'm sure you can point me to the last time that happened, right? The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 18:29, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I was referencing upticks in UK-based terror attacks in general, not ones falling on Rememberance Day. If terror attacks that fell on special occasions were automatic shoe-ins, then last year's Christmas bombing in Nashville would have been posted, but it wasn't for the same reasons I'm opposing posting this story. For the Russian satellite, take it up with the people for voted for it because I had no involvement in that decision. Mount Patagonia (talk) 22:06, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Indeed, terror attacks often happen on supposedly significant days or dates (sometimes perhaps coincidentally, sometimes perhaps as part of an attempt to increase the attack's psychological impact, or perhaps sometimes for quasi-religious reasons). Not only do we not use this as an excuse to put it into ITN, we sometimes leave it out of the article as well. For instance it was 5 years before Wikipedia mentioned that the Bataclan attacks occurred on Friday the 13th and there is still no link from it to the article about the superstition, presumably because RS don't mention such a link (perhaps to avoid making vulnerable people more fearful or otherwise psychologically distressed or harmed whenever 'significant' dates approach). Tlhslobus (talk) 15:33, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Comment we don't need to name the perp in any of the blurbs. That's totally undue. Get a grip people. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 18:30, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I've been bold and removed the name of the perp. We don't need that, even if this isn't posted, anywhere near this encyclopedia. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 20:17, 17 November 2021 (UTC) The name of the perpetrator is encyclopedic and should be in the article; but I agree that it should not be posted in ITN regardless. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 00:14, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose No victims and unclear / unorganised motive. Belugsump (talk) 03:44, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – Limited significance. No longer in the news. – Sca (talk) 13:06, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose.

Joseph2302 (talk) 14:36, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Agree. It's also not compliant with MOS:ACCESS since it contains nested tables. This should be fixed before it's posted on the main page.  — Amakuru (talk) 17:17, 15 November 2021 (UTC) MOS:DTAB is a laudable goal, but not one of the WP:ITNCRIT. It's probably moot though, as no improvements to the article have been made in the last 3 days. Modest Genius talk 11:36, 17 November 2021 (UTC) While articles on topics such as sporting events and economics lend themselves to tables of numbers, updates must be at least in part written in prose to qualify for ITN consideration. That isn't the case here, as the section in question is using ugly nested tables rather than prose (like I suggested doing days ago).

Some activists are critical of the agreement, as it leaves unresolved the question of how much and how quickly each nation should cut its carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions over the next decade, and it still leaves many developing countries short of the funds that they would need in order to cope with increasing weather disasters.

Once this is updated, I will probably support on importance. User:? (powera, ?, ?) 02:52, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose there's at least enough article to vote. Article still has issues; the "Pledges" section is describing things agreed at the conference that don't appear to be specifically part of the "Glasgow Climate Pact", and the link to Wikisource isn't broken. As far as importance ... we posted the conference once, and the biggest news is that there are plans to decrease coal usage ... this isn't worth posting again. User:? (powera, ?, ?) 01:06, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Support – in principle ... pending updating and succinct revision of 2021 climate conference article. It would be very odd not to blurb this universally covered confab, now over. – Sca (talk) 13:44, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Comment That we already posted the COP26 earlier, and that the general impression of the Glasgow Pact that I get from sources is that it is far less as a milestone compared to the Paris Agreements (since it basically affirms commitment to them) makes me wonder if this is really that significant to post a second time. --Masem (t) 14:23, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Au contraire. Despite disappointments, 'world leaders' said to "broadly welcome" the climate deal, which "for the first time targeted fossil fuels." At least they did something. Prominently covered by every major RS site. – Sca (talk) 15:28, 14 November 2021 (UTC) That sentence wasn't over. First time targeting fossil fuels "as the key driver of global warming". Whatever that means. InedibleHulk (talk) 16:29, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Resistance is futile. "In asking nations to set tougher targets by next year for cutting climate-warming emissions, the agreement effectively acknowledged that commitments were still inadequate. National pledges currently have the world on track for about 2.4C of warming." The article quality outlook is also dire. InedibleHulk (talk) 16:38, 14 November 2021 (UTC) We're not here to judge the work of the conferees. We're here to take note a very heavily covered, extended international conference that was widely and prominently covered. Do I think the so-called climate pact will solve global warming? No (although it might be a move in the right direction). What you or I think of it doesn't matter. What matters is, it was/is very much in the news, and the topic is hugely significant. – Sca (talk) 17:32, 14 November 2021 (UTC) The work of the conferees is the topic. If the news reports the commitments made therein as inadequate, it's not hugely significant in the broader and more newsworthy topic area of global warming prevention. This running conference is just in the news because it was long expected to end today somehow. InedibleHulk (talk) 17:45, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Nope. Even if they had done nothing it would be significant for reasons outlined above. – Sca (talk) 17:49, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I respectfully disagree. InedibleHulk (talk) 17:54, 14 November 2021 (UTC) If we hadn't posted the COP26 thing earlier, I would have been fine with posting this as an ending point as generally the overall conference was in the news. But given that we already did and this new piece is not a major piece of environmental commitment compared to the Paris Agreement, double posting this is just not appropriate. --Masem (t) 22:25, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose article is short and unsourced in places. Also, given the Paris Agreement exists, it seems the impact of this is minimal (limited only to reducing coal). Joseph2302 (talk) 09:00, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Support on the merits; it's unusual for 197 countries to agree to any single document, even if largely a statement of principles or desires. But agree it is not yet suitable for posting. 331dot (talk) 10:02, 15 November 2021 (UTC) It should be pointed out that not all 190-some signing countries are committed to the same parts of the document: for example, only 40+ are on board with coal reduction. Hence why this is far less impactful as the Paris Agreements. --Masem (t) 13:41, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Support original blurb in principle, oppose on quality. The pact is a bit of a damp squib, far less ambitious than expected or required. However we're not here to judge the outcome, just whether it meets the ITN criteria. This is certainly in the news, at or near the top of every quality media outlet. However the pact article is barely a start class and needs some major TLC before being postable. I considered bolding the COP26 article again, but its 'outcomes' section is in even worse state.

The article is not good enough for front page quality (as ITN isn't OTD, which likes to post poorly sourced articles), and there's no consensus to post it anyway, as they don't seem to have all agreed anything (as different countries signed different agreements).

I, along with others, consistently oppose attempts to post stories in Ongoing without giving them a blurb first, because most of the time it's lazy, unnecessary and does a disservice to readers who deserve to be told the reason why a story's important. I made an exception here because it's a rare occasion where there's a big constantly-updated story that doesn't really have one catch-all blurb available. Most of the time we should be blurbing before we put things into Ongoing, that's just common sense given that the stories are big enough to make the news.  — Amakuru (talk) 15:59, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Exactly who are these "others"? And if you think that's the correct thing to do, you and your others could just discuss this to the talk page in order to stop the unnecessary ranting every time someone attempted to get a topic straight to Ongoing. As some users have pointed out (? above, 331dot, and Indefensible), what you say isn't written anywhere, so it could confuse people. Have a great day. --180.244.175.150 (talk) 16:11, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Amakuru The way the guidelines are written would seem to suggest that the opposite of your position is true( Any story may be proposed for an "ongoing" link through the normal use of the nomination page. Generally, these are stories which may lack a blurb-worthy event, but which nonetheless are still getting regular updates to the relevant article. ). If people want to know why something is important, they will read the article. If you would like to work to amend the guidelines to require a blurb first, please start such a discussion. 331dot (talk) 16:22, 13 November 2021 (UTC) @331dot: you know as well as I do that the guidelines are mostly ignored in ITN discussions, in favour of precedent and unwritten custom. According to our "purpose", we are supposed to "help readers find and quickly access content they are likely to be searching for because an item is in the news" - something we blatantly don't do, because instead we evaluate the significance of everything at ITN/C, under the mantra that we're "not a newsticker". I used to argue the opposite, but at some point you accept the status quo. The same goes here. While the guidelines may suggest that something can go straight to Ongoing, in practice that rarely happens. We blurb stories first and then drop it to Ongoing later, that's simply the way it's always worked. It'd be fantastic if we had a set of proper guidelines that we could follow in all cases, but it would need a bit change in the way the discussions on this page work.  — Amakuru (talk) 19:14, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Throughout my history here I have always worked for the posting of items that I think are in the news and likely to be searched for. This is not 331dot's In The News, it is a community project, and I accept the consensus of what happens here(that's not a criticism of you, but a statement about me.) I do not claim that blurb-ongoing doesn't or shouldn't happen, only that the guidelines do not preclude (and actually encourage) straight-to-Ongoing posting. I would support clarifying that both are possible if there is consensus to do so. 331dot (talk) 19:22, 13 November 2021 (UTC) I agree that most (but not all) of the time, stories should be blurbs before ongoing. If we need to discuss more, perhaps this should move to the talk page. User:? (powera, ?, ?) 19:41, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Posted  — Amakuru (talk) 23:38, 12 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose There are many similar migrant/refugee issues elsewhere. For example, Record high migrant detentions at US-Mexico border; Record number of people cross Channel to UK in small boats; Ocean Viking: Nine-day standoff ends as migrant ship allowed to dock in Sicily; Iran deporting thousands of Afghan refugees. These seem endemic as there's a continuous pressure to move from poor and failed states to more stable and successful ones. It's not clear why this particular border should get attention and how it will stop being an ongoing issue. Andrew?(talk) 14:40, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Are you arguing that this is not receiving news coverage right now?(a genuine question) This is an example of refugees being used as a weapon, as the Belarus dictator has openly said he would do. There does not need to be a clear end date for something in order to post it to Ongoing; its removal can be proposed if it drops out of the news. If you feel other such events should be posted, please nominate them, we can only consider what is nominated. 331dot (talk) 14:47, 13 November 2021 (UTC) All of these hotspots are in the news both now and as ongoing for years. To single one out for special attention, there needs to be some special incident and that is best done as a blurb. As an ongoing entry, the linked article should be something more general such as European migrant crisis or List of largest refugee crises. Note that the latter has four entries which extend to the present day. Andrew?(talk) 21:32, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Weak oppose ongoing, support blurb This seems to be a recent escalation for an ongoing border issue, for which a blurb makes sense IMO. If it's still ongoing by the time it rolls off the template, then it would be fine for ongoing. I know a blurb isn't a specific requirement for items to be added to the ongoing section, but given the inertia common to the ongoing section and the vague timelines that accompany these items (the majority of the time they are removed following lack of regular update for 1-2 weeks), I think encouraging blurbs with roll-over to ongoing should be preferred, and for this item I think makes a lot of sense. SpencerT•C 19:15, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Then I suggest you make a suggestion for a blurb.

I think mentioning apartheid is more beneficial to readers than just the appearance/race. 331dot (talk) 13:15, 11 November 2021 (UTC) Most RS coverage refers to him as the last white president.

(Support modified as I've now added Altblurb2, detailed explanation to follow below shortly) I was about to propose an altblurb myself before the current altblurb got suggested, and before the blurb got posted, but ran into edit conflict twice, and I see the proposed altblurb is probably a lot more concise than I could have managed. Our blurb should say as concisely as possible something like that he negotiated the end of apartheid with Mandela (concision may or may not require omitting explicit mention of Mandela, as in the current altblurb). After all, that's why he's really notable and worth a blurb. And if we don't say it explicitly (and our posted blurb doesn't) it arguably makes us look a bit racist to the uninformed, on the basis of 'Why would an Apartheid President deserve a blurb?'. I may or may not try to add one or more other altblurbs shortly, simply to mention Mandela, but I suspect other editors may do a better (more concise) job there than me, as I'm usually not very good at concision. Tlhslobus (talk) 13:28, 11 November 2021 (UTC) But we're impressed with your use of the word "concision." – Sca (talk) 13:39, 11 November 2021 (UTC)  ;-) And presumably you're even more impressed with the lack of concision in my use of the word "concision." – Tlhslobus (talk) 13:49, 11 November 2021 (UTC) Well, appropriately, it was your last word (the 175th). – Sca (talk) 14:01, 11 November 2021 (UTC) Not disagreeing on a stronger altblurb, but I would suggest stronger language as he not only backed the end, but (from our article) seemed to actively support steps in dismantling apartheid and making South Africa democratic (obviously he didn't do it alone). Just saying he backed the end seems to be an undercut statement to that point. --Masem (t) 13:37, 11 November 2021 (UTC) I used "backed" as a slightly shorter version of "supported" (ex-jnlst that I am). – Sca (talk) 13:43, 11 November 2021 (UTC) I've now added altblurb2, and amended my support to support it as my preferred altblurb, tho altblurb1 is also OK by me. The advantages of altblurb2 (compared to altblurb1) is that it avoids mentioning 'white', avoids saying 'apartheid' twice, mentions Mandela, and is stronger and more precise than merely 'backed', while still being only slightly longer than altblurb1. (I've already mentioned above the advantages of either altblurb compared to our current posted blurb). Tlhslobus (talk) 14:16, 11 November 2021 (UTC) (Altblurb2 just got a little longer as I've added '(pictured)' to show its expected true length).Tlhslobus (talk) 14:25, 11 November 2021 (UTC) I've deitalicized the situation somewhat. InedibleHulk (talk) 16:56, 11 November 2021 (UTC) Support altb-2 Better and more holistic than the current blurb, simply stating apartheid doesn't cut it for the average reader. Gotitbro (talk) 21:14, 11 November 2021 (UTC) Comment Let us not forget that we should not put the blurbs so long if it's not an essential requirement (in this case we would go up to, possibly, six lines in Main Page). In the same way that we should not forget that in most cases we do not specify so much the reason why that person is remarkable. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 21:36, 11 November 2021 (UTC) Consensus for Alt2 has emerged, blurb updated. Stephen 00:48, 12 November 2021 (UTC) Post-posting blurb support I support the current blurb posted. Is there a way to include his Nobel Prize win. --TDKR Chicago 101 (talk) 05:08, 12 November 2021 (UTC) It can be done in several ways. Shortest is perhaps "Nobel-Prize-winning former ...". Alternatively "..., who shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Nelson Mandela for ending apartheid, ...". But I'm neutral on whether it would be a good idea, for several reasons. On the plus side it's fairly important info. On the minus side, it lengthens the blurb. And I had to omit the date to avoid confusion (the prize was 1993, apartheid ended in 1994). And some might argue that it's unnecessary/unbalanced gilding of the lily, and some might want to balance it with a word such as "controversial" (because of his actual or alleged role/responsibility in some of the worst crimes of apartheid, a seemingly still ongoing debate in today's South Africa). Personally I prefer not to risk getting further involved in such an argument.

Andrew?(talk) 15:18, 11 November 2021 (UTC) I mean, this one actually went into space space. ??????? ? 15:28, 11 November 2021 (UTC) This wasn't exactly going boldly as the ISS is only 250 miles up – I drove further than that myself yesterday. The main point that the NYT article makes is that this is now over 600 people in space (and they include the Shatner launch in this too). At some point this is routine, rather than special news. Shatner got attention on account of his remarkable age and his celebrity but this launch doesn't have so much going for it. Andrew?(talk) 16:05, 11 November 2021 (UTC) Correct me if I'm wrong, but as far as I know, only crewed missions that go into orbit are considered ITN/R whereas the Blue Origin mission was suborbital. Scaramouche33 (talk) 16:10, 11 November 2021 (UTC) It's ITNR so this opposition can be overlooked. We're here to assess the quality of the article only. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 16:12, 11 November 2021 (UTC) ITNR items do allow to discuss if the specific instance may not be as notable as other elements in broad category (via IAR), though we should not be using ITNC to argue about inclusion of the broad category. (To that end, I have opened a thread at WT:ITN related to removing this ITNR item) --Masem (t) 17:51, 11 November 2021 (UTC) Comment although space flights are listed on ITN/R, there no actual link to a discussion on there (whereas almost every other ITN/R item has actually had a discussion). Did people actually ever agree that they should all be ITN/R? Joseph2302 (talk) 15:56, 11 November 2021 (UTC) Feel free to make a proposal to establish whether there is still a consensus for these at ITNR. This particular venue is not the appropriate place as the item in question currently is ITNR. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 16:12, 11 November 2021 (UTC) This is a direct question about the validity of the ITN/R process to put it on ITNR. Unless someone points to an actual discussion/consensus for space flights being ITN/R, it shouldn't be considered so. That somebody seems to have unilaterally added it many years ago is not a reason to call it ITN/R. Joseph2302 (talk) 16:36, 11 November 2021 (UTC) No, to question the validity of something listed at ITNR, start a thread at WT:ITN. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 16:47, 11 November 2021 (UTC) Someone specifically suggested excluding routine ISS crew rotations over 10 years ago. The discussion just seemed to fizzle out without a conclusion. Andrew?(talk) 16:31, 11 November 2021 (UTC) At another similar discussion, someone else said, "As has been noted, this seems to come up every so often, everyone seems in broad agreement that it needs to change when it does so, and then somehow it fizzles out with nothing being done. Therefore I'm going to be bold and change it ...". That discussion wasn't formally closed either and so the ITN/R entry represents a unilateral bold update rather than some considered consensus. Andrew?(talk) 17:42, 11 November 2021 (UTC) I specifically raised this and proposed modification a year ago after Crew 1. It's no good people complaining when something is nominated in WP:ITNC when they don't say anything when it's raised at the appropriate venue. -- KTC (talk) 21:23, 11 November 2021 (UTC) KTC made a good point at ITN/R but there was low attendance at the discussion and no formal close. It seems clear that ITN/R lacks the participation required to establish a solid consensus. ITN/C is the place that gets the attendance because it's linked on the main page. It's therefore ITN/C that should drive the outcomes. Andrew?(talk) 23:41, 11 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose routine event, and claim of ITN/R is not correct, as the ITN/R for space flights seems to have been added without consensus to do so. Joseph2302 (talk) 16:36, 11 November 2021 (UTC) Also, lots of information in the infobox is not sourced anywhere in the article, and there's an over-reliance on tweets, which are primary sources.

InedibleHulk (talk) 12:25, 12 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: on one hand, this is (currently) on ITNR and the article is in reasonable shape - the orange tags seem overkill to me. On the other hand, it's a routine crew rotation, I've been arguing those shouldn't be on ITNR for a decade, and the current discussion on WT:ITN seems to have general agreement that ITNR shouldn't cover this sort of flight, even if it doesn't agree on exactly what the new wording should be. I encourage further participation in that discussion. Modest Genius talk 14:05, 12 November 2021 (UTC) Posting The result of the discussion so far is that the article quality is sufficient and the item is on ITNR. Some editors disagree with the ITNR criteria, which seems like a reasonable position to consider. However, the decision whether to post this ITN item is not sufficiently important to invoke IAR. Those who think ITNR should be altered are invited to go make that change. Until it happens, this item should be posted.

I suggest editors who want this posted go address the concerns about infobox information needing citations. This should be easy and quick to fix, and then it can be posted. Jehochman Talk 14:38, 12 November 2021 (UTC) (edit conflict) Jehochman Are you kidding me? You've clearly ignored all the unsourced text in the infobox, this fails the article quality threshold. I see you removed the valid tags, ignored this quality discussion and the one on the article talkpage, and want to post this anyway. Try fixing all the cn tags before posting, rather than just removing tags. Joseph2302 (talk) 14:40, 12 November 2021 (UTC) And I raised the quality concerns 22 hours ago, and nobody has even touched them, so don't imagine it'll be fixed anytime soon. Infobox seems like a whole load of WP:SPECULATION to me. Joseph2302 (talk) 14:42, 12 November 2021 (UTC) I'm trying to find any info on the launch and landing mass, but no luck so far. Scaramouche33 (talk) 17:53, 12 November 2021 (UTC) When the sourced content is crap trivia (or more politely, "NASA PR") like The first astronauts of this NASA Astronaut Group 22 (nicknamed The Turtles) to fly to space, Raja Chari and Kayla Barron on SpaceX Crew-3 took a stuffed turtle as zero-g indicator, to pay a tribute to their astronaut group. Additionally, to include the other crew members on board, Matthias Maurer and Tom Marshburn, the turtle was named "Pfau", a German word meaning "Peacock" for Matthias Maurer who is German, and for Tom Marshburn who was part of NASA Astronaut Group 19 (nicknamed The Peacock). I didn't even bother checking for non-sourced content. User:? (powera, ?, ?) 17:07, 12 November 2021 (UTC) If you can improve the article, please do. Jehochman Talk 01:12, 13 November 2021 (UTC) I can't improve it. It is fully sourced and contains all the important information about the event. The problem is that there is so little important information to cover that the article also has to include unimportant information to not be a stub. Also, I agree that per policy this should be posted; it's not worth being brave to early-close the talk page discussion to remove this from ITNR immediately. User:? (powera, ?, ?) 16:59, 13 November 2021 (UTC) As I've said of ITNR before, it should be that any discussion about the rational for posting the broad categories of events should not be debated at ITNC on the basis there was consensus for the ITNR, but individual ITNR noms can be deemed to be so insignificant as exceptions from the category (as this appears to have qualified) as a type of IAR to the ITNR approach. This is of course in addition to the article quality aspects. ITNR is not a blood pact that we have to post every thing that fits. EG: about a year ago there was that Martian (?) sample collector that was first nom'd when it arrived in orbit (which was ITRN) but we decided to wait until news of the sample collection (the first of its sort) as the more notable event. That's the type of logic that should be behind judging ITNR. --Masem (t) 17:12, 13 November 2021 (UTC) The missing citations were fixed. Two uncited facts remained, and I just removed them because if we can't find a source after a full day of looking, that calls those facts into question. I will repost this in a moment. Feel free to continue discussion. Jehochman Talk 01:12, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Post-posting Comment – It's now the least interesting blurb in the box. – Sca (talk) 13:53, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Agree. Now would be a good time to recommend changing the ITNR criteria for human space flight. Jehochman Talk 15:36, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Post-posting Oppose more people being sent to space for little reason, aside from routine? Why is this “news”? 2A01:4C8:481:753A:912B:C8B8:F206:CFDF (talk) 14:21, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Post-posting oppose. Routine enough event that it'd never have been approved if it wasn't spaceflight-related. This is systemic bias at work. Jehochman, please reevaluate your determination of consensus here. {{u|Sdkb}}?talk 20:05, 14 November 2021 (UTC) It's still ITNR, so all Jehochman has to do is assess article quality, as you well know having just voted on the proposal to remove spaceflight entirely from ITNR. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 20:14, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Pull - Consensus on ITNR is trending heavily against news items of this sort. The right thing to do would be to remove this from ITN.--WaltCip-(talk) 21:41, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Nah, you can't retrospectively apply a trend. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 21:44, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Where there's a will.... – Sca (talk) 13:16, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Strikes me as churlish and petty now it's been there a few days. And after all, no actual readers have complained about its presence, just some who are lawyering around the edges of the process. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 13:19, 15 November 2021 (UTC) WP:NPA – Sca (talk) 13:28, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Um, you know the P stands for "personal", right? Oh dear. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 13:32, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Churlish and petty are words characterizing personal acts or traits, are they not?. – Sca (talk) 14:35, 15 November 2021 (UTC) I would oppose any pulling. The discussion on ITN/R about future postings should have no bearing on this one.-- Pawnkingthree (talk) 14:37, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose pulling. This was validly posted and should be left alone. If the next one is not under ITNR, fair enough(though I disagree with its total removal) but this one that was validly posted does not need to be removed. 331dot (talk) 13:21, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Support pulling nobody demonstrated this was important enough for ITN, they just used "it's ITNR" as justification. And the discussion has disproved that justification, as consensus is that it's not important. It was a nomination predicated on an untrue assertion. I would support doing the pull as a replacement when the next ITN blurb is added, so we don't have too little content on ITN. Joseph2302 (talk) 14:41, 15 November 2021 (UTC) That does not change that it was a valid posting when it was made. I don't think we should retroactively change policies. 331dot (talk) 14:42, 15 November 2021 (UTC) The discussion above is closed. Please do not modify it. Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page. No further edits should be made to this discussion. References[edit] Nominators often include links to external websites and other references in discussions on this page. It is usually best to provide such links using the inline URL syntax [http://example.com] rather than using <ref></ref> tags, because that keeps all the relevant information in the same place as the nomination without having to jump to this section, and facilitates the archiving process.

Please read the guidelines. Admin instructions are here. ??Skip to suggestions In the news toolbox Error reports Nominations (Archives) Discussion General criteria Death criteria Recurring items Admin guide Image protection Current events portal v t e Shortcut WP:ITN/C This page provides a forum for editors to suggest items for inclusion on In the news (ITN), a protected template on the Main Page, as well as the forum for discussion of candidates. This is not the page to report errors in the ITN section on the Main Page—please go to the appropriate section at WP:ERRORS. Archives of past nominations can be found here. This candidates page is integrated with the daily pages of Portal:Current events. Under each daily section header below is the transcluded Portal:Current events items for that day (with a light green header). Each day's portal page is followed by a subsection for suggestions and discussion. A blurb is a one sentence summary of the news story. An alternate suggestion for the blurb is called an altblurb, and any more suggestions get labelled alt1, alt2, etc. A blurb needs at least one target article, highlighted in bold; reviewers check the quality of that article and whether it is updated, and whether reliable sources demonstrate the significance of the event. Other articles can also be linked. The Ongoing line is for regularly updated articles which cover events that remain in the news over a longer period of time. RD stands for the "recent deaths" line, and can include any living thing whose death was recently announced. In some cases, recent deaths may need additional explanation as provided by a blurb; this is decided by consensus.

Ongoing: Belarus–European Union border crisis COVID-19 pandemic Recent deaths: Young Dolph Julio Lugo Ed Bullins Bertie Auld Seán FitzPatrick Art Stewart Nominate an article view — page history — related changes — edit How to nominate an item[edit] In order to suggest a candidate: Update an article to be linked to from the blurb to include the recent developments, or find an article that has already been updated. Find the correct section below for the date of the event (not the date nominated). Do not add sections for new dates. These are automatically generated (at midnight UTC) by a bot; creating them manually breaks this process. Nominate the blurb for ITN inclusion under the "Suggestions" subheading for the date, emboldening the link in the blurb to the updated article. Use a level 4 header (====) when doing so. Preferably use the template {{ITN candidate}} to nominate the article related to the event in the news. Make sure that you include a reference from a verifiable, reliable secondary source. Press releases are not acceptable. The suggested blurb should be written in simple present tense. Adding an explanation why the event should be posted greatly increases the odds of posting. Please consider alerting editors to the nomination by adding the template {{ITN note}} to the corresponding article's talk page. Purge this page to update the cache There are criteria which guide the decision on whether or not to put a particular item on In the news, based largely on the extensiveness of the updated content and the perceived significance of the recent developments. These are listed at WP:ITN. Submissions that do not follow the guidelines at Wikipedia:In the news will not be placed onto the live template. Headers[edit] Items that have been posted or pulled from the main page are generally marked with (Posted) or (Pulled) in the item's subject so it is clear they are no longer active. Items can also be marked as (Ready) when the article is both updated and there seems to be a consensus to post. The posting admin, however, should always judge the update and the consensus to post themselves. If you find an entry that you don't feel is ready to post is marked (Ready), you should remove the mark in the header. Voicing an opinion on an item[edit] Format your comment to contain "support" or "oppose", and include a rationale for your choice. In particular, address the notability of the event, the quality of the article, and whether it has been updated. Please do not...[edit] add simple "support!" or "oppose!" votes without including your reasons. Similarly, curt replies such as "who?", "meh", or "duh!" are usually not helpful. Instead, explain the reasons why you think the item meets or does not meet the ITN inclusion criteria so a consensus can be reached. oppose an item because the event is only relating to a single country, or failing to relate to one. This applies to a high percentage of the content we post and is unproductive. accuse other editors of supporting, opposing or nominating due to a personal bias (such as ethnocentrism). Conflicts of interest are not handled at ITN. comment on a story without first reading the relevant article(s). oppose a recurring item here because you disagree with the recurring items criteria. The criteria can be discussed at the relevant talk page.

Joseph2302 (talk) 20:40, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: Perhaps the blurb can mention the evacuation of thousands of residents and the destruction of infrastructure. Power outage and a small death toll won't cut it. --PFHLai (talk) 22:35, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Comment - this is quite a significant event in Canada, with reports that it could become the most expensive natural disaster in Canadian history [4], the death toll is expected to rise, along with wide ranging effects on supply chains and transportation networks. If I recall correctly, I think we did post the 2013 Alberta floods, for precedent. Connormah (talk) 22:39, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I guess "could be" is key here. If it does become the most expensive natural disaster after electing Trudeau in the history of Canada, then it's well placed for a blurb. Maybe now is premature. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:42, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Wait Living through this, it's a pretty devastating disaster, with all road access cut off to and from the Port of Vancouver, which is having a major impact on supply chains across Western Canada. But I don't think this meets the standard previously set for ITN just yet, although there are reports that the death toll is expected to rise. There's also reports of an imminent dike breach into a large city. As such, I'd suggest that we wait.

(Post) Alternative blurb: ?Russia shoots down Kosmos 1408 with an anti-satellite weapon, creating a field of space debris. Alternative blurb II: ?Kosmos 1408 is destroyed by a Russian anti-satellite weapon and turned into a stream of space debris. News source(s): BBC, AP, Reuters, Guardian, Bloomberg Credits: Nominated by Andrew Davidson (talk · give credit) Created by Mike Peel (talk · give credit) Updated by Smeagol 17 (talk · give credit) Article updated Nominator's comments: We have some real news about the ISS now as the crew have to take shelter from a shower of debris created by a Russian missile test. And the Kessler syndrome advances another notch. What we're mainly missing is a good picture but we might use something generic like this. Andrew?(talk) 12:56, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support in principle, as this is a significant event for the space industry (more so than Crew-3 that we already have on the template). However the article is pretty lightweight and could use some expansion. It also needs a source for the claim that Russia was responsible for the test - we can't claim something in the blurb that isn't cited in the article. I would also remove 'dangerous' from the blurb as that's quite a strong accusation. Modest Genius talk 13:05, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Article seems fine now, though as I was one of the users updating it an independent assessment would be welcome. Modest Genius talk 18:16, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support on the merits; the use of an anti-satellite weapon(even as a test) is rare and few countries possess such technology. Russia isn't denying it. 331dot (talk) 13:10, 16 November 2021 (UTC) @331dot: Yes, the use is rare and few countries possess such technology. Yet, I remember a similar test from India a couple of years ago was rejected as the technology "has been around for a while." If I recall correctly, there had been significant debate about debris back then too. 2405:201:4013:8087:A828:E291:B9B5:4B09 (talk) 18:31, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I can only comment on the nomination in front of me; I can't speak to past ones at this time. 331dot (talk) 19:15, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support in principle though article needs to include that Russia shot it down (right now, the article just says it broke up). And other cn tags in article would need fixing. Though I agree, this is way more important/notable/covered in news sources than Crew-3. Joseph2302 (talk) 13:12, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Comment I started putting this through DYK earlier today, see Template:Did you know nominations/Kosmos 1408, since I haven't enjoyed participating in previous ITN discussions. But if you want this here, then the DYK can be withdrawn. I've updated the template above, since I started the article yesterday. Thanks. Mike Peel (talk) 13:14, 16 November 2021 (UTC) One option would be to merge this into the existing Crew-3 ISS mission blurb. If Kosmos 1408 is not bolded then it can still be a DYK too. Andrew?(talk) 13:22, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I oppose merging those blurbs - these are separate events. Modest Genius talk 14:07, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I also oppose merging- they're separate events, and this one is more important, so shouldn't be stuck on the end of some less important and newswirthy article that's only on the front page because it was alledgedly ITNR (even though that ITNR criteria was demonstrated to be unfit for purpose). And if this does reach front page, then DYK would no longer be eligible, but until that point, don't see a need to withdraw the DYK nom. Joseph2302 (talk) 14:30, 16 November 2021 (UTC) We could remove the Crew-3 blurb and replace it with this one when this is ready to go (assuming Crew-3 is still on ITN). Yeah, it doesn't get its "full time" there, but I agree that it doesn't make sense to merge, but having two ISS-related things could be seen as overwhelming the box. --Masem (t) 14:35, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – Fairly widely covered, but broader significance of a "threat" to the ISS isn't so apparent. – Sca (talk) 13:38, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Even a fleck of paint could seriously damage the ISS, one of the most expensive objects ever constructed. 331dot (talk) 11:14, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support in principle. This is very significant news and an interesting story of high encyclopedic value.--Kiril Simeonovski (talk) 13:41, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support in principle per above, just needs better fleshing out of the article. --Masem (t) 13:53, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – Upon reflection, it seems to be a serious threat all right, but ... can we post something that hasn't had a tangible effect ... yet? – Sca (talk) 14:11, 16 November 2021 (UTC) PS: My question is, did Putin authorize this stupid 'test' – or was it just an act of heedless military apparatchiks down in the bureaucracy? (Russia is an oligarchy that has a country – a country that has an enormous military.) – Sca (talk) 14:19, 16 November 2021 (UTC) The way I'm reading it, the story is more that Russia has appeared to have violated a treaty related to space-bound weapons, in addition to this being a story of interest to space exploration (the potential of damage to the ISS that forced the crew to shelter for at least two orbits as it passed through the debris field). --Masem (t) 14:17, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Reasonable enough. However, the threat to human lives (including two Russians!) seems more compelling in terms of reader interest. – Sca (talk) 14:22, 16 November 2021 (UTC) From our article on the Outer Space Treaty: "Although it forbids establishing military bases, testing weapons and conducting military maneuvers on celestial bodies, the treaty does not expressly ban all military activities in space, nor the establishment of military space forces or the placement of conventional weapons in space". Testing an anti-satellite weapon on your own target is not against any treaty, just regarded as irresponsible. Note that the US, China and India have all conducted similar tests with no legal repercussions or UN censure. Modest Genius talk 15:09, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose no longer fresh, not really in the news, rolled off a while ago and probably better suited for DYK. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 16:11, 16 November 2021 (UTC) What's your time frame for "no longer fresh"? The BBC article is only 12 hours old and the event itself occurred yesterday. It's certainly a newer event than anything currently in the ITN box... --Jayron32 16:16, 16 November 2021 (UTC) (edit conflict) The BBC published two more articles about this story in just the last hour [5] [6]. That seems pretty fresh. Modest Genius talk 16:19, 16 November 2021 (UTC) It happened yesterday, and is very much still in the news. Much more so than the posted blurbs, such as the NYC Marathon on 7 November for example. Joseph2302 (talk) 16:20, 16 November 2021 (UTC) OH sure, you can dig into websites and find more analysis, but it's not headline news and hasn't been for most of the day now. Even the article makes it clear that the "main event" has passed. Biggest headlines in the UK are now that Johnson is proposing to prevent MPs from getting paid consultancy jobs. This story is no longer even on the BBC News homepage. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 16:24, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support Article is short, but sufficient; it seems to have developed some since the earlier notes. Topic is being covered by reliable news sources. --Jayron32 16:17, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose ... for now. Article text comprises 340 words, of which 115 are background, leaving a mere 230 words about the current threat. IMO, too thin for MP promotion. Second, we shouldn't blurb something that hasn't had an impact (yet). – Sca (talk) 17:03, 16 November 2021 (UTC) PS: Given that the current situation could continue for quite some time, perhaps after a bit we should consider posting this directly to Ongoing. – Sca (talk) 17:10, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Whatever political fallout there has been is pretty much so far just a short but important burst (for blurb posting), but there's no sign this is going to escalate into something further, in comparison to the nuclear submarine sale a few months back. --Masem (t) 19:50, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Wait is there a real danger debris hits other satellites soon, or is this just "an abundance of caution"? Will there be significant geo-political ramifications from the test? Until one of those is "yes", I think we should wait. User:? (powera, ?, ?) 19:52, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Everywhere is at risk for disaster, but this info is nothing like disaster actually happening. Political story, and involving two countries who always bicker. Could change if the ISS is destroyed or something stronger than words breaks out. InedibleHulk (talk) 20:46, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Is this an RD nom for the destruction of Kosmos 1408? If so, its "career section" needs an expansion to describe how it was used while still in orbit and operational.--PFHLai (talk) 23:08, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Questionable significance as far as potential impacts, especially given at the moment it is just predictive. I would assume that the test itself is not sufficient for ITN, so I'm on the "Oppose" side here. DarkSide830 (talk) 00:01, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support even if nothing happens to the ISS, ASAT weapon tests don't happen every day, or even every year. Banedon (talk) 03:44, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support Certainly magnitudes more important than the multitude of launches posted every now and then on ITN. Gotitbro (talk) 07:09, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support significant, made the news and the article Kosmos 1408 is short but adequate. Given the military nature of this satellite and its destruction, we can't expect to know that many details. Of the proposed blurbs, only alt 1 is good. --LukeSurl t c 10:02, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support in principle this is a significant story BUT it simply cannot be posted with a blurb of this quality. Its language is misleading and makes it sound as if a functional satellite was attacked, but rather a defunct satellite was destroyed as part of a weapons test... slightly different. Possibly also include the name of the missile system, if known, and replace "Russia" with the actual agency overseeing the test. JMonkey2006 (talk) 11:10, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Feel free to propose a different blurb. Or we could simply add 'defunct' before the name of the satellite. Modest Genius talk 11:38, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – Absent from main RS sites on Wednesday; no longer in the news. Seems a minor issue without tangible effects. Neither target article is really about this event. – Sca (talk) 12:42, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support in principle per JMonkey. Fakescientist8000 (talk) 13:54, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support. The Kessler syndrome may have been triggered: "The Kessler syndrome is troublesome because of the domino effect and feedback runaway wherein impacts between objects of sizable mass spall off debris from the force of the collision. The fragments can then hit other objects, producing even more space debris: if a large enough collision or explosion were to occur, such as between a space station and a defunct satellite, or as the result of hostile actions in space, then the resulting debris cascade could make prospects for long-term viability of satellites in particular low Earth orbits extremely low." Count Iblis (talk) 14:52, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support - Russia is weaponizing space. Whether or not they were the first to do it - and presumably they weren't - this is an indication of a change in global affairs when it comes to outer space.--WaltCip-(talk) 16:16, 17 November 2021 (UTC) If you didn't know (see anti-satellite weapon), the first ASAT test was in 1959, and was conducted by the US. Banedon (talk) 02:06, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Comment any admins around here to post this? I oppose its inclusion as it's already stale in my opinion, but there's a pretty clear consensus here and the longer it's left unposted, the staler it becomes....

Comments should focus on whether the quality of the article and update meet WP:ITNCRIT, not the significance. Nominator's comments: Second election held yesterday, ITNR, being a general election. The election comission has announced that We Continue the Change has won most seats, so therefore such a nomination can now be made. As we have posted the winner in the previous elections, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:In_the_news/Candidates/July_2021#(Posted)_Bulgarian_parliamentary_election. They are a new party too, so surprising. I have added a result synopsis and started the aftermath. Good article, have spent a lot of time on it myself with a few others. BastianMAT (talk) 14:45, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Support Article has minimum of prose describing the leadup, results, and aftermath. More writing would be nice, but it's passable for the main page. Everything is referenced and it has prose, which is more than can be said for many of the nominations of this type. --Jayron32 12:01, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: Is it time to start the English wikibio for the other co-leader of We Continue the Change, Asen Vasilev? The coalition has two leaders, not just Petkov. Do we want to wait till a government is formed? --PFHLai (talk) 12:01, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I guess yeah, he deserves one too, but Petkov is the primary focus here as he is the one seeking to become prime minister (per https://www.euronews.com/2021/11/14/bulgarian-elections-newly-formed-pp-party-neck-and-neck-with-right-wing-gerb-party). The truth is we don't even know yet if they will be successful forming a goverment, but we posted both the Czech party SPOLU and the last Bulgarian election when ITN won the most seats as the election itself is ITNR, so going by that this nomination/blurb should be suitable to make it out to the front page.BastianMAT (talk) 12:17, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support Article is in great shape. I think the easiest way to solve what PFHLai exposes is to put in the blurb that Petkov is the "co-leader", thus making it understood that he is not the only one leading the coalition. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 12:42, 16 November 2021 (UTC) How about not mentioning either co-leaders in the blurb? (See alt1) I'm not sure about using the proposed photo of Petkov on MainPage, anyway. --PFHLai (talk) 22:40, 16 November 2021 (UTC) We can do that too if there are any issues with the image, no problem. BastianMAT (talk) 16:44, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support altblurb1 Just updated the numbers of the results, the article is well-written --Vacant0 (talk) 22:56, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support article looks good enough, would say this is ready.

Remember, go for it!. Fakescientist8000 (talk) 15:19, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Comment I wanted to nominate this but hasitated. Are these midterms considered general elections? Half of the seats in the lower chamber and 1/3 of the upper chamber are up for election and our article defines general elections as "elections in which all or most members of a political body are chosen." Scaramouche33 (talk) 16:16, 15 November 2021 (UTC) I half-wondered if such "mid-term" elections were covered by ITNR. If they are, perhaps that should also be explicitly noted at ITNR. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 16:19, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Yeah, mid terms elections are part of it, it is notable too as the ruling party have lost their majority. Here is the US one that was also posted. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:In_the_news/Candidates/November_2018#(Posted)_2018_US_Midterm_Elections.BastianMAT (talk) 16:28, 15 November 2021 (UTC) But that was mainly because it involved "all or most members of a political body are chosen". This doesn't appear to be the case here. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 16:44, 15 November 2021 (UTC) It depends on how you see on it. The mid term senate elections in US only feature 34 members up running for election. In Argentina it was half of the congress and enough for an significant change in both political bodies (ruling party losing control of both the house and the senate).BastianMAT (talk) 16:53, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Well it doesn't matter what happened in the US, how does this meet the requirements at ITNR? The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 16:59, 15 November 2021 (UTC) From what I understand, in the US midterms all House seats+1/3 of Senate seats were up for election so that would be considered as "most members of an electoral body" but here it's only half. Does that still count as general elections? If so it's ITN/R, if not who knows. Scaramouche33 (talk) 17:14, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Yeah I agree, it is arguable for both sides. At least based on this, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midterm_election, Argentina[1] (legislative and local election) falls under the heading General elections (which makes it ITNR) alongside the United States (legislative and local election) which was posted.BastianMAT (talk) 17:17, 15 November 2021 (UTC) I'm not sure it is arguable here, it doesn't meet the definition in ITNR and it's a mid-term, not a general election by any normal definition (despite what "Wikipedia" might say). The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 17:30, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – First four grafs back into the results and seem needlessly complex. – Sca (talk) 17:19, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Comment the table in the infobox violates MOS:COLHEAD by having column headers in the middle of the table. And we shouldn't consider putting this on front page until the results are complete, as a minimum. Joseph2302 (talk) 17:22, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Comment Blurbs are needlessly complex. Would support if blurb was simpler. Pyramids09 (talk) 18:31, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Added AltBlurb 3 as a simplified version of AltBlurb 1, which was the better of the prior three for highlighting the historical significance of the results.

I believe it's the first bombing in England since 2017 Manchester Arena one, and caused the UK terror threat level to be increased. Article itself is good enough quality.

The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 18:04, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose This was a minor terrorist attack that caused only one casualty. Now we are not concerned about the number of victims? Certainly "is in the news", but I don't think it has the same relevance as other terrorist incidents that have occurred that have not been approved to be on Main Page. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 18:33, 16 November 2021 (UTC) The perpetrator was killed and the taxi driver was hospitalised. Martinevans123 (talk) 18:40, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. Failed attack which caused one injury and killed the attacker. It's not clear what the target was or who it was supposed to terrorise. If this hadn't been declared a terrorist incident it would be minor local news. I encourage the existing DYK nom instead. Modest Genius talk 19:02, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Regardless of terrorism tag, I suspect this would have been national news. But of course, we will never know. The fact is it is big national news. Martinevans123 (talk) 19:07, 16 November 2021 (UTC) But it was declared a terrorist attack, which adds notability to the incident. Jbvann05 20:32, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Not really, it just grants the police additional powers and generates more headlines. The actual event doesn't become any worse. Modest Genius talk 13:18, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Support alt Notable, now declared a terrorist incident, article in decent shape.  Spy-cicle?  Talk? 19:15, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support - Terrorism need not have a high death count in order to be notable and newsworthy; we have posted terrorist incidents on ITN that have had a death toll of zero.--WaltCip-(talk) 20:04, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Comment I find it very interesting how many of those who support this nomination refused to publish the terrorist attack in Auckland in September, whose consequences were almost the same as in this case. Any clarification? _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 20:58, 16 November 2021 (UTC) What do you mean "refused to publish"? They didn't !vote there. Apart from Modest Genius, who is opposed here also? Martinevans123 (talk) 21:05, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you for your answer because clearly I've realized that I have not expressed myself well. I mean that at the time, the reason why I've opposed was the same used by other users (who have not participated in this debate, except Modest Genius) to not support the cited nomination in September. That is why I am frankly surprised. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 21:29, 16 November 2021 (UTC) BLP Caution One suspect is dead, but four others are arrested in connection; might want to attribute this "attempted terrorist bombing" instead of stating it as a fact Wikipedia knows (a "declaration" from police is still an allegation). InedibleHulk (talk) 21:37, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Counter Terrorism Police Caution: all four have been released: [7]. Martinevans123 (talk) 21:50, 16 November 2021 (UTC) OK, nevermind then. Can't go wrong speaking ill of the dead. At least by Wikipedian norms. InedibleHulk (talk) 22:10, 16 November 2021 (UTC) No need to get personal, if you don't mind. Norman Butkiss 123 (talk) 22:47, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. I will admit to perhaps being more jaded to bomb stories than some other nationalities may be, but even with that notwithstanding, I don't believe we'd be considering an attack which killed no victims and injured one if it took place elsewhere (we recently didn't post, for example, an attack that targeted but didn't kill a head of state). That isn't necessarily to say there's any deliberate bias here but it's important to remember that England has a well-developed media sphere and any regional story will have a lot of domestic coverage, but we are not necessarily beholden to repeat their biases. For reference, even the BBC have displaced this story in favour of the latest update in a racism dispute in county cricket. ??????? ? 21:46, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support major incident, leading news story, article decent. Polyamorph (talk) 21:48, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support (Alt 2). UK terror threat level raised from substantial to severe pushes it over the edge. Martinevans123 (talk) 23:15, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose As suicide in Britain goes, it was unusually public and explosive, but lacks too much death and destruction next to the general public suicide bombings (a similar story from Strathroy-Caradoc#History isn't even an article, for context). InedibleHulk (talk) 23:19, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose -- it's already stopped being news, it seems. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 02:50, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Questionable significance since nothing major [fortunately] did not take place. Gotitbro (talk) 07:12, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose as the investigation has not been completed and it has not been confirmed yet whether it was terrorism, whether the detonation was intentional or accidental, or who the intended victim or victims might to have been. The current article contains too much opinion, innuendo, and speculation portrayed as fact. -- DeFacto (talk). 07:38, 17 November 2021 (UTC) By all means mark any "opinion, innuendo, and speculation portrayed as fact" and/or take to the talk page. Opinion is generally permitted if it's clearly attributed? Thanks. Martinevans123 (talk) 11:21, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Very Strong Oppose Per WP:Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, we are supposed to be an encyclopedia, and we are NOT supposed to be a dangerous free publicity machine for every murderous suicidal nutter, still less for every would-be terrorist and every terrorist organisation. So a terrorist incident should be truly exceptional and notable before appearing on our front page, all the more so as it is often liable to remain there giving dangerous free publicity (and thus in practice encouragement) to terrorists and other murderous nutters long after it has disappeared from the front pages of other mainstream Western news outlets (as many terrorists probably already realize, even if many editors around here seemingly don't). There is NOTHING in this incident that gives it the required exceptionality and notability to justify the danger this poses to innocent people, as well as the damage it might (rightly in my view) do to our reputation. Tlhslobus (talk) 18:15, 17 November 2021 (UTC) See WP:RIGHTGREATWRONGS. Your diatribe is interesting, but nothing to do with ITNC, otherwise we'd never publish another mass shooting in the US ever again. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 18:27, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose No lasting effect plus terrible disjointed article means it's a No from me, Bob. Black Kite (talk) 18:23, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose The story stopped trending yesterday, and the death/injury toll is very low (luckily). If attacks of this kind were rare in the UK I would be willing to overlook these factors, but (unfortunately) there's been a seemingly-steady uptick in the last couple of years, so there's nothing about this that makes it stand out. Mount Patagonia (talk) 18:27, 17 November 2021 (UTC) But the satellite blow-up stopped trending 36 hours ago and no-one died. Terror attacks where bombs are ignited on Remembrance Day are few and far between, I'm sure you can point me to the last time that happened, right? The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 18:29, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I was referencing upticks in UK-based terror attacks in general, not ones falling on Rememberance Day. If terror attacks that fell on special occasions were automatic shoe-ins, then last year's Christmas bombing in Nashville would have been posted, but it wasn't for the same reasons I'm opposing posting this story. For the Russian satellite, take it up with the people for voted for it because I had no involvement in that decision. Mount Patagonia (talk) 22:06, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Indeed, terror attacks often happen on supposedly significant days or dates (sometimes perhaps coincidentally, sometimes perhaps as part of an attempt to increase the attack's psychological impact, or perhaps sometimes for quasi-religious reasons). Not only do we not use this as an excuse to put it into ITN, we sometimes leave it out of the article as well. For instance it was 5 years before Wikipedia mentioned that the Bataclan attacks occurred on Friday the 13th and there is still no link from it to the article about the superstition, presumably because RS don't mention such a link (perhaps to avoid making vulnerable people more fearful or otherwise psychologically distressed or harmed whenever 'significant' dates approach). Tlhslobus (talk) 15:33, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Comment we don't need to name the perp in any of the blurbs. That's totally undue. Get a grip people. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 18:30, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I've been bold and removed the name of the perp. We don't need that, even if this isn't posted, anywhere near this encyclopedia. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 20:17, 17 November 2021 (UTC) The name of the perpetrator is encyclopedic and should be in the article; but I agree that it should not be posted in ITN regardless. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 00:14, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose No victims and unclear / unorganised motive. Belugsump (talk) 03:44, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – Limited significance. No longer in the news. – Sca (talk) 13:06, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose.

Some activists are critical of the agreement, as it leaves unresolved the question of how much and how quickly each nation should cut its carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions over the next decade, and it still leaves many developing countries short of the funds that they would need in order to cope with increasing weather disasters. However, the agreement makes reference to fossil fuels and their role in the climate crisis for the first time in the conference's history.

Once this is updated, I will probably support on importance. User:? (powera, ?, ?) 02:52, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose there's at least enough article to vote. Article still has issues; the "Pledges" section is describing things agreed at the conference that don't appear to be specifically part of the "Glasgow Climate Pact", and the link to Wikisource isn't broken. As far as importance ... we posted the conference once, and the biggest news is that there are plans to decrease coal usage ... this isn't worth posting again. User:? (powera, ?, ?) 01:06, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Support – in principle ... pending updating and succinct revision of 2021 climate conference article. It would be very odd not to blurb this universally covered confab, now over. – Sca (talk) 13:44, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Comment That we already posted the COP26 earlier, and that the general impression of the Glasgow Pact that I get from sources is that it is far less as a milestone compared to the Paris Agreements (since it basically affirms commitment to them) makes me wonder if this is really that significant to post a second time. --Masem (t) 14:23, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Au contraire. Despite disappointments, 'world leaders' said to "broadly welcome" the climate deal, which "for the first time targeted fossil fuels." At least they did something. Prominently covered by every major RS site. – Sca (talk) 15:28, 14 November 2021 (UTC) That sentence wasn't over. First time targeting fossil fuels "as the key driver of global warming". Whatever that means. InedibleHulk (talk) 16:29, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Resistance is futile. "In asking nations to set tougher targets by next year for cutting climate-warming emissions, the agreement effectively acknowledged that commitments were still inadequate. National pledges currently have the world on track for about 2.4C of warming." The article quality outlook is also dire. InedibleHulk (talk) 16:38, 14 November 2021 (UTC) We're not here to judge the work of the conferees. We're here to take note a very heavily covered, extended international conference that was widely and prominently covered. Do I think the so-called climate pact will solve global warming? No (although it might be a move in the right direction). What you or I think of it doesn't matter. What matters is, it was/is very much in the news, and the topic is hugely significant. – Sca (talk) 17:32, 14 November 2021 (UTC) The work of the conferees is the topic. If the news reports the commitments made therein as inadequate, it's not hugely significant in the broader and more newsworthy topic area of global warming prevention. This running conference is just in the news because it was long expected to end today somehow. InedibleHulk (talk) 17:45, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Nope. Even if they had done nothing it would be significant for reasons outlined above. – Sca (talk) 17:49, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I respectfully disagree. InedibleHulk (talk) 17:54, 14 November 2021 (UTC) If we hadn't posted the COP26 thing earlier, I would have been fine with posting this as an ending point as generally the overall conference was in the news. But given that we already did and this new piece is not a major piece of environmental commitment compared to the Paris Agreement, double posting this is just not appropriate. --Masem (t) 22:25, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose article is short and unsourced in places. Also, given the Paris Agreement exists, it seems the impact of this is minimal (limited only to reducing coal). Joseph2302 (talk) 09:00, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Support on the merits; it's unusual for 197 countries to agree to any single document, even if largely a statement of principles or desires. But agree it is not yet suitable for posting. 331dot (talk) 10:02, 15 November 2021 (UTC) It should be pointed out that not all 190-some signing countries are committed to the same parts of the document: for example, only 40+ are on board with coal reduction. Hence why this is far less impactful as the Paris Agreements. --Masem (t) 13:41, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Support original blurb in principle, oppose on quality. The pact is a bit of a damp squib, far less ambitious than expected or required. However we're not here to judge the outcome, just whether it meets the ITN criteria. This is certainly in the news, at or near the top of every quality media outlet. However the pact article is barely a start class and needs some major TLC before being postable. I considered bolding the COP26 article again, but its 'outcomes' section is in even worse state. Modest Genius talk 12:20, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – Conspicuous omission from ITN blurb box. – Sca (talk) 13:05, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Sca As several users have noted, there are quality issues preventing posting.

The article is not good enough for front page quality (as ITN isn't OTD, which likes to post poorly sourced articles), and there's no consensus to post it anyway, as they don't seem to have all agreed anything (as different countries signed different agreements).

I, along with others, consistently oppose attempts to post stories in Ongoing without giving them a blurb first, because most of the time it's lazy, unnecessary and does a disservice to readers who deserve to be told the reason why a story's important. I made an exception here because it's a rare occasion where there's a big constantly-updated story that doesn't really have one catch-all blurb available. Most of the time we should be blurbing before we put things into Ongoing, that's just common sense given that the stories are big enough to make the news.  — Amakuru (talk) 15:59, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Exactly who are these "others"?

If you would like to work to amend the guidelines to require a blurb first, please start such a discussion. 331dot (talk) 16:22, 13 November 2021 (UTC) @331dot: you know as well as I do that the guidelines are mostly ignored in ITN discussions, in favour of precedent and unwritten custom. According to our "purpose", we are supposed to "help readers find and quickly access content they are likely to be searching for because an item is in the news" - something we blatantly don't do, because instead we evaluate the significance of everything at ITN/C, under the mantra that we're "not a newsticker". I used to argue the opposite, but at some point you accept the status quo. The same goes here. While the guidelines may suggest that something can go straight to Ongoing, in practice that rarely happens. We blurb stories first and then drop it to Ongoing later, that's simply the way it's always worked. It'd be fantastic if we had a set of proper guidelines that we could follow in all cases, but it would need a bit change in the way the discussions on this page work.  — Amakuru (talk) 19:14, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Throughout my history here I have always worked for the posting of items that I think are in the news and likely to be searched for. This is not 331dot's In The News, it is a community project, and I accept the consensus of what happens here(that's not a criticism of you, but a statement about me.) I do not claim that blurb-ongoing doesn't or shouldn't happen, only that the guidelines do not preclude (and actually encourage) straight-to-Ongoing posting. I would support clarifying that both are possible if there is consensus to do so. 331dot (talk) 19:22, 13 November 2021 (UTC) I agree that most (but not all) of the time, stories should be blurbs before ongoing. If we need to discuss more, perhaps this should move to the talk page. User:? (powera, ?, ?) 19:41, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Posted  — Amakuru (talk) 23:38, 12 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose There are many similar migrant/refugee issues elsewhere. For example, Record high migrant detentions at US-Mexico border; Record number of people cross Channel to UK in small boats; Ocean Viking: Nine-day standoff ends as migrant ship allowed to dock in Sicily; Iran deporting thousands of Afghan refugees. These seem endemic as there's a continuous pressure to move from poor and failed states to more stable and successful ones. It's not clear why this particular border should get attention and how it will stop being an ongoing issue. Andrew?(talk) 14:40, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Are you arguing that this is not receiving news coverage right now?(a genuine question) This is an example of refugees being used as a weapon, as the Belarus dictator has openly said he would do. There does not need to be a clear end date for something in order to post it to Ongoing; its removal can be proposed if it drops out of the news. If you feel other such events should be posted, please nominate them, we can only consider what is nominated. 331dot (talk) 14:47, 13 November 2021 (UTC) All of these hotspots are in the news both now and as ongoing for years. To single one out for special attention, there needs to be some special incident and that is best done as a blurb. As an ongoing entry, the linked article should be something more general such as European migrant crisis or List of largest refugee crises. Note that the latter has four entries which extend to the present day. Andrew?(talk) 21:32, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Weak oppose ongoing, support blurb This seems to be a recent escalation for an ongoing border issue, for which a blurb makes sense IMO. If it's still ongoing by the time it rolls off the template, then it would be fine for ongoing. I know a blurb isn't a specific requirement for items to be added to the ongoing section, but given the inertia common to the ongoing section and the vague timelines that accompany these items (the majority of the time they are removed following lack of regular update for 1-2 weeks), I think encouraging blurbs with roll-over to ongoing should be preferred, and for this item I think makes a lot of sense.

(Support modified as I've now added Altblurb2, detailed explanation to follow below shortly) I was about to propose an altblurb myself before the current altblurb got suggested, and before the blurb got posted, but ran into edit conflict twice, and I see the proposed altblurb is probably a lot more concise than I could have managed. Our blurb should say as concisely as possible something like that he negotiated the end of apartheid with Mandela (concision may or may not require omitting explicit mention of Mandela, as in the current altblurb). After all, that's why he's really notable and worth a blurb. And if we don't say it explicitly (and our posted blurb doesn't) it arguably makes us look a bit racist to the uninformed, on the basis of 'Why would an Apartheid President deserve a blurb?'. I may or may not try to add one or more other altblurbs shortly, simply to mention Mandela, but I suspect other editors may do a better (more concise) job there than me, as I'm usually not very good at concision. Tlhslobus (talk) 13:28, 11 November 2021 (UTC) But we're impressed with your use of the word "concision." – Sca (talk) 13:39, 11 November 2021 (UTC)  ;-) And presumably you're even more impressed with the lack of concision in my use of the word "concision." – Tlhslobus (talk) 13:49, 11 November 2021 (UTC) Well, appropriately, it was your last word (the 175th). – Sca (talk) 14:01, 11 November 2021 (UTC) Not disagreeing on a stronger altblurb, but I would suggest stronger language as he not only backed the end, but (from our article) seemed to actively support steps in dismantling apartheid and making South Africa democratic (obviously he didn't do it alone). Just saying he backed the end seems to be an undercut statement to that point. --Masem (t) 13:37, 11 November 2021 (UTC) I used "backed" as a slightly shorter version of "supported" (ex-jnlst that I am). – Sca (talk) 13:43, 11 November 2021 (UTC) I've now added altblurb2, and amended my support to support it as my preferred altblurb, tho altblurb1 is also OK by me. The advantages of altblurb2 (compared to altblurb1) is that it avoids mentioning 'white', avoids saying 'apartheid' twice, mentions Mandela, and is stronger and more precise than merely 'backed', while still being only slightly longer than altblurb1. (I've already mentioned above the advantages of either altblurb compared to our current posted blurb).

Is there a way to include his Nobel Prize win. --TDKR Chicago 101 (talk) 05:08, 12 November 2021 (UTC) It can be done in several ways. Shortest is perhaps "Nobel-Prize-winning former ...". Alternatively "..., who shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Nelson Mandela for ending apartheid, ...". But I'm neutral on whether it would be a good idea, for several reasons. On the plus side it's fairly important info. On the minus side, it lengthens the blurb. And I had to omit the date to avoid confusion (the prize was 1993, apartheid ended in 1994). And some might argue that it's unnecessary/unbalanced gilding of the lily, and some might want to balance it with a word such as "controversial" (because of his actual or alleged role/responsibility in some of the worst crimes of apartheid, a seemingly still ongoing debate in today's South Africa). Personally I prefer not to risk getting further involved in such an argument.

Article: SpaceX Crew-3 (talk · history · tag) Blurb: ?SpaceX launches four astronauts on the Crew-3 mission to the International Space Station. (Post) News source(s): [15] Credits: Nominated by Scaramouche33 (talk · give credit) Article updated The nominated event is listed on WP:ITN/R, so each occurrence is presumed to be important enough to post. Comments should focus on whether the quality of the article and update meet WP:ITNCRIT, not the significance.Nominator's comments: Crewed missions are ITN/R as far as I know. Scaramouche33 (talk) 05:30, 11 November 2021 (UTC) Support And you know right. I can’t see any issue in the article. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 10:20, 11 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose To post this when we recently denied Captain Kirk would be partisan boosterism. This just seems to be a routine journey without any special newsworthiness. Andrew?(talk) 15:18, 11 November 2021 (UTC) I mean, this one actually went into space space. ??????? ? 15:28, 11 November 2021 (UTC) This wasn't exactly going boldly as the ISS is only 250 miles up – I drove further than that myself yesterday. The main point that the NYT article makes is that this is now over 600 people in space (and they include the Shatner launch in this too). At some point this is routine, rather than special news. Shatner got attention on account of his remarkable age and his celebrity but this launch doesn't have so much going for it. Andrew?(talk) 16:05, 11 November 2021 (UTC) Correct me if I'm wrong, but as far as I know, only crewed missions that go into orbit are considered ITN/R whereas the Blue Origin mission was suborbital. Scaramouche33 (talk) 16:10, 11 November 2021 (UTC) It's ITNR so this opposition can be overlooked. We're here to assess the quality of the article only. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 16:12, 11 November 2021 (UTC) ITNR items do allow to discuss if the specific instance may not be as notable as other elements in broad category (via IAR), though we should not be using ITNC to argue about inclusion of the broad category. (To that end, I have opened a thread at WT:ITN related to removing this ITNR item) --Masem (t) 17:51, 11 November 2021 (UTC) Comment although space flights are listed on ITN/R, there no actual link to a discussion on there (whereas almost every other ITN/R item has actually had a discussion). Did people actually ever agree that they should all be ITN/R? Joseph2302 (talk) 15:56, 11 November 2021 (UTC) Feel free to make a proposal to establish whether there is still a consensus for these at ITNR. This particular venue is not the appropriate place as the item in question currently is ITNR. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 16:12, 11 November 2021 (UTC) This is a direct question about the validity of the ITN/R process to put it on ITNR. Unless someone points to an actual discussion/consensus for space flights being ITN/R, it shouldn't be considered so. That somebody seems to have unilaterally added it many years ago is not a reason to call it ITN/R. Joseph2302 (talk) 16:36, 11 November 2021 (UTC) No, to question the validity of something listed at ITNR, start a thread at WT:ITN. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 16:47, 11 November 2021 (UTC) Someone specifically suggested excluding routine ISS crew rotations over 10 years ago. The discussion just seemed to fizzle out without a conclusion. Andrew?(talk) 16:31, 11 November 2021 (UTC) At another similar discussion, someone else said, "As has been noted, this seems to come up every so often, everyone seems in broad agreement that it needs to change when it does so, and then somehow it fizzles out with nothing being done. Therefore I'm going to be bold and change it ...". That discussion wasn't formally closed either and so the ITN/R entry represents a unilateral bold update rather than some considered consensus. Andrew?(talk) 17:42, 11 November 2021 (UTC) I specifically raised this and proposed modification a year ago after Crew 1. It's no good people complaining when something is nominated in WP:ITNC when they don't say anything when it's raised at the appropriate venue. -- KTC (talk) 21:23, 11 November 2021 (UTC) KTC made a good point at ITN/R but there was low attendance at the discussion and no formal close. It seems clear that ITN/R lacks the participation required to establish a solid consensus. ITN/C is the place that gets the attendance because it's linked on the main page. It's therefore ITN/C that should drive the outcomes. Andrew?(talk) 23:41, 11 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose routine event, and claim of ITN/R is not correct, as the ITN/R for space flights seems to have been added without consensus to do so. Joseph2302 (talk) 16:36, 11 November 2021 (UTC) Also, lots of information in the infobox is not sourced anywhere in the article, and there's an over-reliance on tweets, which are primary sources. And the "Mission" section doesn't actually explain what their mission is (for what reason are they just going up to the ISS)? Joseph2302 (talk) 16:50, 11 November 2021 (UTC) Comment. Note that the toilet has been fixed, so no diapers were needed this time. Count Iblis (talk) 17:12, 11 November 2021 (UTC) Shucks, that was what made the last one interesting. – Sca (talk) 17:26, 11 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose there's no news here, just NASA PR cruft. Should be removed from ITNR. User:? (powera, ?, ?) 18:50, 11 November 2021 (UTC) Agree. – Sca (talk) 19:33, 11 November 2021 (UTC) Support One sentence missing a ref, otherwise its fine. The above opposes are invalid because as of the nomination this is ITNR, full stop.  Nixinova ??T ? C   20:00, 11 November 2021 (UTC) Support as ITN/R Manned spaceflight, article is fine. This post was made by orbitalbuzzsaw gang (talk) 22:59, 11 November 2021 (UTC) Support This event also brings the amount of people ever been to space to above 600, however this is also similar to the denied Captain Kirk proposed story. Rafaelmanman (talk) 23:18, 11 November 2021 (UTC) Wow, 600. What an unimportant number. -- Kicking222 (talk) 10:00, 12 November 2021 (UTC) Without it, there'd be absolutely no way from 599 to 601! But yeah, in space travel context, not at all significant. Just something to beef up the lead section, I assume. InedibleHulk (talk) 12:25, 12 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Routine, unexciting launch. IAR. -- Kicking222 (talk) 10:00, 12 November 2021 (UTC) I actually don't disagree that this is routine, and have proposed excluding such launches from ITNR(but not total removal)- but there is no consensus to do so yet and I don't see a benefit to the encyclopedia in ignoring this "rule". 331dot (talk) 10:05, 12 November 2021 (UTC) Support good to go, article quality sufficient for this ITNR item. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 11:13, 12 November 2021 (UTC) Not ready on quality almost all the infobox information is not sourced in the article- if not sourced in the infobox, it should be added somewhere in the body of the text with sources. This includes all the "Spacecraft properties" information, "End of mission" proposed dates, "Undocking" dates. And using way too many tweets as primary sources instead of actual reliable sources. Good that everyone has ignored these article quality abominations.... Joseph2302 (talk) 11:19, 12 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Easily the least interesting of recent shuttle stories. InedibleHulk (talk) 12:25, 12 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: on one hand, this is (currently) on ITNR and the article is in reasonable shape - the orange tags seem overkill to me. On the other hand, it's a routine crew rotation, I've been arguing those shouldn't be on ITNR for a decade, and the current discussion on WT:ITN seems to have general agreement that ITNR shouldn't cover this sort of flight, even if it doesn't agree on exactly what the new wording should be. I encourage further participation in that discussion. Modest Genius talk 14:05, 12 November 2021 (UTC) Posting The result of the discussion so far is that the article quality is sufficient and the item is on ITNR. Some editors disagree with the ITNR criteria, which seems like a reasonable position to consider. However, the decision whether to post this ITN item is not sufficiently important to invoke IAR. Those who think ITNR should be altered are invited to go make that change. Until it happens, this item should be posted. Maybe it will be the last routine posting of human orbital flights, or maybe not. Feel free to continue the discussion. Consensus may change. Jehochman Talk 14:17, 12 November 2021 (UTC) Now on hold for quality because one editor insists on restoring the orange warning template. I suggest editors who want this posted go address the concerns about infobox information needing citations. This should be easy and quick to fix, and then it can be posted. Jehochman Talk 14:38, 12 November 2021 (UTC) (edit conflict) Jehochman Are you kidding me? You've clearly ignored all the unsourced text in the infobox, this fails the article quality threshold. I see you removed the valid tags, ignored this quality discussion and the one on the article talkpage, and want to post this anyway. Try fixing all the cn tags before posting, rather than just removing tags. Joseph2302 (talk) 14:40, 12 November 2021 (UTC) And I raised the quality concerns 22 hours ago, and nobody has even touched them, so don't imagine it'll be fixed anytime soon. Infobox seems like a whole load of WP:SPECULATION to me. Joseph2302 (talk) 14:42, 12 November 2021 (UTC) I'm trying to find any info on the launch and landing mass, but no luck so far. Scaramouche33 (talk) 17:53, 12 November 2021 (UTC) When the sourced content is crap trivia (or more politely, "NASA PR") like The first astronauts of this NASA Astronaut Group 22 (nicknamed The Turtles) to fly to space, Raja Chari and Kayla Barron on SpaceX Crew-3 took a stuffed turtle as zero-g indicator, to pay a tribute to their astronaut group. Additionally, to include the other crew members on board, Matthias Maurer and Tom Marshburn, the turtle was named "Pfau", a German word meaning "Peacock" for Matthias Maurer who is German, and for Tom Marshburn who was part of NASA Astronaut Group 19 (nicknamed The Peacock). I didn't even bother checking for non-sourced content. User:? (powera, ?, ?) 17:07, 12 November 2021 (UTC) If you can improve the article, please do. Jehochman Talk 01:12, 13 November 2021 (UTC) I can't improve it. It is fully sourced and contains all the important information about the event. The problem is that there is so little important information to cover that the article also has to include unimportant information to not be a stub. Also, I agree that per policy this should be posted; it's not worth being brave to early-close the talk page discussion to remove this from ITNR immediately. User:? (powera, ?, ?) 16:59, 13 November 2021 (UTC) As I've said of ITNR before, it should be that any discussion about the rational for posting the broad categories of events should not be debated at ITNC on the basis there was consensus for the ITNR, but individual ITNR noms can be deemed to be so insignificant as exceptions from the category (as this appears to have qualified) as a type of IAR to the ITNR approach. This is of course in addition to the article quality aspects. ITNR is not a blood pact that we have to post every thing that fits. EG: about a year ago there was that Martian (?) sample collector that was first nom'd when it arrived in orbit (which was ITRN) but we decided to wait until news of the sample collection (the first of its sort) as the more notable event. That's the type of logic that should be behind judging ITNR. --Masem (t) 17:12, 13 November 2021 (UTC) The missing citations were fixed. Two uncited facts remained, and I just removed them because if we can't find a source after a full day of looking, that calls those facts into question. I will repost this in a moment. Feel free to continue discussion. Jehochman Talk 01:12, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Post-posting Comment – It's now the least interesting blurb in the box. – Sca (talk) 13:53, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Agree. Now would be a good time to recommend changing the ITNR criteria for human space flight. Jehochman Talk 15:36, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Post-posting Oppose more people being sent to space for little reason, aside from routine? Why is this “news”? 2A01:4C8:481:753A:912B:C8B8:F206:CFDF (talk) 14:21, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Post-posting oppose. Routine enough event that it'd never have been approved if it wasn't spaceflight-related. This is systemic bias at work. Jehochman, please reevaluate your determination of consensus here. {{u|Sdkb}}?talk 20:05, 14 November 2021 (UTC) It's still ITNR, so all Jehochman has to do is assess article quality, as you well know having just voted on the proposal to remove spaceflight entirely from ITNR. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 20:14, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Pull - Consensus on ITNR is trending heavily against news items of this sort. The right thing to do would be to remove this from ITN.--WaltCip-(talk) 21:41, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Nah, you can't retrospectively apply a trend. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 21:44, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Where there's a will.... – Sca (talk) 13:16, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Strikes me as churlish and petty now it's been there a few days. And after all, no actual readers have complained about its presence, just some who are lawyering around the edges of the process. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 13:19, 15 November 2021 (UTC) WP:NPA – Sca (talk) 13:28, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Um, you know the P stands for "personal", right? Oh dear. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 13:32, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Churlish and petty are words characterizing personal acts or traits, are they not?. – Sca (talk) 14:35, 15 November 2021 (UTC) I would oppose any pulling. The discussion on ITN/R about future postings should have no bearing on this one.-- Pawnkingthree (talk) 14:37, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose pulling. This was validly posted and should be left alone. If the next one is not under ITNR, fair enough(though I disagree with its total removal) but this one that was validly posted does not need to be removed. 331dot (talk) 13:21, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Support pulling nobody demonstrated this was important enough for ITN, they just used "it's ITNR" as justification. And the discussion has disproved that justification, as consensus is that it's not important. It was a nomination predicated on an untrue assertion. I would support doing the pull as a replacement when the next ITN blurb is added, so we don't have too little content on ITN. Joseph2302 (talk) 14:41, 15 November 2021 (UTC) That does not change that it was a valid posting when it was made. I don't think we should retroactively change policies. 331dot (talk) 14:42, 15 November 2021 (UTC) The discussion above is closed. Please do not modify it.

Admin instructions are here. ??Skip to suggestions In the news toolbox Error reports Nominations (Archives) Discussion General criteria Death criteria Recurring items Admin guide Image protection Current events portal v t e Shortcut WP:ITN/C This page provides a forum for editors to suggest items for inclusion on In the news (ITN), a protected template on the Main Page, as well as the forum for discussion of candidates. This is not the page to report errors in the ITN section on the Main Page—please go to the appropriate section at WP:ERRORS. Archives of past nominations can be found here. This candidates page is integrated with the daily pages of Portal:Current events. Under each daily section header below is the transcluded Portal:Current events items for that day (with a light green header). Each day's portal page is followed by a subsection for suggestions and discussion. A blurb is a one sentence summary of the news story. An alternate suggestion for the blurb is called an altblurb, and any more suggestions get labelled alt1, alt2, etc. A blurb needs at least one target article, highlighted in bold; reviewers check the quality of that article and whether it is updated, and whether reliable sources demonstrate the significance of the event. Other articles can also be linked. The Ongoing line is for regularly updated articles which cover events that remain in the news over a longer period of time. RD stands for the "recent deaths" line, and can include any living thing whose death was recently announced. In some cases, recent deaths may need additional explanation as provided by a blurb; this is decided by consensus.

Find the correct section below for the date of the event (not the date nominated). Do not add sections for new dates. These are automatically generated (at midnight UTC) by a bot; creating them manually breaks this process. Nominate the blurb for ITN inclusion under the "Suggestions" subheading for the date, emboldening the link in the blurb to the updated article. Use a level 4 header (====) when doing so. Preferably use the template {{ITN candidate}} to nominate the article related to the event in the news. Make sure that you include a reference from a verifiable, reliable secondary source. Press releases are not acceptable. The suggested blurb should be written in simple present tense. Adding an explanation why the event should be posted greatly increases the odds of posting. Please consider alerting editors to the nomination by adding the template {{ITN note}} to the corresponding article's talk page. Purge this page to update the cache There are criteria which guide the decision on whether or not to put a particular item on In the news, based largely on the extensiveness of the updated content and the perceived significance of the recent developments. These are listed at WP:ITN. Submissions that do not follow the guidelines at Wikipedia:In the news will not be placed onto the live template. Headers[edit] Items that have been posted or pulled from the main page are generally marked with (Posted) or (Pulled) in the item's subject so it is clear they are no longer active. Items can also be marked as (Ready) when the article is both updated and there seems to be a consensus to post. The posting admin, however, should always judge the update and the consensus to post themselves. If you find an entry that you don't feel is ready to post is marked (Ready), you should remove the mark in the header. Voicing an opinion on an item[edit] Format your comment to contain "support" or "oppose", and include a rationale for your choice. In particular, address the notability of the event, the quality of the article, and whether it has been updated. Please do not...[edit] add simple "support!" or "oppose!" votes without including your reasons. Similarly, curt replies such as "who?", "meh", or "duh!" are usually not helpful. Instead, explain the reasons why you think the item meets or does not meet the ITN inclusion criteria so a consensus can be reached. oppose an item because the event is only relating to a single country, or failing to relate to one. This applies to a high percentage of the content we post and is unproductive. accuse other editors of supporting, opposing or nominating due to a personal bias (such as ethnocentrism).

News source(s): Guardian Credits: Nominated by Blythwood (talk · give credit) Article updated Nominator's comments: Seems to be a forced disappearance. This is a bit unusual, but has been a major news story. Disappearance section seems solid but the rest of the article on her career is less well sourced. The person has disappeared without a trace, so while it cannot be verified that this person person has died or been imprisoned, her disappearance is in itself the notable event. I wonder if this could be treated as something like the equivalent of a recent death. Blythwood (talk) 22:39, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support - Article is in good condition and the news is prominent, exceptional, and of great public interest around the world. Jehochman Talk 22:45, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose and Wait - Article appear in news, but headlines on CBC, CNN, BBC are still focused on Rittenhouse Trial for now, although this may change. Otherwise, the blurb should describe whats happening now (the reactions), that she has not been publicly heard is not ITN as that is a few days old. 99.247.176.90 (talk) 23:06, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose - I fail to see how this is any more worthy of ITN than the Rittenhouse trial, which was also not worthy of ITN. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 23:10, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Please don't oppose because you think another nomination should be posted and you don't think this one is as worthy. Judge nomination on its own merit. The two are about completely different things. -- KTC (talk) 23:12, 19 November 2021 (UTC) I don't think either are worthy of being posted. --RockstoneSend me a message! 01:20, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support per Jehochman. However I'm not quite sure about the term "disappears" here, even if I personally think the Chinese state did exactly that. -- KTC (talk) 23:16, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support per Jehochman. -- Tavix (talk) 23:20, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support this is far more notable than "another white American kills black Americans" and regardless of the fact that headlines are currently obsessing over the US proclivity to allow kids to routinely assassinate people without any kind of criminal conviction, Peng's disappearance is genuinely newsworthy and encyclopedic. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 23:23, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Not that it matters to this nomination, but Rittenhouse's victims were white. GreatCaesarsGhost 00:04, 20 November 2021 (UTC) *cough cough* Rittenhouse's victims were white *cough cough* – John M Wolfson (talk • contribs) 00:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Who said he wasn't talking about Young Dolph's routine assassin? We don't know he wasn't white. We don't know if he had other black American victims. Memphis is all about unsolved mysteries! AGF. InedibleHulk (talk) 02:06, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose on quality The article needs a lot of work, as there are multiple sections with no inline citations.Pawnkingthree (talk) 23:42, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support While this might be unduly implicative of the Chinese state being connected, if RSs are making that connection this definitely belongs. – John M Wolfson (talk • contribs) 00:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose on quality I would support this if the article has some ref work done. There's sections that are unsourced. --TDKR Chicago 101 (talk) 00:34, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose this is newsworthy for sure but blurbing that someone "disappeared" after making an accusation seems like a WP:BLPCRIME issue to me. --LaserLegs (talk) 00:39, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Completely agree it's an awkward thing to summarise in a way that fits BLP while keeping it clear why the event is notable, I'd welcome suggestions for alternative phrasing. I realise this is a fairly limited action, but for that reason I deliberately didn't link to the person she accused in the proposed blurb. Blythwood (talk) 01:57, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose as per LaserLegs, there's something wrong about posting speculation that someone disappeared straight after they made accusations. With little reliable information, this seems like a BLP issue to post it. Joseph2302 (talk) 01:47, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Far too speculative, with overtones of anti-China sentiment, and with too many unknowns. Needs far more clarification before it is posted. And a guarantee that ITN will publish a full We Were Wrong! statement and retraction on the Main page when it is found out she has just eloped with her boyfriend or girlfriend, as the case may be. HiLo48 (talk) 01:55, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Clearly if China "disappeared" her, that would be a story, but this appears to be Western nations making a demand of China and there's no hard evidence she has been killed or imprisoned or the like. We don't post this type of speculative stories. --Masem (t) 02:16, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support Per wide coverage in RSes. Normchou?? 03:22, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose unless the incident has a separate article. Sun8908?Talk 07:38, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support — article looks decent enough for ITN standards by my eye, wide coverage in RSes. If the choice of "disappears" is undesirable, then "is reported missing" might be a potential alternative (posted as altblurb). [osunpokeh/talk/contributions] 08:41, 20 November 2021 (UTC) I think that suggests she was reported missing in the police report sense, not that Novak Djokovic described her as "a missing person" to reporters. Not a bad idea. Just a bit ambiguous. InedibleHulk (talk) 09:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Strong support, in the news, top page news in many countries. The issue is she has suddenly disappeared after accusing a senior cabinet minister of a serious crime, and the involved parties are public figures indept of this incident, so there is nothing wrong as long as it is sourced and not stated as truth. Peng's disappearance and the resulting sports diplomacy pressure and boycott threats are sufficient Bumbubookworm (talk) 12:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) I am adding sources to the career section Bumbubookworm (talk) 12:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – Per Masem, Joseph2302. Something that may have happened isn't blurbworthy, no matter how widely it's hyped. – Sca (talk) 13:05, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose per Masem, Sca. It could be the start of something noteworthy, or it could be nothing. We can post when it turns out to be something noteworthy if it does. Usedtobecool ?? 13:23, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support - Do we post news around here anymore?

A few WP:PROSELINE-issues, but not enough to downgrade the quality too much.

Elijahandskip (talk) 19:02, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Elijahandskip, #Please do not... oppose an item because the event is only relating to a single country, or failing to relate to one. This applies to a high percentage of the content we post and is unproductive. – Muboshgu (talk) 19:04, 19 November 2021 (UTC) (edit conflict):*See the instructions above "Please do not...oppose an item because the event is only relating to a single country, or failing to relate to one. This applies to a high percentage of the content we post and is unproductive." "International notability" is not a criteria for posting at ITN, nor has it ever been. --Jayron32 19:05, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Well my direct opinion is that it is not notable. My reasoning is the discussion that already took place on the 2021 talk page. I also have previous discussions months ago where things highly notable to one country aren’t included. Elijahandskip (talk) 19:11, 19 November 2021 (UTC) This is not a discussion of the page 2021. The criteria established for other parts of Wikipedia don't apply here. If you wish to change the criteria used for the ITN box, then start a discussion at WT:ITN. Votes without valid rationales are given little weight. It's fine if you have a useful rationale, but merely "I don't think it's notable enough" does not provide any useful guidance to admins when deciding consensus. I mean, you're allowed to say any silly thing you want, I suppose, but you can't expect anyone to take you seriously if it isn't valid. --Jayron32 19:18, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Well since you don’t like my reasoning, just let me say “no”. People have supported ITN’s in the past without giving a reason, so my “Oppose” in this case will not have a reason. Elijahandskip (talk) 19:22, 19 November 2021 (UTC) As I said, it's a free world. People do nonsensical things all of the time. --Jayron32 19:24, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Yep, I couldn’t agree more. In reality, my oppose on this comes more to combat American Wikipedia vs English Wikipedia. There is a essay on Wikipedia that I recently read that has that meaning. Not everything that happens in America is notable for Wikipedia/2021/ITN/Portal Current Events, etc….Elijahandskip (talk) 19:34, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose (at least on news of just the verdict). It was a highly watched case in the U.S., but it was clear early on to many legal experts that are crying foul on judicial behavior. It is very very likely to see an appeal and so this is not the end. This is not like the result from the very public George Floyd protests (which we posted and had ongoing about those, and the verdict). That said, there had been concerns there may be rioting following an acquittal , and while I'm not seeing any immediate news on that, a major riot (akin to the LA riots after King's verdict) would likely be the newsworthy factor here. --Masem (t) 19:05, 19 November 2021 (UTC) There literally cannot be any appeal of a not guilty verdict. This is a core principle of how double jeopardy is handled in American jurisprudence. A not guilty jury verdict is basically always final. See [1]. There are some exceedingly rare exceptions to this, but none of them would apply in this case. An ordinary jury verdict of "not guilty" like this one (even in a controversial trial) is treated as basically sacrosanct, and there can be no appeals by the government. --Jayron32 19:08, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Except for the calls for a mistrial that are being entered now. I know there's complexities with double jeopardy there, but that's still on the books and that itself can be a legal process. --Masem (t) 19:15, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Um, what? There were calls for a mistrial by Rittenhouse's defense team prior to the jury verdict coming back. Now that the verdict is in their client's favor, I doubt highly they will press forward with these requests. Indeed, articles such as this one note "The verdict also meant that Judge Bruce Schroeder did not have to rule on the defense's motions for a mistrial." --Jayron32 19:23, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose as above. If we had to have an American court psychodrama today, the better option from a world-historical perspective would probably be the acquittal of the purported killers of Malcolm X. —Brigade Piron (talk) 19:20, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose AGF, but this is such a small story in the grand scheme. GreatCaesarsGhost 19:23, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Wait. It is too early to tell what impact this will have. It could be a Rodney King-like result where acquittal of the accused leads to broad social unrest, or it could pass with a shrug. I expect that we will know within 24 hours.

CaptainEek Edits Ho Cap'n!? 20:32, 19 November 2021 (UTC) It is the most important US news event ongoing right now.

(Post) News source(s): AP, WSJ Credits: Nominated by Indefensible (talk · give credit) Updated by Dracophyllum (talk · give credit) and DiplomatTesterMan (talk · give credit) Nominator's comments: This article was previously in ongoing, now has a noteworthy update which should bring it towards conclusion. - Indefensible (talk) 06:50, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: One of the major farmers' unions behind the protests, Bharatiya Kisan Union, has promised to continue protesting till the laws are actually repealed (source). I wonder if we should put this blurb up now, or when Parliament repeals them and the farmers go home (don't have strong opinions either way, but I lean towards waiting). If we're going to put it up now, I've uploaded this screengrab of Modi's announcement from his CC-BY YouTube channel; we could use it. Btw Indefensible - Dracophyllum was the only updater, not DiplomatTesterMan. Kind regards, W. Tell DCCXLVI (talk to me!/c) 07:05, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Using the update to put back in ongoing instead of a final blurb would be fine too if preferable. And DiplomatTesterMan did more updates on the article before that, he still deserves some credit too I think. - Indefensible (talk) 07:12, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose because the article is not sufficiently updated. There is currently a 1 sentence mention in the lead of the repeal of the laws, and no mention of it, nor of any follow-on protests, anywhere in the body of the article. Before this can be posted, the latest developments would need to be added to the article appropriately. --Jayron32 12:18, 19 November 2021 (UTC) @Jayron32 Have you read the repeal section? Dracophyllum 20:10, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Your response is 8 hours after Jayron32's, Dracophyllum. The section may have not existed when Jayron commented. But then again, I am not going to take the time to check if it did exist at 12:18 PM UTC on 19 Nov 2021. Tube·of·Light 02:30, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: The announcement by itself has no legal value. Parliament has to repeal the laws, which it will probably do in the coming Winter Session. Also some farmer's unions are continuing protests until the laws are repealed and minimum support prices reconsidered. So it might be better to wait, but no strong opinion either way. --Jose Mathew (talk) 12:24, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Wait and see what the impact of this is.

This applies to a high percentage of the content we post and is unproductive." 331dot (talk) 23:11, 19 November 2021 (UTC) It's important to remember that 1/7 of the people on this planet are Indians. We don’t post a great deal of India related stories. 331dot (talk) 23:13, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Interestingly I didn't see the same PDM feedback from you above for another "country-centric" nomination from the worlds third most populous country. In fact, we do post many India-centric stories here, this one having festered in ongoing for nearly a year. --LaserLegs (talk) 23:36, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support. Invariably it is announcements that get more attention than the actual act, most of the time(we post elections when the result is known, not when the results are official/certified). If Modi renegs, that will likely be newsworthy itself. 331dot (talk) 23:16, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Weak oppose - as Wilhelm Tell DCCXLVI says, the BKU is still protesting. I would prefer waiting till the laws are actually repealed (and FWIW, these laws are being repealed just before the 2022 Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly elections and elections in some other states, which are crucial for Modi's political party). Tube·of·Light 02:30, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – On article quality – and as others have noted because the laws haven't taken effect. The article, at more than 10,000 words, is grossly overwritten, overblown and overweight – presumably by partisans who view the topic as a cause célèbre that calls for a crusade. – Sca (talk) 13:20, 20 November 2021 (UTC) November 2021 lunar eclipse[edit] Article: November 2021 lunar eclipse (talk · history · tag) Blurb: ?The longest partial lunar eclipse in 580 years occurs.

The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 21:41, 19 November 2021 (UTC) You're forgetting that lunar eclipses often presage globally cataclysmic events, such as permanent cancellation of The Boat Race, which I fear may now be in the offing for 2022. – Sca (talk) 13:30, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Of course, lunar eclipses and the Boat Race are entirely unrelated. And of course, there will be no "permanent cancellation of The Boat Race", that's total bollocks, but perhaps inline with your regular contributions. As you perhaps should know already, The Boat Race 2022 is scheduled for next year, and if COVID stymies it, one imagines it will simply be moved to the River Great Ouse once again. I'm unclear as to where you think that a lunar eclipse would be a portent for the permanent cancellation of an event which has been conducted since 1829, even before the Third Reich failed to play nicely. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 17:56, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Ease up, Ramblo, it was a joke. (And BTW, the Third Reich and this topic are entirely unrelated.) – Sca (talk) 18:26, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Yeah, and this topic and the Boat Race are completely unrelated. And it wasn't funny in any sense. So explain yourself. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 18:45, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support, this lunar eclipse has gotten significant news coverage.

The assassination itself, of course, would have been ITN-worthy, as would the convictions of the accused. To me, this is on the same level.

If I recall correctly, I think we did post the 2013 Alberta floods, for precedent. Connormah (talk) 22:39, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I guess "could be" is key here.

And the Kessler syndrome advances another notch. What we're mainly missing is a good picture but we might use something generic like this. Andrew?(talk) 12:56, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support in principle, as this is a significant event for the space industry (more so than Crew-3 that we already have on the template). However the article is pretty lightweight and could use some expansion. It also needs a source for the claim that Russia was responsible for the test - we can't claim something in the blurb that isn't cited in the article. I would also remove 'dangerous' from the blurb as that's quite a strong accusation.

Modest Genius talk 18:16, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support on the merits; the use of an anti-satellite weapon(even as a test) is rare and few countries possess such technology. Russia isn't denying it. 331dot (talk) 13:10, 16 November 2021 (UTC) @331dot: Yes, the use is rare and few countries possess such technology. Yet, I remember a similar test from India a couple of years ago was rejected as the technology "has been around for a while."

And other cn tags in article would need fixing. Though I agree, this is way more important/notable/covered in news sources than Crew-3.

Andrew?(talk) 13:22, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I oppose merging those blurbs - these are separate events. Modest Genius talk 14:07, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I also oppose merging- they're separate events, and this one is more important, so shouldn't be stuck on the end of some less important and newswirthy article that's only on the front page because it was alledgedly ITNR (even though that ITNR criteria was demonstrated to be unfit for purpose). And if this does reach front page, then DYK would no longer be eligible, but until that point, don't see a need to withdraw the DYK nom. Joseph2302 (talk) 14:30, 16 November 2021 (UTC) We could remove the Crew-3 blurb and replace it with this one when this is ready to go (assuming Crew-3 is still on ITN). Yeah, it doesn't get its "full time" there, but I agree that it doesn't make sense to merge, but having two ISS-related things could be seen as overwhelming the box. --Masem (t) 14:35, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – Fairly widely covered, but broader significance of a "threat" to the ISS isn't so apparent. – Sca (talk) 13:38, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Even a fleck of paint could seriously damage the ISS, one of the most expensive objects ever constructed. 331dot (talk) 11:14, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support in principle. This is very significant news and an interesting story of high encyclopedic value.--Kiril Simeonovski (talk) 13:41, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support in principle per above, just needs better fleshing out of the article. --Masem (t) 13:53, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – Upon reflection, it seems to be a serious threat all right, but ... can we post something that hasn't had a tangible effect ... yet? – Sca (talk) 14:11, 16 November 2021 (UTC) PS: My question is, did Putin authorize this stupid 'test' – or was it just an act of heedless military apparatchiks down in the bureaucracy? (Russia is an oligarchy that has a country – a country that has an enormous military.) – Sca (talk) 14:19, 16 November 2021 (UTC) The way I'm reading it, the story is more that Russia has appeared to have violated a treaty related to space-bound weapons, in addition to this being a story of interest to space exploration (the potential of damage to the ISS that forced the crew to shelter for at least two orbits as it passed through the debris field). --Masem (t) 14:17, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Reasonable enough. However, the threat to human lives (including two Russians!) seems more compelling in terms of reader interest. – Sca (talk) 14:22, 16 November 2021 (UTC) From our article on the Outer Space Treaty: "Although it forbids establishing military bases, testing weapons and conducting military maneuvers on celestial bodies, the treaty does not expressly ban all military activities in space, nor the establishment of military space forces or the placement of conventional weapons in space". Testing an anti-satellite weapon on your own target is not against any treaty, just regarded as irresponsible. Note that the US, China and India have all conducted similar tests with no legal repercussions or UN censure. Modest Genius talk 15:09, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose no longer fresh, not really in the news, rolled off a while ago and probably better suited for DYK. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 16:11, 16 November 2021 (UTC) What's your time frame for "no longer fresh"? The BBC article is only 12 hours old and the event itself occurred yesterday. It's certainly a newer event than anything currently in the ITN box... --Jayron32 16:16, 16 November 2021 (UTC) (edit conflict) The BBC published two more articles about this story in just the last hour [8] [9]. That seems pretty fresh. Modest Genius talk 16:19, 16 November 2021 (UTC) It happened yesterday, and is very much still in the news. Much more so than the posted blurbs, such as the NYC Marathon on 7 November for example. Joseph2302 (talk) 16:20, 16 November 2021 (UTC) OH sure, you can dig into websites and find more analysis, but it's not headline news and hasn't been for most of the day now. Even the article makes it clear that the "main event" has passed. Biggest headlines in the UK are now that Johnson is proposing to prevent MPs from getting paid consultancy jobs. This story is no longer even on the BBC News homepage. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 16:24, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support Article is short, but sufficient; it seems to have developed some since the earlier notes. Topic is being covered by reliable news sources. --Jayron32 16:17, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose ... for now. Article text comprises 340 words, of which 115 are background, leaving a mere 230 words about the current threat. IMO, too thin for MP promotion. Second, we shouldn't blurb something that hasn't had an impact (yet). – Sca (talk) 17:03, 16 November 2021 (UTC) PS: Given that the current situation could continue for quite some time, perhaps after a bit we should consider posting this directly to Ongoing. – Sca (talk) 17:10, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Whatever political fallout there has been is pretty much so far just a short but important burst (for blurb posting), but there's no sign this is going to escalate into something further, in comparison to the nuclear submarine sale a few months back. --Masem (t) 19:50, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Wait is there a real danger debris hits other satellites soon, or is this just "an abundance of caution"? Will there be significant geo-political ramifications from the test? Until one of those is "yes", I think we should wait. User:? (powera, ?, ?) 19:52, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Everywhere is at risk for disaster, but this info is nothing like disaster actually happening. Political story, and involving two countries who always bicker. Could change if the ISS is destroyed or something stronger than words breaks out. InedibleHulk (talk) 20:46, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Is this an RD nom for the destruction of Kosmos 1408? If so, its "career section" needs an expansion to describe how it was used while still in orbit and operational.--PFHLai (talk) 23:08, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Questionable significance as far as potential impacts, especially given at the moment it is just predictive. I would assume that the test itself is not sufficient for ITN, so I'm on the "Oppose" side here. DarkSide830 (talk) 00:01, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support even if nothing happens to the ISS, ASAT weapon tests don't happen every day, or even every year. Banedon (talk) 03:44, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support Certainly magnitudes more important than the multitude of launches posted every now and then on ITN. Gotitbro (talk) 07:09, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support significant, made the news and the article Kosmos 1408 is short but adequate. Given the military nature of this satellite and its destruction, we can't expect to know that many details. Of the proposed blurbs, only alt 1 is good. --LukeSurl t c 10:02, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support in principle this is a significant story BUT it simply cannot be posted with a blurb of this quality. Its language is misleading and makes it sound as if a functional satellite was attacked, but rather a defunct satellite was destroyed as part of a weapons test... slightly different. Possibly also include the name of the missile system, if known, and replace "Russia" with the actual agency overseeing the test. JMonkey2006 (talk) 11:10, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Feel free to propose a different blurb. Or we could simply add 'defunct' before the name of the satellite. Modest Genius talk 11:38, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – Absent from main RS sites on Wednesday; no longer in the news. Seems a minor issue without tangible effects. Neither target article is really about this event. – Sca (talk) 12:42, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support in principle per JMonkey. Fakescientist8000 (talk) 13:54, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support. The Kessler syndrome may have been triggered: "The Kessler syndrome is troublesome because of the domino effect and feedback runaway wherein impacts between objects of sizable mass spall off debris from the force of the collision. The fragments can then hit other objects, producing even more space debris: if a large enough collision or explosion were to occur, such as between a space station and a defunct satellite, or as the result of hostile actions in space, then the resulting debris cascade could make prospects for long-term viability of satellites in particular low Earth orbits extremely low." Count Iblis (talk) 14:52, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support - Russia is weaponizing space. Whether or not they were the first to do it - and presumably they weren't - this is an indication of a change in global affairs when it comes to outer space.--WaltCip-(talk) 16:16, 17 November 2021 (UTC) If you didn't know (see anti-satellite weapon), the first ASAT test was in 1959, and was conducted by the US. Banedon (talk) 02:06, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Comment any admins around here to post this? I oppose its inclusion as it's already stale in my opinion, but there's a pretty clear consensus here and the longer it's left unposted, the staler it becomes....

As we have posted the winner in the previous elections, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:In_the_news/Candidates/July_2021#(Posted)_Bulgarian_parliamentary_election.

The coalition has two leaders, not just Petkov. Do we want to wait till a government is formed? --PFHLai (talk) 12:01, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I guess yeah, he deserves one too, but Petkov is the primary focus here as he is the one seeking to become prime minister (per https://www.euronews.com/2021/11/14/bulgarian-elections-newly-formed-pp-party-neck-and-neck-with-right-wing-gerb-party). The truth is we don't even know yet if they will be successful forming a goverment, but we posted both the Czech party SPOLU and the last Bulgarian election when ITN won the most seats as the election itself is ITNR, so going by that this nomination/blurb should be suitable to make it out to the front page.BastianMAT (talk) 12:17, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support Article is in great shape. I think the easiest way to solve what PFHLai exposes is to put in the blurb that Petkov is the "co-leader", thus making it understood that he is not the only one leading the coalition. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 12:42, 16 November 2021 (UTC) How about not mentioning either co-leaders in the blurb?

Half of the seats in the lower chamber and 1/3 of the upper chamber are up for election and our article defines general elections as "elections in which all or most members of a political body are chosen." Scaramouche33 (talk) 16:16, 15 November 2021 (UTC) I half-wondered if such "mid-term" elections were covered by ITNR. If they are, perhaps that should also be explicitly noted at ITNR. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 16:19, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Yeah, mid terms elections are part of it, it is notable too as the ruling party have lost their majority. Here is the US one that was also posted. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:In_the_news/Candidates/November_2018#(Posted)_2018_US_Midterm_Elections.BastianMAT (talk) 16:28, 15 November 2021 (UTC) But that was mainly because it involved "all or most members of a political body are chosen". This doesn't appear to be the case here. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 16:44, 15 November 2021 (UTC) It depends on how you see on it. The mid term senate elections in US only feature 34 members up running for election. In Argentina it was half of the congress and enough for an significant change in both political bodies (ruling party losing control of both the house and the senate).BastianMAT (talk) 16:53, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Well it doesn't matter what happened in the US, how does this meet the requirements at ITNR? The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 16:59, 15 November 2021 (UTC) From what I understand, in the US midterms all House seats+1/3 of Senate seats were up for election so that would be considered as "most members of an electoral body" but here it's only half. Does that still count as general elections? If so it's ITN/R, if not who knows. Scaramouche33 (talk) 17:14, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Yeah I agree, it is arguable for both sides. At least based on this, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midterm_election, Argentina[1] (legislative and local election) falls under the heading General elections (which makes it ITNR) alongside the United States (legislative and local election) which was posted.BastianMAT (talk) 17:17, 15 November 2021 (UTC) I'm not sure it is arguable here, it doesn't meet the definition in ITNR and it's a mid-term, not a general election by any normal definition (despite what "Wikipedia" might say). The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 17:30, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – First four grafs back into the results and seem needlessly complex. – Sca (talk) 17:19, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Comment the table in the infobox violates MOS:COLHEAD by having column headers in the middle of the table.

I believe it's the first bombing in England since 2017 Manchester Arena one, and caused the UK terror threat level to be increased. Article itself is good enough quality. Joseph2302 (talk) 17:23, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support given that they have assigned terrorist motives to this now.

The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 18:04, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose This was a minor terrorist attack that caused only one casualty. Now we are not concerned about the number of victims? Certainly "is in the news", but I don't think it has the same relevance as other terrorist incidents that have occurred that have not been approved to be on Main Page. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 18:33, 16 November 2021 (UTC) The perpetrator was killed and the taxi driver was hospitalised. Martinevans123 (talk) 18:40, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. Failed attack which caused one injury and killed the attacker. It's not clear what the target was or who it was supposed to terrorise. If this hadn't been declared a terrorist incident it would be minor local news. I encourage the existing DYK nom instead. Modest Genius talk 19:02, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Regardless of terrorism tag, I suspect this would have been national news. But of course, we will never know. The fact is it is big national news. Martinevans123 (talk) 19:07, 16 November 2021 (UTC) But it was declared a terrorist attack, which adds notability to the incident. Jbvann05 20:32, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Not really, it just grants the police additional powers and generates more headlines. The actual event doesn't become any worse. Modest Genius talk 13:18, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Support alt Notable, now declared a terrorist incident, article in decent shape.  Spy-cicle?  Talk? 19:15, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support - Terrorism need not have a high death count in order to be notable and newsworthy; we have posted terrorist incidents on ITN that have had a death toll of zero.--WaltCip-(talk) 20:04, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Comment I find it very interesting how many of those who support this nomination refused to publish the terrorist attack in Auckland in September, whose consequences were almost the same as in this case. Any clarification? _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 20:58, 16 November 2021 (UTC) What do you mean "refused to publish"? They didn't !vote there. Apart from Modest Genius, who is opposed here also? Martinevans123 (talk) 21:05, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you for your answer because clearly I've realized that I have not expressed myself well. I mean that at the time, the reason why I've opposed was the same used by other users (who have not participated in this debate, except Modest Genius) to not support the cited nomination in September. That is why I am frankly surprised. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 21:29, 16 November 2021 (UTC) BLP Caution One suspect is dead, but four others are arrested in connection; might want to attribute this "attempted terrorist bombing" instead of stating it as a fact Wikipedia knows (a "declaration" from police is still an allegation). InedibleHulk (talk) 21:37, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Counter Terrorism Police Caution: all four have been released: [10]. Martinevans123 (talk) 21:50, 16 November 2021 (UTC) OK, nevermind then. Can't go wrong speaking ill of the dead. At least by Wikipedian norms. InedibleHulk (talk) 22:10, 16 November 2021 (UTC) No need to get personal, if you don't mind. Norman Butkiss 123 (talk) 22:47, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. I will admit to perhaps being more jaded to bomb stories than some other nationalities may be, but even with that notwithstanding, I don't believe we'd be considering an attack which killed no victims and injured one if it took place elsewhere (we recently didn't post, for example, an attack that targeted but didn't kill a head of state). That isn't necessarily to say there's any deliberate bias here but it's important to remember that England has a well-developed media sphere and any regional story will have a lot of domestic coverage, but we are not necessarily beholden to repeat their biases. For reference, even the BBC have displaced this story in favour of the latest update in a racism dispute in county cricket. ??????? ? 21:46, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support major incident, leading news story, article decent. Polyamorph (talk) 21:48, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support (Alt 2). UK terror threat level raised from substantial to severe pushes it over the edge. Martinevans123 (talk) 23:15, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose As suicide in Britain goes, it was unusually public and explosive, but lacks too much death and destruction next to the general public suicide bombings (a similar story from Strathroy-Caradoc#History isn't even an article, for context). InedibleHulk (talk) 23:19, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose -- it's already stopped being news, it seems. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 02:50, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Questionable significance since nothing major [fortunately] did not take place. Gotitbro (talk) 07:12, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose as the investigation has not been completed and it has not been confirmed yet whether it was terrorism, whether the detonation was intentional or accidental, or who the intended victim or victims might to have been. The current article contains too much opinion, innuendo, and speculation portrayed as fact. -- DeFacto (talk). 07:38, 17 November 2021 (UTC) By all means mark any "opinion, innuendo, and speculation portrayed as fact" and/or take to the talk page. Opinion is generally permitted if it's clearly attributed? Thanks. Martinevans123 (talk) 11:21, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Very Strong Oppose Per WP:Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, we are supposed to be an encyclopedia, and we are NOT supposed to be a dangerous free publicity machine for every murderous suicidal nutter, still less for every would-be terrorist and every terrorist organisation. So a terrorist incident should be truly exceptional and notable before appearing on our front page, all the more so as it is often liable to remain there giving dangerous free publicity (and thus in practice encouragement) to terrorists and other murderous nutters long after it has disappeared from the front pages of other mainstream Western news outlets (as many terrorists probably already realize, even if many editors around here seemingly don't). There is NOTHING in this incident that gives it the required exceptionality and notability to justify the danger this poses to innocent people, as well as the damage it might (rightly in my view) do to our reputation. Tlhslobus (talk) 18:15, 17 November 2021 (UTC) See WP:RIGHTGREATWRONGS. Your diatribe is interesting, but nothing to do with ITNC, otherwise we'd never publish another mass shooting in the US ever again. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 18:27, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose No lasting effect plus terrible disjointed article means it's a No from me, Bob. Black Kite (talk) 18:23, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose The story stopped trending yesterday, and the death/injury toll is very low (luckily). If attacks of this kind were rare in the UK I would be willing to overlook these factors, but (unfortunately) there's been a seemingly-steady uptick in the last couple of years, so there's nothing about this that makes it stand out. Mount Patagonia (talk) 18:27, 17 November 2021 (UTC) But the satellite blow-up stopped trending 36 hours ago and no-one died. Terror attacks where bombs are ignited on Remembrance Day are few and far between, I'm sure you can point me to the last time that happened, right? The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 18:29, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I was referencing upticks in UK-based terror attacks in general, not ones falling on Rememberance Day. If terror attacks that fell on special occasions were automatic shoe-ins, then last year's Christmas bombing in Nashville would have been posted, but it wasn't for the same reasons I'm opposing posting this story. For the Russian satellite, take it up with the people for voted for it because I had no involvement in that decision. Mount Patagonia (talk) 22:06, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Indeed, terror attacks often happen on supposedly significant days or dates (sometimes perhaps coincidentally, sometimes perhaps as part of an attempt to increase the attack's psychological impact, or perhaps sometimes for quasi-religious reasons). Not only do we not use this as an excuse to put it into ITN, we sometimes leave it out of the article as well. For instance it was 5 years before Wikipedia mentioned that the Bataclan attacks occurred on Friday the 13th and there is still no link from it to the article about the superstition, presumably because RS don't mention such a link (perhaps to avoid making vulnerable people more fearful or otherwise psychologically distressed or harmed whenever 'significant' dates approach). Tlhslobus (talk) 15:33, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Comment we don't need to name the perp in any of the blurbs. That's totally undue. Get a grip people. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 18:30, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I've been bold and removed the name of the perp. We don't need that, even if this isn't posted, anywhere near this encyclopedia. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 20:17, 17 November 2021 (UTC) The name of the perpetrator is encyclopedic and should be in the article; but I agree that it should not be posted in ITN regardless. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 00:14, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose No victims and unclear / unorganised motive. Belugsump (talk) 03:44, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – Limited significance. No longer in the news. – Sca (talk) 13:06, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose.

Joseph2302 (talk) 14:36, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Agree. It's also not compliant with MOS:ACCESS since it contains nested tables. This should be fixed before it's posted on the main page.  — Amakuru (talk) 17:17, 15 November 2021 (UTC) MOS:DTAB is a laudable goal, but not one of the WP:ITNCRIT. It's probably moot though, as no improvements to the article have been made in the last 3 days. Modest Genius talk 11:36, 17 November 2021 (UTC) While articles on topics such as sporting events and economics lend themselves to tables of numbers, updates must be at least in part written in prose to qualify for ITN consideration. That isn't the case here, as the section in question is using ugly nested tables rather than prose (like I suggested doing days ago).

Some activists are critical of the agreement, as it leaves unresolved the question of how much and how quickly each nation should cut its carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions over the next decade, and it still leaves many developing countries short of the funds that they would need in order to cope with increasing weather disasters.

This agreement is the same, if not more important for global climate action. JMonkey2006 (talk) 01:45, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Comment Glasgow Climate Pact obviously isn't remotely close to being front-page quality, and 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference doesn't say what happened either. Once this is updated, I will probably support on importance. User:? (powera, ?, ?) 02:52, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose there's at least enough article to vote. Article still has issues; the "Pledges" section is describing things agreed at the conference that don't appear to be specifically part of the "Glasgow Climate Pact", and the link to Wikisource isn't broken. As far as importance ... we posted the conference once, and the biggest news is that there are plans to decrease coal usage ... this isn't worth posting again. User:? (powera, ?, ?) 01:06, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Support – in principle ... pending updating and succinct revision of 2021 climate conference article. It would be very odd not to blurb this universally covered confab, now over. – Sca (talk) 13:44, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Comment That we already posted the COP26 earlier, and that the general impression of the Glasgow Pact that I get from sources is that it is far less as a milestone compared to the Paris Agreements (since it basically affirms commitment to them) makes me wonder if this is really that significant to post a second time. --Masem (t) 14:23, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Au contraire. Despite disappointments, 'world leaders' said to "broadly welcome" the climate deal, which "for the first time targeted fossil fuels." At least they did something. Prominently covered by every major RS site. – Sca (talk) 15:28, 14 November 2021 (UTC) That sentence wasn't over. First time targeting fossil fuels "as the key driver of global warming". Whatever that means. InedibleHulk (talk) 16:29, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Resistance is futile. "In asking nations to set tougher targets by next year for cutting climate-warming emissions, the agreement effectively acknowledged that commitments were still inadequate. National pledges currently have the world on track for about 2.4C of warming." The article quality outlook is also dire. InedibleHulk (talk) 16:38, 14 November 2021 (UTC) We're not here to judge the work of the conferees. We're here to take note a very heavily covered, extended international conference that was widely and prominently covered. Do I think the so-called climate pact will solve global warming? No (although it might be a move in the right direction). What you or I think of it doesn't matter. What matters is, it was/is very much in the news, and the topic is hugely significant. – Sca (talk) 17:32, 14 November 2021 (UTC) The work of the conferees is the topic. If the news reports the commitments made therein as inadequate, it's not hugely significant in the broader and more newsworthy topic area of global warming prevention. This running conference is just in the news because it was long expected to end today somehow. InedibleHulk (talk) 17:45, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Nope. Even if they had done nothing it would be significant for reasons outlined above. – Sca (talk) 17:49, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I respectfully disagree. InedibleHulk (talk) 17:54, 14 November 2021 (UTC) If we hadn't posted the COP26 thing earlier, I would have been fine with posting this as an ending point as generally the overall conference was in the news. But given that we already did and this new piece is not a major piece of environmental commitment compared to the Paris Agreement, double posting this is just not appropriate. --Masem (t) 22:25, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose article is short and unsourced in places. Also, given the Paris Agreement exists, it seems the impact of this is minimal (limited only to reducing coal). Joseph2302 (talk) 09:00, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Support on the merits; it's unusual for 197 countries to agree to any single document, even if largely a statement of principles or desires. But agree it is not yet suitable for posting. 331dot (talk) 10:02, 15 November 2021 (UTC) It should be pointed out that not all 190-some signing countries are committed to the same parts of the document: for example, only 40+ are on board with coal reduction. Hence why this is far less impactful as the Paris Agreements. --Masem (t) 13:41, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Support original blurb in principle, oppose on quality. The pact is a bit of a damp squib, far less ambitious than expected or required. However we're not here to judge the outcome, just whether it meets the ITN criteria. This is certainly in the news, at or near the top of every quality media outlet. However the pact article is barely a start class and needs some major TLC before being postable. I considered bolding the COP26 article again, but its 'outcomes' section is in even worse state. Modest Genius talk 12:20, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – Conspicuous omission from ITN blurb box. – Sca (talk) 13:05, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Sca As several users have noted, there are quality issues preventing posting. If you want to see it posted, you are welcome to fix those issues. 331dot (talk) 13:43, 15 November 2021 (UTC) (edit conflict) Sca In what sense? The article is not good enough for front page quality (as ITN isn't OTD, which likes to post poorly sourced articles), and there's no consensus to post it anyway, as they don't seem to have all agreed anything (as different countries signed different agreements). If you want news pushed out as fast as possible, use a news website. Joseph2302 (talk) 13:44, 15 November 2021 (UTC) "likes"? Oh, come on. Be nice to our colleagues and neighbours on MainPage. They are rather understaffed there in SA/OTD. It's more like "less than ideal stuff sneaking through too often". But I'm off-topic... --PFHLai (talk) 14:32, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose - given that we already posted the COP26 once, and the headline agreement doesn't appear to be a huge step forward, I don't see a need to post it again. Maybe next time we can hold off posting the opening of such events so that we can capture a one-time interesting headline for readers.  — Amakuru (talk) 22:09, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – Getting stale. – Sca (talk) 15:26, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – Stale. Suggest close. – Sca (talk) 13:11, 19 November 2021 (UTC) References[edit] Nominators often include links to external websites and other references in discussions on this page. It is usually best to provide such links using the inline URL syntax [http://example.com] rather than using <ref></ref> tags, because that keeps all the relevant information in the same place as the nomination without having to jump to this section, and facilitates the archiving process.

Please read the guidelines. Admin instructions are here. ??Skip to suggestions In the news toolbox Error reports Nominations (Archives) Discussion General criteria Death criteria Recurring items Admin guide Image protection Current events portal v t e Shortcut WP:ITN/C This page provides a forum for editors to suggest items for inclusion on In the news (ITN), a protected template on the Main Page, as well as the forum for discussion of candidates. This is not the page to report errors in the ITN section on the Main Page—please go to the appropriate section at WP:ERRORS. Archives of past nominations can be found here. This candidates page is integrated with the daily pages of Portal:Current events. Under each daily section header below is the transcluded Portal:Current events items for that day (with a light green header). Each day's portal page is followed by a subsection for suggestions and discussion. A blurb is a one sentence summary of the news story. An alternate suggestion for the blurb is called an altblurb, and any more suggestions get labelled alt1, alt2, etc. A blurb needs at least one target article, highlighted in bold; reviewers check the quality of that article and whether it is updated, and whether reliable sources demonstrate the significance of the event. Other articles can also be linked. The Ongoing line is for regularly updated articles which cover events that remain in the news over a longer period of time. RD stands for the "recent deaths" line, and can include any living thing whose death was recently announced. In some cases, recent deaths may need additional explanation as provided by a blurb; this is decided by consensus.

Find the correct section below for the date of the event (not the date nominated). Do not add sections for new dates. These are automatically generated (at midnight UTC) by a bot; creating them manually breaks this process. Nominate the blurb for ITN inclusion under the "Suggestions" subheading for the date, emboldening the link in the blurb to the updated article. Use a level 4 header (====) when doing so. Preferably use the template {{ITN candidate}} to nominate the article related to the event in the news. Make sure that you include a reference from a verifiable, reliable secondary source. Press releases are not acceptable. The suggested blurb should be written in simple present tense. Adding an explanation why the event should be posted greatly increases the odds of posting. Please consider alerting editors to the nomination by adding the template {{ITN note}} to the corresponding article's talk page. Purge this page to update the cache There are criteria which guide the decision on whether or not to put a particular item on In the news, based largely on the extensiveness of the updated content and the perceived significance of the recent developments. These are listed at WP:ITN. Submissions that do not follow the guidelines at Wikipedia:In the news will not be placed onto the live template. Headers[edit] Items that have been posted or pulled from the main page are generally marked with (Posted) or (Pulled) in the item's subject so it is clear they are no longer active. Items can also be marked as (Ready) when the article is both updated and there seems to be a consensus to post. The posting admin, however, should always judge the update and the consensus to post themselves. If you find an entry that you don't feel is ready to post is marked (Ready), you should remove the mark in the header. Voicing an opinion on an item[edit] Format your comment to contain "support" or "oppose", and include a rationale for your choice. In particular, address the notability of the event, the quality of the article, and whether it has been updated. Please do not...[edit] add simple "support!" or "oppose!" votes without including your reasons. Similarly, curt replies such as "who?", "meh", or "duh!" are usually not helpful. Instead, explain the reasons why you think the item meets or does not meet the ITN inclusion criteria so a consensus can be reached. oppose an item because the event is only relating to a single country, or failing to relate to one. This applies to a high percentage of the content we post and is unproductive. accuse other editors of supporting, opposing or nominating due to a personal bias (such as ethnocentrism). Conflicts of interest are not handled at ITN. comment on a story without first reading the relevant article(s). oppose a recurring item here because you disagree with the recurring items criteria. The criteria can be discussed at the relevant talk page.

News source(s): Guardian Credits: Nominated by Blythwood (talk · give credit) Article updated Nominator's comments: Seems to be a forced disappearance. This is a bit unusual, but has been a major news story. Disappearance section seems solid but the rest of the article on her career is less well sourced. The person has disappeared without a trace, so while it cannot be verified that this person person has died or been imprisoned, her disappearance is in itself the notable event. I wonder if this could be treated as something like the equivalent of a recent death. Blythwood (talk) 22:39, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support - Article is in good condition and the news is prominent, exceptional, and of great public interest around the world. Jehochman Talk 22:45, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose and Wait - Article appear in news, but headlines on CBC, CNN, BBC are still focused on Rittenhouse Trial for now, although this may change. Otherwise, the blurb should describe whats happening now (the reactions), that she has not been publicly heard is not ITN as that is a few days old. 99.247.176.90 (talk) 23:06, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose - I fail to see how this is any more worthy of ITN than the Rittenhouse trial, which was also not worthy of ITN. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 23:10, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Please don't oppose because you think another nomination should be posted and you don't think this one is as worthy. Judge nomination on its own merit. The two are about completely different things. -- KTC (talk) 23:12, 19 November 2021 (UTC) I don't think either are worthy of being posted. --RockstoneSend me a message! 01:20, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support per Jehochman. However I'm not quite sure about the term "disappears" here, even if I personally think the Chinese state did exactly that. -- KTC (talk) 23:16, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support per Jehochman. -- Tavix (talk) 23:20, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support this is far more notable than "another white American kills black Americans" and regardless of the fact that headlines are currently obsessing over the US proclivity to allow kids to routinely assassinate people without any kind of criminal conviction, Peng's disappearance is genuinely newsworthy and encyclopedic. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 23:23, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Not that it matters to this nomination, but Rittenhouse's victims were white. GreatCaesarsGhost 00:04, 20 November 2021 (UTC) *cough cough* Rittenhouse's victims were white *cough cough* – John M Wolfson (talk • contribs) 00:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Who said he wasn't talking about Young Dolph's routine assassin? We don't know he wasn't white. We don't know if he had other black American victims. Memphis is all about unsolved mysteries! AGF. InedibleHulk (talk) 02:06, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose on quality The article needs a lot of work, as there are multiple sections with no inline citations.Pawnkingthree (talk) 23:42, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support While this might be unduly implicative of the Chinese state being connected, if RSs are making that connection this definitely belongs. – John M Wolfson (talk • contribs) 00:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose on quality I would support this if the article has some ref work done. There's sections that are unsourced. --TDKR Chicago 101 (talk) 00:34, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose this is newsworthy for sure but blurbing that someone "disappeared" after making an accusation seems like a WP:BLPCRIME issue to me. --LaserLegs (talk) 00:39, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Completely agree it's an awkward thing to summarise in a way that fits BLP while keeping it clear why the event is notable, I'd welcome suggestions for alternative phrasing. I realise this is a fairly limited action, but for that reason I deliberately didn't link to the person she accused in the proposed blurb. Blythwood (talk) 01:57, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose as per LaserLegs, there's something wrong about posting speculation that someone disappeared straight after they made accusations. With little reliable information, this seems like a BLP issue to post it. Joseph2302 (talk) 01:47, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Far too speculative, with overtones of anti-China sentiment, and with too many unknowns. Needs far more clarification before it is posted. And a guarantee that ITN will publish a full We Were Wrong! statement and retraction on the Main page when it is found out she has just eloped with her boyfriend or girlfriend, as the case may be. HiLo48 (talk) 01:55, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Clearly if China "disappeared" her, that would be a story, but this appears to be Western nations making a demand of China and there's no hard evidence she has been killed or imprisoned or the like. We don't post this type of speculative stories. --Masem (t) 02:16, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support Per wide coverage in RSes. Normchou?? 03:22, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose unless the incident has a separate article. Sun8908?Talk 07:38, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support — article looks decent enough for ITN standards by my eye, wide coverage in RSes. If the choice of "disappears" is undesirable, then "is reported missing" might be a potential alternative (posted as altblurb). [osunpokeh/talk/contributions] 08:41, 20 November 2021 (UTC) I think that suggests she was reported missing in the police report sense, not that Novak Djokovic described her as "a missing person" to reporters. Not a bad idea. Just a bit ambiguous. InedibleHulk (talk) 09:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Strong support, in the news, top page news in many countries. The issue is she has suddenly disappeared after accusing a senior cabinet minister of a serious crime, and the involved parties are public figures indept of this incident, so there is nothing wrong as long as it is sourced and not stated as truth.

This applies to a high percentage of the content we post and is unproductive." "International notability" is not a criteria for posting at ITN, nor has it ever been. --Jayron32 19:05, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Well my direct opinion is that it is not notable. My reasoning is the discussion that already took place on the 2021 talk page. I also have previous discussions months ago where things highly notable to one country aren’t included. Elijahandskip (talk) 19:11, 19 November 2021 (UTC) This is not a discussion of the page 2021. The criteria established for other parts of Wikipedia don't apply here. If you wish to change the criteria used for the ITN box, then start a discussion at WT:ITN. Votes without valid rationales are given little weight. It's fine if you have a useful rationale, but merely "I don't think it's notable enough" does not provide any useful guidance to admins when deciding consensus. I mean, you're allowed to say any silly thing you want, I suppose, but you can't expect anyone to take you seriously if it isn't valid. --Jayron32 19:18, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Well since you don’t like my reasoning, just let me say “no”. People have supported ITN’s in the past without giving a reason, so my “Oppose” in this case will not have a reason. Elijahandskip (talk) 19:22, 19 November 2021 (UTC) As I said, it's a free world. People do nonsensical things all of the time. --Jayron32 19:24, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Yep, I couldn’t agree more. In reality, my oppose on this comes more to combat American Wikipedia vs English Wikipedia. There is a essay on Wikipedia that I recently read that has that meaning. Not everything that happens in America is notable for Wikipedia/2021/ITN/Portal Current Events, etc….Elijahandskip (talk) 19:34, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose (at least on news of just the verdict). It was a highly watched case in the U.S., but it was clear early on to many legal experts that are crying foul on judicial behavior. It is very very likely to see an appeal and so this is not the end. This is not like the result from the very public George Floyd protests (which we posted and had ongoing about those, and the verdict). That said, there had been concerns there may be rioting following an acquittal , and while I'm not seeing any immediate news on that, a major riot (akin to the LA riots after King's verdict) would likely be the newsworthy factor here. --Masem (t) 19:05, 19 November 2021 (UTC) There literally cannot be any appeal of a not guilty verdict. This is a core principle of how double jeopardy is handled in American jurisprudence. A not guilty jury verdict is basically always final. See [1]. There are some exceedingly rare exceptions to this, but none of them would apply in this case. An ordinary jury verdict of "not guilty" like this one (even in a controversial trial) is treated as basically sacrosanct, and there can be no appeals by the government. --Jayron32 19:08, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Except for the calls for a mistrial that are being entered now. I know there's complexities with double jeopardy there, but that's still on the books and that itself can be a legal process. --Masem (t) 19:15, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Um, what? There were calls for a mistrial by Rittenhouse's defense team prior to the jury verdict coming back. Now that the verdict is in their client's favor, I doubt highly they will press forward with these requests. Indeed, articles such as this one note "The verdict also meant that Judge Bruce Schroeder did not have to rule on the defense's motions for a mistrial." --Jayron32 19:23, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose as above. If we had to have an American court psychodrama today, the better option from a world-historical perspective would probably be the acquittal of the purported killers of Malcolm X. —Brigade Piron (talk) 19:20, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose AGF, but this is such a small story in the grand scheme. GreatCaesarsGhost 19:23, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Wait. It is too early to tell what impact this will have. It could be a Rodney King-like result where acquittal of the accused leads to broad social unrest, or it could pass with a shrug. I expect that we will know within 24 hours.

I wonder if we should put this blurb up now, or when Parliament repeals them and the farmers go home (don't have strong opinions either way, but I lean towards waiting). If we're going to put it up now, I've uploaded this screengrab of Modi's announcement from his CC-BY YouTube channel; we could use it. Btw Indefensible - Dracophyllum was the only updater, not DiplomatTesterMan. Kind regards, W. Tell DCCXLVI (talk to me!/c) 07:05, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Using the update to put back in ongoing instead of a final blurb would be fine too if preferable. And DiplomatTesterMan did more updates on the article before that, he still deserves some credit too I think. - Indefensible (talk) 07:12, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose because the article is not sufficiently updated. There is currently a 1 sentence mention in the lead of the repeal of the laws, and no mention of it, nor of any follow-on protests, anywhere in the body of the article. Before this can be posted, the latest developments would need to be added to the article appropriately. --Jayron32 12:18, 19 November 2021 (UTC) @Jayron32 Have you read the repeal section? Dracophyllum 20:10, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Your response is 8 hours after Jayron32's, Dracophyllum. The section may have not existed when Jayron commented. But then again, I am not going to take the time to check if it did exist at 12:18 PM UTC on 19 Nov 2021. Tube·of·Light 02:30, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: The announcement by itself has no legal value. Parliament has to repeal the laws, which it will probably do in the coming Winter Session. Also some farmer's unions are continuing protests until the laws are repealed and minimum support prices reconsidered. So it might be better to wait, but no strong opinion either way. --Jose Mathew (talk) 12:24, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Wait and see what the impact of this is.

India-centric Very India centric. It's probably not even the most important news in India right now, let alone the world.

In fact, we do post many India-centric stories here, this one having festered in ongoing for nearly a year. --LaserLegs (talk) 23:36, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support. Invariably it is announcements that get more attention than the actual act, most of the time(we post elections when the result is known, not when the results are official/certified). If Modi renegs, that will likely be newsworthy itself. 331dot (talk) 23:16, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Weak oppose - as Wilhelm Tell DCCXLVI says, the BKU is still protesting. I would prefer waiting till the laws are actually repealed (and FWIW, these laws are being repealed just before the 2022 Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly elections and elections in some other states, which are crucial for Modi's political party). Tube·of·Light 02:30, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – On article quality – and as others have noted because the laws haven't taken effect.

The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 21:41, 19 November 2021 (UTC) You're forgetting that lunar eclipses often presage globally cataclysmic events, such as permanent cancellation of The Boat Race, which I fear may now be in the offing for 2022. – Sca (talk) 13:30, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Of course, lunar eclipses and the Boat Race are entirely unrelated. And of course, there will be no "permanent cancellation of The Boat Race", that's total bollocks, but perhaps inline with your regular contributions. As you perhaps should know already, The Boat Race 2022 is scheduled for next year, and if COVID stymies it, one imagines it will simply be moved to the River Great Ouse once again. I'm unclear as to where you think that a lunar eclipse would be a portent for the permanent cancellation of an event which has been conducted since 1829, even before the Third Reich failed to play nicely. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 17:56, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Ease up, Ramblo, it was a joke. (And BTW, the Third Reich and this topic are entirely unrelated.) – Sca (talk) 18:26, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Yeah, and this topic and the Boat Race are completely unrelated. And it wasn't funny in any sense. So explain yourself. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 18:45, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support, this lunar eclipse has gotten significant news coverage.

Joseph2302 (talk) 20:40, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: Perhaps the blurb can mention the evacuation of thousands of residents and the destruction of infrastructure. Power outage and a small death toll won't cut it. --PFHLai (talk) 22:35, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Comment - this is quite a significant event in Canada, with reports that it could become the most expensive natural disaster in Canadian history [7], the death toll is expected to rise, along with wide ranging effects on supply chains and transportation networks. If I recall correctly, I think we did post the 2013 Alberta floods, for precedent. Connormah (talk) 22:39, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I guess "could be" is key here. If it does become the most expensive natural disaster after electing Trudeau in the history of Canada, then it's well placed for a blurb. Maybe now is premature. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:42, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Wait Living through this, it's a pretty devastating disaster, with all road access cut off to and from the Port of Vancouver, which is having a major impact on supply chains across Western Canada. But I don't think this meets the standard previously set for ITN just yet, although there are reports that the death toll is expected to rise. There's also reports of an imminent dike breach into a large city. As such, I'd suggest that we wait.

(Post) Alternative blurb: ?Russia shoots down Kosmos 1408 with an anti-satellite weapon, creating a field of space debris. Alternative blurb II: ?Kosmos 1408 is destroyed by a Russian anti-satellite weapon and turned into a stream of space debris. News source(s): BBC, AP, Reuters, Guardian, Bloomberg Credits: Nominated by Andrew Davidson (talk · give credit) Created by Mike Peel (talk · give credit) Updated by Smeagol 17 (talk · give credit) Article updated Nominator's comments: We have some real news about the ISS now as the crew have to take shelter from a shower of debris created by a Russian missile test. And the Kessler syndrome advances another notch. What we're mainly missing is a good picture but we might use something generic like this. Andrew?(talk) 12:56, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support in principle, as this is a significant event for the space industry (more so than Crew-3 that we already have on the template). However the article is pretty lightweight and could use some expansion. It also needs a source for the claim that Russia was responsible for the test - we can't claim something in the blurb that isn't cited in the article. I would also remove 'dangerous' from the blurb as that's quite a strong accusation. Modest Genius talk 13:05, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Article seems fine now, though as I was one of the users updating it an independent assessment would be welcome. Modest Genius talk 18:16, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support on the merits; the use of an anti-satellite weapon(even as a test) is rare and few countries possess such technology. Russia isn't denying it. 331dot (talk) 13:10, 16 November 2021 (UTC) @331dot: Yes, the use is rare and few countries possess such technology. Yet, I remember a similar test from India a couple of years ago was rejected as the technology "has been around for a while." If I recall correctly, there had been significant debate about debris back then too. 2405:201:4013:8087:A828:E291:B9B5:4B09 (talk) 18:31, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I can only comment on the nomination in front of me; I can't speak to past ones at this time. 331dot (talk) 19:15, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support in principle though article needs to include that Russia shot it down (right now, the article just says it broke up). And other cn tags in article would need fixing. Though I agree, this is way more important/notable/covered in news sources than Crew-3. Joseph2302 (talk) 13:12, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Comment I started putting this through DYK earlier today, see Template:Did you know nominations/Kosmos 1408, since I haven't enjoyed participating in previous ITN discussions. But if you want this here, then the DYK can be withdrawn. I've updated the template above, since I started the article yesterday. Thanks. Mike Peel (talk) 13:14, 16 November 2021 (UTC) One option would be to merge this into the existing Crew-3 ISS mission blurb. If Kosmos 1408 is not bolded then it can still be a DYK too. Andrew?(talk) 13:22, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I oppose merging those blurbs - these are separate events. Modest Genius talk 14:07, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I also oppose merging- they're separate events, and this one is more important, so shouldn't be stuck on the end of some less important and newswirthy article that's only on the front page because it was alledgedly ITNR (even though that ITNR criteria was demonstrated to be unfit for purpose). And if this does reach front page, then DYK would no longer be eligible, but until that point, don't see a need to withdraw the DYK nom. Joseph2302 (talk) 14:30, 16 November 2021 (UTC) We could remove the Crew-3 blurb and replace it with this one when this is ready to go (assuming Crew-3 is still on ITN). Yeah, it doesn't get its "full time" there, but I agree that it doesn't make sense to merge, but having two ISS-related things could be seen as overwhelming the box. --Masem (t) 14:35, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – Fairly widely covered, but broader significance of a "threat" to the ISS isn't so apparent. – Sca (talk) 13:38, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Even a fleck of paint could seriously damage the ISS, one of the most expensive objects ever constructed. 331dot (talk) 11:14, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support in principle. This is very significant news and an interesting story of high encyclopedic value.--Kiril Simeonovski (talk) 13:41, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support in principle per above, just needs better fleshing out of the article. --Masem (t) 13:53, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – Upon reflection, it seems to be a serious threat all right, but ... can we post something that hasn't had a tangible effect ... yet? – Sca (talk) 14:11, 16 November 2021 (UTC) PS: My question is, did Putin authorize this stupid 'test' – or was it just an act of heedless military apparatchiks down in the bureaucracy? (Russia is an oligarchy that has a country – a country that has an enormous military.) – Sca (talk) 14:19, 16 November 2021 (UTC) The way I'm reading it, the story is more that Russia has appeared to have violated a treaty related to space-bound weapons, in addition to this being a story of interest to space exploration (the potential of damage to the ISS that forced the crew to shelter for at least two orbits as it passed through the debris field). --Masem (t) 14:17, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Reasonable enough. However, the threat to human lives (including two Russians!) seems more compelling in terms of reader interest. – Sca (talk) 14:22, 16 November 2021 (UTC) From our article on the Outer Space Treaty: "Although it forbids establishing military bases, testing weapons and conducting military maneuvers on celestial bodies, the treaty does not expressly ban all military activities in space, nor the establishment of military space forces or the placement of conventional weapons in space". Testing an anti-satellite weapon on your own target is not against any treaty, just regarded as irresponsible. Note that the US, China and India have all conducted similar tests with no legal repercussions or UN censure. Modest Genius talk 15:09, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose no longer fresh, not really in the news, rolled off a while ago and probably better suited for DYK. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 16:11, 16 November 2021 (UTC) What's your time frame for "no longer fresh"? The BBC article is only 12 hours old and the event itself occurred yesterday. It's certainly a newer event than anything currently in the ITN box... --Jayron32 16:16, 16 November 2021 (UTC) (edit conflict) The BBC published two more articles about this story in just the last hour [8] [9]. That seems pretty fresh. Modest Genius talk 16:19, 16 November 2021 (UTC) It happened yesterday, and is very much still in the news. Much more so than the posted blurbs, such as the NYC Marathon on 7 November for example. Joseph2302 (talk) 16:20, 16 November 2021 (UTC) OH sure, you can dig into websites and find more analysis, but it's not headline news and hasn't been for most of the day now. Even the article makes it clear that the "main event" has passed. Biggest headlines in the UK are now that Johnson is proposing to prevent MPs from getting paid consultancy jobs. This story is no longer even on the BBC News homepage. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 16:24, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support Article is short, but sufficient; it seems to have developed some since the earlier notes. Topic is being covered by reliable news sources. --Jayron32 16:17, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose ... for now. Article text comprises 340 words, of which 115 are background, leaving a mere 230 words about the current threat. IMO, too thin for MP promotion. Second, we shouldn't blurb something that hasn't had an impact (yet). – Sca (talk) 17:03, 16 November 2021 (UTC) PS: Given that the current situation could continue for quite some time, perhaps after a bit we should consider posting this directly to Ongoing. – Sca (talk) 17:10, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Whatever political fallout there has been is pretty much so far just a short but important burst (for blurb posting), but there's no sign this is going to escalate into something further, in comparison to the nuclear submarine sale a few months back. --Masem (t) 19:50, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Wait is there a real danger debris hits other satellites soon, or is this just "an abundance of caution"? Will there be significant geo-political ramifications from the test? Until one of those is "yes", I think we should wait. User:? (powera, ?, ?) 19:52, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Everywhere is at risk for disaster, but this info is nothing like disaster actually happening. Political story, and involving two countries who always bicker. Could change if the ISS is destroyed or something stronger than words breaks out. InedibleHulk (talk) 20:46, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Is this an RD nom for the destruction of Kosmos 1408? If so, its "career section" needs an expansion to describe how it was used while still in orbit and operational.--PFHLai (talk) 23:08, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Questionable significance as far as potential impacts, especially given at the moment it is just predictive. I would assume that the test itself is not sufficient for ITN, so I'm on the "Oppose" side here. DarkSide830 (talk) 00:01, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support even if nothing happens to the ISS, ASAT weapon tests don't happen every day, or even every year. Banedon (talk) 03:44, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support Certainly magnitudes more important than the multitude of launches posted every now and then on ITN. Gotitbro (talk) 07:09, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support significant, made the news and the article Kosmos 1408 is short but adequate. Given the military nature of this satellite and its destruction, we can't expect to know that many details. Of the proposed blurbs, only alt 1 is good. --LukeSurl t c 10:02, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support in principle this is a significant story BUT it simply cannot be posted with a blurb of this quality. Its language is misleading and makes it sound as if a functional satellite was attacked, but rather a defunct satellite was destroyed as part of a weapons test... slightly different. Possibly also include the name of the missile system, if known, and replace "Russia" with the actual agency overseeing the test. JMonkey2006 (talk) 11:10, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Feel free to propose a different blurb. Or we could simply add 'defunct' before the name of the satellite. Modest Genius talk 11:38, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – Absent from main RS sites on Wednesday; no longer in the news. Seems a minor issue without tangible effects. Neither target article is really about this event. – Sca (talk) 12:42, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support in principle per JMonkey. Fakescientist8000 (talk) 13:54, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support. The Kessler syndrome may have been triggered: "The Kessler syndrome is troublesome because of the domino effect and feedback runaway wherein impacts between objects of sizable mass spall off debris from the force of the collision. The fragments can then hit other objects, producing even more space debris: if a large enough collision or explosion were to occur, such as between a space station and a defunct satellite, or as the result of hostile actions in space, then the resulting debris cascade could make prospects for long-term viability of satellites in particular low Earth orbits extremely low." Count Iblis (talk) 14:52, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support - Russia is weaponizing space. Whether or not they were the first to do it - and presumably they weren't - this is an indication of a change in global affairs when it comes to outer space.--WaltCip-(talk) 16:16, 17 November 2021 (UTC) If you didn't know (see anti-satellite weapon), the first ASAT test was in 1959, and was conducted by the US. Banedon (talk) 02:06, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Comment any admins around here to post this? I oppose its inclusion as it's already stale in my opinion, but there's a pretty clear consensus here and the longer it's left unposted, the staler it becomes....

The election comission has announced that We Continue the Change has won most seats, so therefore such a nomination can now be made. As we have posted the winner in the previous elections, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:In_the_news/Candidates/July_2021#(Posted)_Bulgarian_parliamentary_election. They are a new party too, so surprising. I have added a result synopsis and started the aftermath. Good article, have spent a lot of time on it myself with a few others. BastianMAT (talk) 14:45, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Support Article has minimum of prose describing the leadup, results, and aftermath. More writing would be nice, but it's passable for the main page. Everything is referenced and it has prose, which is more than can be said for many of the nominations of this type. --Jayron32 12:01, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: Is it time to start the English wikibio for the other co-leader of We Continue the Change, Asen Vasilev? The coalition has two leaders, not just Petkov. Do we want to wait till a government is formed? --PFHLai (talk) 12:01, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I guess yeah, he deserves one too, but Petkov is the primary focus here as he is the one seeking to become prime minister (per https://www.euronews.com/2021/11/14/bulgarian-elections-newly-formed-pp-party-neck-and-neck-with-right-wing-gerb-party). The truth is we don't even know yet if they will be successful forming a goverment, but we posted both the Czech party SPOLU and the last Bulgarian election when ITN won the most seats as the election itself is ITNR, so going by that this nomination/blurb should be suitable to make it out to the front page.BastianMAT (talk) 12:17, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support Article is in great shape. I think the easiest way to solve what PFHLai exposes is to put in the blurb that Petkov is the "co-leader", thus making it understood that he is not the only one leading the coalition. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 12:42, 16 November 2021 (UTC) How about not mentioning either co-leaders in the blurb? (See alt1) I'm not sure about using the proposed photo of Petkov on MainPage, anyway. --PFHLai (talk) 22:40, 16 November 2021 (UTC) We can do that too if there are any issues with the image, no problem.

Remember, go for it!. Fakescientist8000 (talk) 15:19, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Comment I wanted to nominate this but hasitated. Are these midterms considered general elections? Half of the seats in the lower chamber and 1/3 of the upper chamber are up for election and our article defines general elections as "elections in which all or most members of a political body are chosen." Scaramouche33 (talk) 16:16, 15 November 2021 (UTC) I half-wondered if such "mid-term" elections were covered by ITNR. If they are, perhaps that should also be explicitly noted at ITNR. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 16:19, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Yeah, mid terms elections are part of it, it is notable too as the ruling party have lost their majority. Here is the US one that was also posted. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:In_the_news/Candidates/November_2018#(Posted)_2018_US_Midterm_Elections.BastianMAT (talk) 16:28, 15 November 2021 (UTC) But that was mainly because it involved "all or most members of a political body are chosen". This doesn't appear to be the case here. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 16:44, 15 November 2021 (UTC) It depends on how you see on it. The mid term senate elections in US only feature 34 members up running for election. In Argentina it was half of the congress and enough for an significant change in both political bodies (ruling party losing control of both the house and the senate).BastianMAT (talk) 16:53, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Well it doesn't matter what happened in the US, how does this meet the requirements at ITNR? The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 16:59, 15 November 2021 (UTC) From what I understand, in the US midterms all House seats+1/3 of Senate seats were up for election so that would be considered as "most members of an electoral body" but here it's only half. Does that still count as general elections? If so it's ITN/R, if not who knows. Scaramouche33 (talk) 17:14, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Yeah I agree, it is arguable for both sides. At least based on this, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midterm_election, Argentina[1] (legislative and local election) falls under the heading General elections (which makes it ITNR) alongside the United States (legislative and local election) which was posted.BastianMAT (talk) 17:17, 15 November 2021 (UTC) I'm not sure it is arguable here, it doesn't meet the definition in ITNR and it's a mid-term, not a general election by any normal definition (despite what "Wikipedia" might say). The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 17:30, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – First four grafs back into the results and seem needlessly complex. – Sca (talk) 17:19, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Comment the table in the infobox violates MOS:COLHEAD by having column headers in the middle of the table.

The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 18:04, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose This was a minor terrorist attack that caused only one casualty. Now we are not concerned about the number of victims?

Martinevans123 (talk) 18:40, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. Failed attack which caused one injury and killed the attacker. It's not clear what the target was or who it was supposed to terrorise. If this hadn't been declared a terrorist incident it would be minor local news. I encourage the existing DYK nom instead. Modest Genius talk 19:02, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Regardless of terrorism tag, I suspect this would have been national news. But of course, we will never know. The fact is it is big national news. Martinevans123 (talk) 19:07, 16 November 2021 (UTC) But it was declared a terrorist attack, which adds notability to the incident. Jbvann05 20:32, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Not really, it just grants the police additional powers and generates more headlines. The actual event doesn't become any worse.

Martinevans123 (talk) 21:05, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you for your answer because clearly I've realized that I have not expressed myself well. I mean that at the time, the reason why I've opposed was the same used by other users (who have not participated in this debate, except Modest Genius) to not support the cited nomination in September. That is why I am frankly surprised. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 21:29, 16 November 2021 (UTC) BLP Caution One suspect is dead, but four others are arrested in connection; might want to attribute this "attempted terrorist bombing" instead of stating it as a fact Wikipedia knows (a "declaration" from police is still an allegation).

Norman Butkiss 123 (talk) 22:47, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. I will admit to perhaps being more jaded to bomb stories than some other nationalities may be, but even with that notwithstanding, I don't believe we'd be considering an attack which killed no victims and injured one if it took place elsewhere (we recently didn't post, for example, an attack that targeted but didn't kill a head of state). That isn't necessarily to say there's any deliberate bias here but it's important to remember that England has a well-developed media sphere and any regional story will have a lot of domestic coverage, but we are not necessarily beholden to repeat their biases. For reference, even the BBC have displaced this story in favour of the latest update in a racism dispute in county cricket. ??????? ? 21:46, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support major incident, leading news story, article decent. Polyamorph (talk) 21:48, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support (Alt 2). UK terror threat level raised from substantial to severe pushes it over the edge. Martinevans123 (talk) 23:15, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose As suicide in Britain goes, it was unusually public and explosive, but lacks too much death and destruction next to the general public suicide bombings (a similar story from Strathroy-Caradoc#History isn't even an article, for context). InedibleHulk (talk) 23:19, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose -- it's already stopped being news, it seems. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 02:50, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Questionable significance since nothing major [fortunately] did not take place. Gotitbro (talk) 07:12, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose as the investigation has not been completed and it has not been confirmed yet whether it was terrorism, whether the detonation was intentional or accidental, or who the intended victim or victims might to have been.

Opinion is generally permitted if it's clearly attributed? Thanks. Martinevans123 (talk) 11:21, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Very Strong Oppose Per WP:Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, we are supposed to be an encyclopedia, and we are NOT supposed to be a dangerous free publicity machine for every murderous suicidal nutter, still less for every would-be terrorist and every terrorist organisation. So a terrorist incident should be truly exceptional and notable before appearing on our front page, all the more so as it is often liable to remain there giving dangerous free publicity (and thus in practice encouragement) to terrorists and other murderous nutters long after it has disappeared from the front pages of other mainstream Western news outlets (as many terrorists probably already realize, even if many editors around here seemingly don't). There is NOTHING in this incident that gives it the required exceptionality and notability to justify the danger this poses to innocent people, as well as the damage it might (rightly in my view) do to our reputation. Tlhslobus (talk) 18:15, 17 November 2021 (UTC) See WP:RIGHTGREATWRONGS. Your diatribe is interesting, but nothing to do with ITNC, otherwise we'd never publish another mass shooting in the US ever again. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 18:27, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose No lasting effect plus terrible disjointed article means it's a No from me, Bob. Black Kite (talk) 18:23, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose The story stopped trending yesterday, and the death/injury toll is very low (luckily). If attacks of this kind were rare in the UK I would be willing to overlook these factors, but (unfortunately) there's been a seemingly-steady uptick in the last couple of years, so there's nothing about this that makes it stand out. Mount Patagonia (talk) 18:27, 17 November 2021 (UTC) But the satellite blow-up stopped trending 36 hours ago and no-one died. Terror attacks where bombs are ignited on Remembrance Day are few and far between, I'm sure you can point me to the last time that happened, right? The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 18:29, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I was referencing upticks in UK-based terror attacks in general, not ones falling on Rememberance Day. If terror attacks that fell on special occasions were automatic shoe-ins, then last year's Christmas bombing in Nashville would have been posted, but it wasn't for the same reasons I'm opposing posting this story. For the Russian satellite, take it up with the people for voted for it because I had no involvement in that decision. Mount Patagonia (talk) 22:06, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Indeed, terror attacks often happen on supposedly significant days or dates (sometimes perhaps coincidentally, sometimes perhaps as part of an attempt to increase the attack's psychological impact, or perhaps sometimes for quasi-religious reasons). Not only do we not use this as an excuse to put it into ITN, we sometimes leave it out of the article as well. For instance it was 5 years before Wikipedia mentioned that the Bataclan attacks occurred on Friday the 13th and there is still no link from it to the article about the superstition, presumably because RS don't mention such a link (perhaps to avoid making vulnerable people more fearful or otherwise psychologically distressed or harmed whenever 'significant' dates approach). Tlhslobus (talk) 15:33, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Comment we don't need to name the perp in any of the blurbs. That's totally undue. Get a grip people. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 18:30, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I've been bold and removed the name of the perp. We don't need that, even if this isn't posted, anywhere near this encyclopedia. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 20:17, 17 November 2021 (UTC) The name of the perpetrator is encyclopedic and should be in the article; but I agree that it should not be posted in ITN regardless. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 00:14, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose No victims and unclear / unorganised motive. Belugsump (talk) 03:44, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – Limited significance. No longer in the news. – Sca (talk) 13:06, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose.

It doesn't seem at all controversial though, so should be easy to source from a few match reports (such as those linked above). Modest Genius talk 12:33, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Comment the table in "Road to the final" section is ugly- couldn't this just be done in a paragraph of text, as in 2016 article? Joseph2302 (talk) 14:36, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Agree. It's also not compliant with MOS:ACCESS since it contains nested tables. This should be fixed before it's posted on the main page.  — Amakuru (talk) 17:17, 15 November 2021 (UTC) MOS:DTAB is a laudable goal, but not one of the WP:ITNCRIT. It's probably moot though, as no improvements to the article have been made in the last 3 days. Modest Genius talk 11:36, 17 November 2021 (UTC) While articles on topics such as sporting events and economics lend themselves to tables of numbers, updates must be at least in part written in prose to qualify for ITN consideration. That isn't the case here, as the section in question is using ugly nested tables rather than prose (like I suggested doing days ago).

(WFTV) 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference At COP26, diplomats from countries around the world reach a major agreement aimed at intensifying global efforts to fight climate change by calling on governments to return next year with stronger plans to curb planet-warming emissions and urging wealthy nations to "at least double" their funding in order to protect poorer nations from the hazards of a warming planet. Some activists are critical of the agreement, as it leaves unresolved the question of how much and how quickly each nation should cut its carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions over the next decade, and it still leaves many developing countries short of the funds that they would need in order to cope with increasing weather disasters. However, the agreement makes reference to fossil fuels and their role in the climate crisis for the first time in the conference's history.

Alternative blurb II: ?The Glasgow Climate Pact is agreed at COP26 to attempt to limit the rise in global temperatures by 1.5°C. News source(s): BBC, NYT, ABC, AP, Guardian, Reuters Credits: Nominated by JMonkey2006 (talk · give credit) Nominator's comments: The Paris Agreement was posted after COP21 concluded. This agreement is the same, if not more important for global climate action. JMonkey2006 (talk) 01:45, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Comment Glasgow Climate Pact obviously isn't remotely close to being front-page quality, and 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference doesn't say what happened either. Once this is updated, I will probably support on importance. User:? (powera, ?, ?) 02:52, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose there's at least enough article to vote. Article still has issues; the "Pledges" section is describing things agreed at the conference that don't appear to be specifically part of the "Glasgow Climate Pact", and the link to Wikisource isn't broken. As far as importance ... we posted the conference once, and the biggest news is that there are plans to decrease coal usage ... this isn't worth posting again. User:? (powera, ?, ?) 01:06, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Support – in principle ... pending updating and succinct revision of 2021 climate conference article. It would be very odd not to blurb this universally covered confab, now over. – Sca (talk) 13:44, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Comment That we already posted the COP26 earlier, and that the general impression of the Glasgow Pact that I get from sources is that it is far less as a milestone compared to the Paris Agreements (since it basically affirms commitment to them) makes me wonder if this is really that significant to post a second time. --Masem (t) 14:23, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Au contraire. Despite disappointments, 'world leaders' said to "broadly welcome" the climate deal, which "for the first time targeted fossil fuels." At least they did something. Prominently covered by every major RS site. – Sca (talk) 15:28, 14 November 2021 (UTC) That sentence wasn't over. First time targeting fossil fuels "as the key driver of global warming". Whatever that means. InedibleHulk (talk) 16:29, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Resistance is futile. "In asking nations to set tougher targets by next year for cutting climate-warming emissions, the agreement effectively acknowledged that commitments were still inadequate. National pledges currently have the world on track for about 2.4C of warming." The article quality outlook is also dire. InedibleHulk (talk) 16:38, 14 November 2021 (UTC) We're not here to judge the work of the conferees. We're here to take note a very heavily covered, extended international conference that was widely and prominently covered. Do I think the so-called climate pact will solve global warming? No (although it might be a move in the right direction). What you or I think of it doesn't matter. What matters is, it was/is very much in the news, and the topic is hugely significant. – Sca (talk) 17:32, 14 November 2021 (UTC) The work of the conferees is the topic. If the news reports the commitments made therein as inadequate, it's not hugely significant in the broader and more newsworthy topic area of global warming prevention. This running conference is just in the news because it was long expected to end today somehow. InedibleHulk (talk) 17:45, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Nope. Even if they had done nothing it would be significant for reasons outlined above. – Sca (talk) 17:49, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I respectfully disagree. InedibleHulk (talk) 17:54, 14 November 2021 (UTC) If we hadn't posted the COP26 thing earlier, I would have been fine with posting this as an ending point as generally the overall conference was in the news. But given that we already did and this new piece is not a major piece of environmental commitment compared to the Paris Agreement, double posting this is just not appropriate. --Masem (t) 22:25, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose article is short and unsourced in places. Also, given the Paris Agreement exists, it seems the impact of this is minimal (limited only to reducing coal). Joseph2302 (talk) 09:00, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Support on the merits; it's unusual for 197 countries to agree to any single document, even if largely a statement of principles or desires. But agree it is not yet suitable for posting. 331dot (talk) 10:02, 15 November 2021 (UTC) It should be pointed out that not all 190-some signing countries are committed to the same parts of the document: for example, only 40+ are on board with coal reduction. Hence why this is far less impactful as the Paris Agreements. --Masem (t) 13:41, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Support original blurb in principle, oppose on quality. The pact is a bit of a damp squib, far less ambitious than expected or required. However we're not here to judge the outcome, just whether it meets the ITN criteria. This is certainly in the news, at or near the top of every quality media outlet. However the pact article is barely a start class and needs some major TLC before being postable. I considered bolding the COP26 article again, but its 'outcomes' section is in even worse state. Modest Genius talk 12:20, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – Conspicuous omission from ITN blurb box. – Sca (talk) 13:05, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Sca As several users have noted, there are quality issues preventing posting. If you want to see it posted, you are welcome to fix those issues. 331dot (talk) 13:43, 15 November 2021 (UTC) (edit conflict) Sca In what sense? The article is not good enough for front page quality (as ITN isn't OTD, which likes to post poorly sourced articles), and there's no consensus to post it anyway, as they don't seem to have all agreed anything (as different countries signed different agreements). If you want news pushed out as fast as possible, use a news website. Joseph2302 (talk) 13:44, 15 November 2021 (UTC) "likes"? Oh, come on. Be nice to our colleagues and neighbours on MainPage. They are rather understaffed there in SA/OTD. It's more like "less than ideal stuff sneaking through too often". But I'm off-topic... --PFHLai (talk) 14:32, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose - given that we already posted the COP26 once, and the headline agreement doesn't appear to be a huge step forward, I don't see a need to post it again. Maybe next time we can hold off posting the opening of such events so that we can capture a one-time interesting headline for readers.  — Amakuru (talk) 22:09, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – Getting stale. – Sca (talk) 15:26, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – Stale.

Admin instructions are here. ??Skip to suggestions In the news toolbox Error reports Nominations (Archives) Discussion General criteria Death criteria Recurring items Admin guide Image protection Current events portal v t e Shortcut WP:ITN/C This page provides a forum for editors to suggest items for inclusion on In the news (ITN), a protected template on the Main Page, as well as the forum for discussion of candidates. This is not the page to report errors in the ITN section on the Main Page—please go to the appropriate section at WP:ERRORS. Archives of past nominations can be found here. This candidates page is integrated with the daily pages of Portal:Current events. Under each daily section header below is the transcluded Portal:Current events items for that day (with a light green header). Each day's portal page is followed by a subsection for suggestions and discussion. A blurb is a one sentence summary of the news story. An alternate suggestion for the blurb is called an altblurb, and any more suggestions get labelled alt1, alt2, etc. A blurb needs at least one target article, highlighted in bold; reviewers check the quality of that article and whether it is updated, and whether reliable sources demonstrate the significance of the event. Other articles can also be linked. The Ongoing line is for regularly updated articles which cover events that remain in the news over a longer period of time. RD stands for the "recent deaths" line, and can include any living thing whose death was recently announced. In some cases, recent deaths may need additional explanation as provided by a blurb; this is decided by consensus.

Find the correct section below for the date of the event (not the date nominated). Do not add sections for new dates. These are automatically generated (at midnight UTC) by a bot; creating them manually breaks this process. Nominate the blurb for ITN inclusion under the "Suggestions" subheading for the date, emboldening the link in the blurb to the updated article. Use a level 4 header (====) when doing so. Preferably use the template {{ITN candidate}} to nominate the article related to the event in the news. Make sure that you include a reference from a verifiable, reliable secondary source. Press releases are not acceptable. The suggested blurb should be written in simple present tense. Adding an explanation why the event should be posted greatly increases the odds of posting. Please consider alerting editors to the nomination by adding the template {{ITN note}} to the corresponding article's talk page. Purge this page to update the cache There are criteria which guide the decision on whether or not to put a particular item on In the news, based largely on the extensiveness of the updated content and the perceived significance of the recent developments. These are listed at WP:ITN. Submissions that do not follow the guidelines at Wikipedia:In the news will not be placed onto the live template. Headers[edit] Items that have been posted or pulled from the main page are generally marked with (Posted) or (Pulled) in the item's subject so it is clear they are no longer active. Items can also be marked as (Ready) when the article is both updated and there seems to be a consensus to post. The posting admin, however, should always judge the update and the consensus to post themselves. If you find an entry that you don't feel is ready to post is marked (Ready), you should remove the mark in the header. Voicing an opinion on an item[edit] Format your comment to contain "support" or "oppose", and include a rationale for your choice. In particular, address the notability of the event, the quality of the article, and whether it has been updated. Please do not...[edit] add simple "support!" or "oppose!" votes without including your reasons. Similarly, curt replies such as "who?", "meh", or "duh!" are usually not helpful. Instead, explain the reasons why you think the item meets or does not meet the ITN inclusion criteria so a consensus can be reached. oppose an item because the event is only relating to a single country, or failing to relate to one. This applies to a high percentage of the content we post and is unproductive. accuse other editors of supporting, opposing or nominating due to a personal bias (such as ethnocentrism). Conflicts of interest are not handled at ITN. comment on a story without first reading the relevant article(s). oppose a recurring item here because you disagree with the recurring items criteria. The criteria can be discussed at the relevant talk page.

(Post) Alternative blurb: ?Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai is reported missing after accusing former Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli of sexual assault. News source(s): Guardian Credits: Nominated by Blythwood (talk · give credit) Article updatedNominator's comments: Seems to be a forced disappearance. This is a bit unusual, but has been a major news story. Disappearance section seems solid but the rest of the article on her career is less well sourced. The person has disappeared without a trace, so while it cannot be verified that this person person has died or been imprisoned, her disappearance is in itself the notable event. I wonder if this could be treated as something like the equivalent of a recent death. Blythwood (talk) 22:39, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support - Article is in good condition and the news is prominent, exceptional, and of great public interest around the world. Jehochman Talk 22:45, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose - Article appear in news, but headlines on CBC, CNN, BBC are still focused on Rittenhouse Trial for now, although this may change. Otherwise, the blurb should describe whats happening now (the reactions), that she has not been publicly heard is not ITN as that is a few days old. 99.247.176.90 (talk) 23:06, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose - I fail to see how this is any more worthy of ITN than the Rittenhouse trial, which was also not worthy of ITN. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 23:10, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Please don't oppose because you think another nomination should be posted and you don't think this one is as worthy. Judge nomination on its own merit. The two are about completely different things. -- KTC (talk) 23:12, 19 November 2021 (UTC) I don't think either are worthy of being posted. --RockstoneSend me a message! 01:20, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support per Jehochman. However I'm not quite sure about the term "disappears" here, even if I personally think the Chinese state did exactly that. -- KTC (talk) 23:16, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support per Jehochman. -- Tavix (talk) 23:20, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support this is far more notable than "another white American kills black Americans" and regardless of the fact that headlines are currently obsessing over the US proclivity to allow kids to routinely assassinate people without any kind of criminal conviction, Peng's disappearance is genuinely newsworthy and encyclopedic. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 23:23, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Not that it matters to this nomination, but Rittenhouse's victims were white.

InedibleHulk (talk) 02:06, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose on quality The article needs a lot of work, as there are multiple sections with no inline citations.Pawnkingthree (talk) 23:42, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support While this might be unduly implicative of the Chinese state being connected, if RSs are making that connection this definitely belongs. – John M Wolfson (talk • contribs) 00:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose on quality I would support this if the article has some ref work done. There's sections that are unsourced. --TDKR Chicago 101 (talk) 00:34, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose this is newsworthy for sure but blurbing that someone "disappeared" after making an accusation seems like a WP:BLPCRIME issue to me. --LaserLegs (talk) 00:39, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Completely agree it's an awkward thing to summarise in a way that fits BLP while keeping it clear why the event is notable, I'd welcome suggestions for alternative phrasing. I realise this is a fairly limited action, but for that reason I deliberately didn't link to the person she accused in the proposed blurb. Blythwood (talk) 01:57, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose as per LaserLegs, there's something wrong about posting speculation that someone disappeared straight after they made accusations. With little reliable information, this seems like a BLP issue to post it. Joseph2302 (talk) 01:47, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Far too speculative, with overtones of anti-China sentiment, and with too many unknowns. Needs far more clarification before it is posted. And a guarantee that ITN will publish a full We Were Wrong! statement and retraction on the Main page when it is found out she has just eloped with her boyfriend or girlfriend, as the case may be. HiLo48 (talk) 01:55, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Clearly if China "disappeared" her, that would be a story, but this appears to be Western nations making a demand of China and there's no hard evidence she has been killed or imprisoned or the like. We don't post this type of speculative stories. --Masem (t) 02:16, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support Per wide coverage in RSes. Normchou?? 03:22, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose unless the incident has a separate article. Sun8908?Talk 07:38, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support — article looks decent enough for ITN standards by my eye, wide coverage in RSes. If the choice of "disappears" is undesirable, then "is reported missing" might be a potential alternative (posted as altblurb). [osunpokeh/talk/contributions] 08:41, 20 November 2021 (UTC) I think that suggests she was reported missing in the police report sense, not that Novak Djokovic described her as "a missing person" to reporters. Not a bad idea. Just a bit ambiguous. InedibleHulk (talk) 09:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Strong support, in the news, top page news in many countries. The issue is she has suddenly disappeared after accusing a senior cabinet minister of a serious crime, and the involved parties are public figures indept of this incident, so there is nothing wrong as long as it is sourced and not stated as truth. Peng's disappearance and the resulting sports diplomacy pressure and boycott threats are sufficient Bumbubookworm (talk) 12:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Have you ever studied the difference between correlation and causation? HiLo48 (talk) 21:48, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Yes I have and I wonder if it's possible to have a maths competition over Wikipedia lol. I never said there was a causation, although I am sure many on Wikipedia have noted your hard-left POV eg trying to get all right of centre Australian newspapers struck off at RSN. Bumbubookworm (talk) 22:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Applause.

Something that may have happened isn't blurbworthy, no matter how widely it's hyped. – Sca (talk) 13:05, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose per Masem, Sca. It could be the start of something noteworthy, or it could be nothing. We can post when it turns out to be something noteworthy if it does. Usedtobecool ?? 13:23, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support - Do we post news around here anymore? Sometimes I do wonder.--WaltCip-(talk) 18:40, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support highly notable, good article. Polyamorph (talk) 20:03, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support per above. The article has unref'd sections about her tennis career, but the linked section is ready. Davey2116 (talk) 21:52, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. We shouldn't (and don't) post articles with multiple unsourced sections. The fact that the section linked in bold is referenced is irrelevant. Black Kite (talk) 23:26, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Wait Let's wait until we are 100% sure what has happened to her. Heythereimaguy (talk) 23:53, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Global Times continues to point to her, this time at a restaurant with a coach and friends, seemingly quite visible. Western speculation now turns to whether she's safe, though, or free from external interference or to be believed. All very personal and hard-to-answer questions, for anybody anywhere. InedibleHulk (talk) 00:10, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose it's just one person in a world where much worse things happen in other places like Ethiopia. Banedon (talk) 01:11, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose for now. Videos of Peng Shuai have supposedly surfaced. Nice4What (talk · contribs) – (Thanks ?) 03:30, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Support However, I propose removing the term 'Chinese' in front of Peng Shuai. It does not add to her character or her identity as a professional tennis player. Something along the lines of "Professional tennis player Peng Shuai disappears after accusing former Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli of sexual assault." would be better imo. However, we should also note the videos posted by Global Times editors (primarily those tweeted by editor-in-chief Hu Xijin) and their aftermath. JMonkey2006 (talk) 11:10, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – She's reappeared, online at least. End of story? – Sca (talk) 13:34, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Strong support Wide coverage by RSes and notable. Fakescientist8000 (talk) 14:05, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Still too murky and speculative, with little general impact. – Sca (talk) 15:24, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Leaving aside anything else, there is video evidence of her out and about so she hasn't been "disappeared" and isn't "missing". Whether or not something else is happening is in the realm of speculation, and would require a separate blurb. Also, very large swathes of the article on her career lack even a single citation. Is it not time to close this as no consensus already? Preceding posted by User:BSMRD – Sca (talk) 17:35, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: – Discussion tops 1,500 words. Posts running 4:3 against posting. – Sca (talk) 17:42, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Comment as nominator I'm willing to close soon now there's video of her alive (barring any big development, like it rapidly emerging this is an impersonator). Someone being in big trouble with their government isn't ITN-worthy, although I still think someone being forced-disappeared could be.

This applies to a high percentage of the content we post and is unproductive. – Muboshgu (talk) 19:04, 19 November 2021 (UTC) (edit conflict):*See the instructions above "Please do not...oppose an item because the event is only relating to a single country, or failing to relate to one. This applies to a high percentage of the content we post and is unproductive." "International notability" is not a criteria for posting at ITN, nor has it ever been. --Jayron32 19:05, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Well my direct opinion is that it is not notable. My reasoning is the discussion that already took place on the 2021 talk page. I also have previous discussions months ago where things highly notable to one country aren’t included. Elijahandskip (talk) 19:11, 19 November 2021 (UTC) This is not a discussion of the page 2021. The criteria established for other parts of Wikipedia don't apply here. If you wish to change the criteria used for the ITN box, then start a discussion at WT:ITN. Votes without valid rationales are given little weight. It's fine if you have a useful rationale, but merely "I don't think it's notable enough" does not provide any useful guidance to admins when deciding consensus. I mean, you're allowed to say any silly thing you want, I suppose, but you can't expect anyone to take you seriously if it isn't valid. --Jayron32 19:18, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Well since you don’t like my reasoning, just let me say “no”. People have supported ITN’s in the past without giving a reason, so my “Oppose” in this case will not have a reason. Elijahandskip (talk) 19:22, 19 November 2021 (UTC) As I said, it's a free world. People do nonsensical things all of the time. --Jayron32 19:24, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Yep, I couldn’t agree more. In reality, my oppose on this comes more to combat American Wikipedia vs English Wikipedia. There is a essay on Wikipedia that I recently read that has that meaning. Not everything that happens in America is notable for Wikipedia/2021/ITN/Portal Current Events, etc….Elijahandskip (talk) 19:34, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose (at least on news of just the verdict). It was a highly watched case in the U.S., but it was clear early on to many legal experts that are crying foul on judicial behavior. It is very very likely to see an appeal and so this is not the end. This is not like the result from the very public George Floyd protests (which we posted and had ongoing about those, and the verdict). That said, there had been concerns there may be rioting following an acquittal , and while I'm not seeing any immediate news on that, a major riot (akin to the LA riots after King's verdict) would likely be the newsworthy factor here. --Masem (t) 19:05, 19 November 2021 (UTC) There literally cannot be any appeal of a not guilty verdict. This is a core principle of how double jeopardy is handled in American jurisprudence. A not guilty jury verdict is basically always final. See [1]. There are some exceedingly rare exceptions to this, but none of them would apply in this case. An ordinary jury verdict of "not guilty" like this one (even in a controversial trial) is treated as basically sacrosanct, and there can be no appeals by the government. --Jayron32 19:08, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Except for the calls for a mistrial that are being entered now. I know there's complexities with double jeopardy there, but that's still on the books and that itself can be a legal process. --Masem (t) 19:15, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Um, what? There were calls for a mistrial by Rittenhouse's defense team prior to the jury verdict coming back. Now that the verdict is in their client's favor, I doubt highly they will press forward with these requests. Indeed, articles such as this one note "The verdict also meant that Judge Bruce Schroeder did not have to rule on the defense's motions for a mistrial." --Jayron32 19:23, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose as above. If we had to have an American court psychodrama today, the better option from a world-historical perspective would probably be the acquittal of the purported killers of Malcolm X. —Brigade Piron (talk) 19:20, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose AGF, but this is such a small story in the grand scheme. GreatCaesarsGhost 19:23, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Wait. It is too early to tell what impact this will have. It could be a Rodney King-like result where acquittal of the accused leads to broad social unrest, or it could pass with a shrug. I expect that we will know within 24 hours.

I wonder if we should put this blurb up now, or when Parliament repeals them and the farmers go home (don't have strong opinions either way, but I lean towards waiting). If we're going to put it up now, I've uploaded this screengrab of Modi's announcement from his CC-BY YouTube channel; we could use it. Btw Indefensible - Dracophyllum was the only updater, not DiplomatTesterMan. Kind regards, W. Tell DCCXLVI (talk to me!/c) 07:05, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Using the update to put back in ongoing instead of a final blurb would be fine too if preferable. And DiplomatTesterMan did more updates on the article before that, he still deserves some credit too I think. - Indefensible (talk) 07:12, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose because the article is not sufficiently updated. There is currently a 1 sentence mention in the lead of the repeal of the laws, and no mention of it, nor of any follow-on protests, anywhere in the body of the article. Before this can be posted, the latest developments would need to be added to the article appropriately. --Jayron32 12:18, 19 November 2021 (UTC) @Jayron32 Have you read the repeal section? Dracophyllum 20:10, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Your response is 8 hours after Jayron32's, Dracophyllum. The section may have not existed when Jayron commented.

Tube·of·Light 02:30, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: The announcement by itself has no legal value. Parliament has to repeal the laws, which it will probably do in the coming Winter Session. Also some farmer's unions are continuing protests until the laws are repealed and minimum support prices reconsidered. So it might be better to wait, but no strong opinion either way. --Jose Mathew (talk) 12:24, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Wait and see what the impact of this is.

In fact, we do post many India-centric stories here, this one having festered in ongoing for nearly a year. --LaserLegs (talk) 23:36, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support. Invariably it is announcements that get more attention than the actual act, most of the time(we post elections when the result is known, not when the results are official/certified). If Modi renegs, that will likely be newsworthy itself. 331dot (talk) 23:16, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Weak oppose - as Wilhelm Tell DCCXLVI says, the BKU is still protesting. I would prefer waiting till the laws are actually repealed (and FWIW, these laws are being repealed just before the 2022 Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly elections and elections in some other states, which are crucial for Modi's political party). Tube·of·Light 02:30, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – On article quality – and as others have noted because the laws haven't taken effect.

The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 21:41, 19 November 2021 (UTC) You're forgetting that lunar eclipses often presage globally cataclysmic events, such as permanent cancellation of The Boat Race, which I fear may now be in the offing for 2022. – Sca (talk) 13:30, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Of course, lunar eclipses and the Boat Race are entirely unrelated. And of course, there will be no "permanent cancellation of The Boat Race", that's total bollocks, but perhaps inline with your regular contributions. As you perhaps should know already, The Boat Race 2022 is scheduled for next year, and if COVID stymies it, one imagines it will simply be moved to the River Great Ouse once again. I'm unclear as to where you think that a lunar eclipse would be a portent for the permanent cancellation of an event which has been conducted since 1829, even before the Third Reich failed to play nicely. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 17:56, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Ease up, Ramblo, it was a joke. (And BTW, the Third Reich and this topic are entirely unrelated.) – Sca (talk) 18:26, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Yeah, and this topic and the Boat Race are completely unrelated. And it wasn't funny in any sense. So explain yourself. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 18:45, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support, this lunar eclipse has gotten significant news coverage.

It's the trend these days. – Sca (talk) 23:19, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose not important enough for ITN. If it wasn't in North America, something this unimportant wouldn't have even been nominated. Joseph2302 (talk) 20:40, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: Perhaps the blurb can mention the evacuation of thousands of residents and the destruction of infrastructure. Power outage and a small death toll won't cut it. --PFHLai (talk) 22:35, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Comment - this is quite a significant event in Canada, with reports that it could become the most expensive natural disaster in Canadian history [5], the death toll is expected to rise, along with wide ranging effects on supply chains and transportation networks. If I recall correctly, I think we did post the 2013 Alberta floods, for precedent. Connormah (talk) 22:39, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I guess "could be" is key here. If it does become the most expensive natural disaster after electing Trudeau in the history of Canada, then it's well placed for a blurb. Maybe now is premature. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:42, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Wait Living through this, it's a pretty devastating disaster, with all road access cut off to and from the Port of Vancouver, which is having a major impact on supply chains across Western Canada. But I don't think this meets the standard previously set for ITN just yet, although there are reports that the death toll is expected to rise. There's also reports of an imminent dike breach into a large city. As such, I'd suggest that we wait. NorthernFalcon (talk) 22:51, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – Lots of damage & dislocation but so far only one fatal. – Sca (talk) 23:29, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Wait If this gets worse and deadlier, then I will support. Heythereimaguy (talk) 13:02, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Wait per NorthernFalcon & Sca. Modest Genius talk 13:16, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Comment I would further comment that given Port of Vancouver is affected (the fourth largest port in North America by volume of goods) the supply chain issues are pretty notable. [6] CaffeinAddict (talk) 23:11, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, just “affected” the fourth in North America. Not America. Not even in the world. Let's not overestimate it.

(Post) Alternative blurb: ?Russia shoots down Kosmos 1408 with an anti-satellite weapon, creating a field of space debris. Alternative blurb II: ?Kosmos 1408 is destroyed by a Russian anti-satellite weapon and turned into a stream of space debris. News source(s): BBC, AP, Reuters, Guardian, Bloomberg Credits: Nominated by Andrew Davidson (talk · give credit) Created by Mike Peel (talk · give credit) Updated by Smeagol 17 (talk · give credit) Article updated Nominator's comments: We have some real news about the ISS now as the crew have to take shelter from a shower of debris created by a Russian missile test. And the Kessler syndrome advances another notch. What we're mainly missing is a good picture but we might use something generic like this. Andrew?(talk) 12:56, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support in principle, as this is a significant event for the space industry (more so than Crew-3 that we already have on the template). However the article is pretty lightweight and could use some expansion. It also needs a source for the claim that Russia was responsible for the test - we can't claim something in the blurb that isn't cited in the article. I would also remove 'dangerous' from the blurb as that's quite a strong accusation. Modest Genius talk 13:05, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Article seems fine now, though as I was one of the users updating it an independent assessment would be welcome. Modest Genius talk 18:16, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support on the merits; the use of an anti-satellite weapon(even as a test) is rare and few countries possess such technology. Russia isn't denying it. 331dot (talk) 13:10, 16 November 2021 (UTC) @331dot: Yes, the use is rare and few countries possess such technology. Yet, I remember a similar test from India a couple of years ago was rejected as the technology "has been around for a while." If I recall correctly, there had been significant debate about debris back then too. 2405:201:4013:8087:A828:E291:B9B5:4B09 (talk) 18:31, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I can only comment on the nomination in front of me; I can't speak to past ones at this time. 331dot (talk) 19:15, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support in principle though article needs to include that Russia shot it down (right now, the article just says it broke up). And other cn tags in article would need fixing. Though I agree, this is way more important/notable/covered in news sources than Crew-3. Joseph2302 (talk) 13:12, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Comment I started putting this through DYK earlier today, see Template:Did you know nominations/Kosmos 1408, since I haven't enjoyed participating in previous ITN discussions. But if you want this here, then the DYK can be withdrawn. I've updated the template above, since I started the article yesterday. Thanks. Mike Peel (talk) 13:14, 16 November 2021 (UTC) One option would be to merge this into the existing Crew-3 ISS mission blurb. If Kosmos 1408 is not bolded then it can still be a DYK too. Andrew?(talk) 13:22, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I oppose merging those blurbs - these are separate events. Modest Genius talk 14:07, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I also oppose merging- they're separate events, and this one is more important, so shouldn't be stuck on the end of some less important and newswirthy article that's only on the front page because it was alledgedly ITNR (even though that ITNR criteria was demonstrated to be unfit for purpose). And if this does reach front page, then DYK would no longer be eligible, but until that point, don't see a need to withdraw the DYK nom. Joseph2302 (talk) 14:30, 16 November 2021 (UTC) We could remove the Crew-3 blurb and replace it with this one when this is ready to go (assuming Crew-3 is still on ITN). Yeah, it doesn't get its "full time" there, but I agree that it doesn't make sense to merge, but having two ISS-related things could be seen as overwhelming the box. --Masem (t) 14:35, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – Fairly widely covered, but broader significance of a "threat" to the ISS isn't so apparent. – Sca (talk) 13:38, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Even a fleck of paint could seriously damage the ISS, one of the most expensive objects ever constructed. 331dot (talk) 11:14, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support in principle. This is very significant news and an interesting story of high encyclopedic value.--Kiril Simeonovski (talk) 13:41, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support in principle per above, just needs better fleshing out of the article. --Masem (t) 13:53, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – Upon reflection, it seems to be a serious threat all right, but ... can we post something that hasn't had a tangible effect ... yet? – Sca (talk) 14:11, 16 November 2021 (UTC) PS: My question is, did Putin authorize this stupid 'test' – or was it just an act of heedless military apparatchiks down in the bureaucracy? (Russia is an oligarchy that has a country – a country that has an enormous military.) – Sca (talk) 14:19, 16 November 2021 (UTC) The way I'm reading it, the story is more that Russia has appeared to have violated a treaty related to space-bound weapons, in addition to this being a story of interest to space exploration (the potential of damage to the ISS that forced the crew to shelter for at least two orbits as it passed through the debris field). --Masem (t) 14:17, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Reasonable enough. However, the threat to human lives (including two Russians!) seems more compelling in terms of reader interest. – Sca (talk) 14:22, 16 November 2021 (UTC) From our article on the Outer Space Treaty: "Although it forbids establishing military bases, testing weapons and conducting military maneuvers on celestial bodies, the treaty does not expressly ban all military activities in space, nor the establishment of military space forces or the placement of conventional weapons in space". Testing an anti-satellite weapon on your own target is not against any treaty, just regarded as irresponsible. Note that the US, China and India have all conducted similar tests with no legal repercussions or UN censure. Modest Genius talk 15:09, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose no longer fresh, not really in the news, rolled off a while ago and probably better suited for DYK. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 16:11, 16 November 2021 (UTC) What's your time frame for "no longer fresh"? The BBC article is only 12 hours old and the event itself occurred yesterday. It's certainly a newer event than anything currently in the ITN box... --Jayron32 16:16, 16 November 2021 (UTC) (edit conflict) The BBC published two more articles about this story in just the last hour [7] [8]. That seems pretty fresh. Modest Genius talk 16:19, 16 November 2021 (UTC) It happened yesterday, and is very much still in the news. Much more so than the posted blurbs, such as the NYC Marathon on 7 November for example. Joseph2302 (talk) 16:20, 16 November 2021 (UTC) OH sure, you can dig into websites and find more analysis, but it's not headline news and hasn't been for most of the day now. Even the article makes it clear that the "main event" has passed. Biggest headlines in the UK are now that Johnson is proposing to prevent MPs from getting paid consultancy jobs. This story is no longer even on the BBC News homepage. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 16:24, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support Article is short, but sufficient; it seems to have developed some since the earlier notes. Topic is being covered by reliable news sources. --Jayron32 16:17, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose ... for now. Article text comprises 340 words, of which 115 are background, leaving a mere 230 words about the current threat. IMO, too thin for MP promotion. Second, we shouldn't blurb something that hasn't had an impact (yet). – Sca (talk) 17:03, 16 November 2021 (UTC) PS: Given that the current situation could continue for quite some time, perhaps after a bit we should consider posting this directly to Ongoing. – Sca (talk) 17:10, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Whatever political fallout there has been is pretty much so far just a short but important burst (for blurb posting), but there's no sign this is going to escalate into something further, in comparison to the nuclear submarine sale a few months back. --Masem (t) 19:50, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Wait is there a real danger debris hits other satellites soon, or is this just "an abundance of caution"? Will there be significant geo-political ramifications from the test? Until one of those is "yes", I think we should wait. User:? (powera, ?, ?) 19:52, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Everywhere is at risk for disaster, but this info is nothing like disaster actually happening. Political story, and involving two countries who always bicker. Could change if the ISS is destroyed or something stronger than words breaks out. InedibleHulk (talk) 20:46, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Is this an RD nom for the destruction of Kosmos 1408? If so, its "career section" needs an expansion to describe how it was used while still in orbit and operational.--PFHLai (talk) 23:08, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Questionable significance as far as potential impacts, especially given at the moment it is just predictive. I would assume that the test itself is not sufficient for ITN, so I'm on the "Oppose" side here. DarkSide830 (talk) 00:01, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support even if nothing happens to the ISS, ASAT weapon tests don't happen every day, or even every year. Banedon (talk) 03:44, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support Certainly magnitudes more important than the multitude of launches posted every now and then on ITN. Gotitbro (talk) 07:09, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support significant, made the news and the article Kosmos 1408 is short but adequate. Given the military nature of this satellite and its destruction, we can't expect to know that many details. Of the proposed blurbs, only alt 1 is good. --LukeSurl t c 10:02, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support in principle this is a significant story BUT it simply cannot be posted with a blurb of this quality. Its language is misleading and makes it sound as if a functional satellite was attacked, but rather a defunct satellite was destroyed as part of a weapons test... slightly different. Possibly also include the name of the missile system, if known, and replace "Russia" with the actual agency overseeing the test. JMonkey2006 (talk) 11:10, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Feel free to propose a different blurb. Or we could simply add 'defunct' before the name of the satellite. Modest Genius talk 11:38, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – Absent from main RS sites on Wednesday; no longer in the news. Seems a minor issue without tangible effects. Neither target article is really about this event. – Sca (talk) 12:42, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support in principle per JMonkey. Fakescientist8000 (talk) 13:54, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support. The Kessler syndrome may have been triggered: "The Kessler syndrome is troublesome because of the domino effect and feedback runaway wherein impacts between objects of sizable mass spall off debris from the force of the collision. The fragments can then hit other objects, producing even more space debris: if a large enough collision or explosion were to occur, such as between a space station and a defunct satellite, or as the result of hostile actions in space, then the resulting debris cascade could make prospects for long-term viability of satellites in particular low Earth orbits extremely low." Count Iblis (talk) 14:52, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support - Russia is weaponizing space. Whether or not they were the first to do it - and presumably they weren't - this is an indication of a change in global affairs when it comes to outer space.--WaltCip-(talk) 16:16, 17 November 2021 (UTC) If you didn't know (see anti-satellite weapon), the first ASAT test was in 1959, and was conducted by the US. Banedon (talk) 02:06, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Comment any admins around here to post this? I oppose its inclusion as it's already stale in my opinion, but there's a pretty clear consensus here and the longer it's left unposted, the staler it becomes....

The election comission has announced that We Continue the Change has won most seats, so therefore such a nomination can now be made. As we have posted the winner in the previous elections, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:In_the_news/Candidates/July_2021#(Posted)_Bulgarian_parliamentary_election. They are a new party too, so surprising. I have added a result synopsis and started the aftermath. Good article, have spent a lot of time on it myself with a few others. BastianMAT (talk) 14:45, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Support Article has minimum of prose describing the leadup, results, and aftermath. More writing would be nice, but it's passable for the main page. Everything is referenced and it has prose, which is more than can be said for many of the nominations of this type. --Jayron32 12:01, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: Is it time to start the English wikibio for the other co-leader of We Continue the Change, Asen Vasilev? The coalition has two leaders, not just Petkov. Do we want to wait till a government is formed? --PFHLai (talk) 12:01, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I guess yeah, he deserves one too, but Petkov is the primary focus here as he is the one seeking to become prime minister (per https://www.euronews.com/2021/11/14/bulgarian-elections-newly-formed-pp-party-neck-and-neck-with-right-wing-gerb-party). The truth is we don't even know yet if they will be successful forming a goverment, but we posted both the Czech party SPOLU and the last Bulgarian election when ITN won the most seats as the election itself is ITNR, so going by that this nomination/blurb should be suitable to make it out to the front page.BastianMAT (talk) 12:17, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support Article is in great shape. I think the easiest way to solve what PFHLai exposes is to put in the blurb that Petkov is the "co-leader", thus making it understood that he is not the only one leading the coalition. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 12:42, 16 November 2021 (UTC) How about not mentioning either co-leaders in the blurb? (See alt1) I'm not sure about using the proposed photo of Petkov on MainPage, anyway. --PFHLai (talk) 22:40, 16 November 2021 (UTC) We can do that too if there are any issues with the image, no problem.

Remember, go for it!. Fakescientist8000 (talk) 15:19, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Comment I wanted to nominate this but hasitated. Are these midterms considered general elections? Half of the seats in the lower chamber and 1/3 of the upper chamber are up for election and our article defines general elections as "elections in which all or most members of a political body are chosen." Scaramouche33 (talk) 16:16, 15 November 2021 (UTC) I half-wondered if such "mid-term" elections were covered by ITNR. If they are, perhaps that should also be explicitly noted at ITNR. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 16:19, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Yeah, mid terms elections are part of it, it is notable too as the ruling party have lost their majority. Here is the US one that was also posted. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:In_the_news/Candidates/November_2018#(Posted)_2018_US_Midterm_Elections.BastianMAT (talk) 16:28, 15 November 2021 (UTC) But that was mainly because it involved "all or most members of a political body are chosen". This doesn't appear to be the case here. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 16:44, 15 November 2021 (UTC) It depends on how you see on it. The mid term senate elections in US only feature 34 members up running for election. In Argentina it was half of the congress and enough for an significant change in both political bodies (ruling party losing control of both the house and the senate).BastianMAT (talk) 16:53, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Well it doesn't matter what happened in the US, how does this meet the requirements at ITNR? The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 16:59, 15 November 2021 (UTC) From what I understand, in the US midterms all House seats+1/3 of Senate seats were up for election so that would be considered as "most members of an electoral body" but here it's only half. Does that still count as general elections? If so it's ITN/R, if not who knows. Scaramouche33 (talk) 17:14, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Yeah I agree, it is arguable for both sides. At least based on this, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midterm_election, Argentina[1] (legislative and local election) falls under the heading General elections (which makes it ITNR) alongside the United States (legislative and local election) which was posted.BastianMAT (talk) 17:17, 15 November 2021 (UTC) I'm not sure it is arguable here, it doesn't meet the definition in ITNR and it's a mid-term, not a general election by any normal definition (despite what "Wikipedia" might say). The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 17:30, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – First four grafs back into the results and seem needlessly complex. – Sca (talk) 17:19, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Comment the table in the infobox violates MOS:COLHEAD by having column headers in the middle of the table.

Martinevans123 (talk) 18:40, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. Failed attack which caused one injury and killed the attacker. It's not clear what the target was or who it was supposed to terrorise. If this hadn't been declared a terrorist incident it would be minor local news. I encourage the existing DYK nom instead. Modest Genius talk 19:02, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Regardless of terrorism tag, I suspect this would have been national news. But of course, we will never know. The fact is it is big national news. Martinevans123 (talk) 19:07, 16 November 2021 (UTC) But it was declared a terrorist attack, which adds notability to the incident. Jbvann05 20:32, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Not really, it just grants the police additional powers and generates more headlines. The actual event doesn't become any worse.

Martinevans123 (talk) 21:05, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you for your answer because clearly I've realized that I have not expressed myself well. I mean that at the time, the reason why I've opposed was the same used by other users (who have not participated in this debate, except Modest Genius) to not support the cited nomination in September. That is why I am frankly surprised. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 21:29, 16 November 2021 (UTC) BLP Caution One suspect is dead, but four others are arrested in connection; might want to attribute this "attempted terrorist bombing" instead of stating it as a fact Wikipedia knows (a "declaration" from police is still an allegation).

Norman Butkiss 123 (talk) 22:47, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. I will admit to perhaps being more jaded to bomb stories than some other nationalities may be, but even with that notwithstanding, I don't believe we'd be considering an attack which killed no victims and injured one if it took place elsewhere (we recently didn't post, for example, an attack that targeted but didn't kill a head of state). That isn't necessarily to say there's any deliberate bias here but it's important to remember that England has a well-developed media sphere and any regional story will have a lot of domestic coverage, but we are not necessarily beholden to repeat their biases. For reference, even the BBC have displaced this story in favour of the latest update in a racism dispute in county cricket. ??????? ? 21:46, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support major incident, leading news story, article decent.

Gotitbro (talk) 07:12, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose as the investigation has not been completed and it has not been confirmed yet whether it was terrorism, whether the detonation was intentional or accidental, or who the intended victim or victims might to have been.

Opinion is generally permitted if it's clearly attributed? Thanks. Martinevans123 (talk) 11:21, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Very Strong Oppose Per WP:Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, we are supposed to be an encyclopedia, and we are NOT supposed to be a dangerous free publicity machine for every murderous suicidal nutter, still less for every would-be terrorist and every terrorist organisation. So a terrorist incident should be truly exceptional and notable before appearing on our front page, all the more so as it is often liable to remain there giving dangerous free publicity (and thus in practice encouragement) to terrorists and other murderous nutters long after it has disappeared from the front pages of other mainstream Western news outlets (as many terrorists probably already realize, even if many editors around here seemingly don't). There is NOTHING in this incident that gives it the required exceptionality and notability to justify the danger this poses to innocent people, as well as the damage it might (rightly in my view) do to our reputation. Tlhslobus (talk) 18:15, 17 November 2021 (UTC) See WP:RIGHTGREATWRONGS. Your diatribe is interesting, but nothing to do with ITNC, otherwise we'd never publish another mass shooting in the US ever again. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 18:27, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose No lasting effect plus terrible disjointed article means it's a No from me, Bob. Black Kite (talk) 18:23, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose The story stopped trending yesterday, and the death/injury toll is very low (luckily). If attacks of this kind were rare in the UK I would be willing to overlook these factors, but (unfortunately) there's been a seemingly-steady uptick in the last couple of years, so there's nothing about this that makes it stand out. Mount Patagonia (talk) 18:27, 17 November 2021 (UTC) But the satellite blow-up stopped trending 36 hours ago and no-one died. Terror attacks where bombs are ignited on Remembrance Day are few and far between, I'm sure you can point me to the last time that happened, right? The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 18:29, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I was referencing upticks in UK-based terror attacks in general, not ones falling on Rememberance Day. If terror attacks that fell on special occasions were automatic shoe-ins, then last year's Christmas bombing in Nashville would have been posted, but it wasn't for the same reasons I'm opposing posting this story. For the Russian satellite, take it up with the people for voted for it because I had no involvement in that decision. Mount Patagonia (talk) 22:06, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Indeed, terror attacks often happen on supposedly significant days or dates (sometimes perhaps coincidentally, sometimes perhaps as part of an attempt to increase the attack's psychological impact, or perhaps sometimes for quasi-religious reasons). Not only do we not use this as an excuse to put it into ITN, we sometimes leave it out of the article as well. For instance it was 5 years before Wikipedia mentioned that the Bataclan attacks occurred on Friday the 13th and there is still no link from it to the article about the superstition, presumably because RS don't mention such a link (perhaps to avoid making vulnerable people more fearful or otherwise psychologically distressed or harmed whenever 'significant' dates approach). Tlhslobus (talk) 15:33, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Comment we don't need to name the perp in any of the blurbs. That's totally undue. Get a grip people. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 18:30, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I've been bold and removed the name of the perp. We don't need that, even if this isn't posted, anywhere near this encyclopedia. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 20:17, 17 November 2021 (UTC) The name of the perpetrator is encyclopedic and should be in the article; but I agree that it should not be posted in ITN regardless. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 00:14, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose No victims and unclear / unorganised motive. Belugsump (talk) 03:44, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – Limited significance. No longer in the news. – Sca (talk) 13:06, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose.

This should be fixed before it's posted on the main page.  — Amakuru (talk) 17:17, 15 November 2021 (UTC) MOS:DTAB is a laudable goal, but not one of the WP:ITNCRIT. It's probably moot though, as no improvements to the article have been made in the last 3 days. Modest Genius talk 11:36, 17 November 2021 (UTC) While articles on topics such as sporting events and economics lend themselves to tables of numbers, updates must be at least in part written in prose to qualify for ITN consideration. That isn't the case here, as the section in question is using ugly nested tables rather than prose (like I suggested doing days ago).

References[edit] Nominators often include links to external websites and other references in discussions on this page. It is usually best to provide such links using the inline URL syntax [http://example.com] rather than using <ref></ref> tags, because that keeps all the relevant information in the same place as the nomination without having to jump to this section, and facilitates the archiving process.

Please read the guidelines. Admin instructions are here. ??Skip to suggestions In the news toolbox Error reports Nominations (Archives) Discussion General criteria Death criteria Recurring items Admin guide Image protection Current events portal v t e Shortcut WP:ITN/C This page provides a forum for editors to suggest items for inclusion on In the news (ITN), a protected template on the Main Page, as well as the forum for discussion of candidates. This is not the page to report errors in the ITN section on the Main Page—please go to the appropriate section at WP:ERRORS. Archives of past nominations can be found here. This candidates page is integrated with the daily pages of Portal:Current events. Under each daily section header below is the transcluded Portal:Current events items for that day (with a light green header). Each day's portal page is followed by a subsection for suggestions and discussion. A blurb is a one sentence summary of the news story. An alternate suggestion for the blurb is called an altblurb, and any more suggestions get labelled alt1, alt2, etc. A blurb needs at least one target article, highlighted in bold; reviewers check the quality of that article and whether it is updated, and whether reliable sources demonstrate the significance of the event. Other articles can also be linked. The Ongoing line is for regularly updated articles which cover events that remain in the news over a longer period of time. RD stands for the "recent deaths" line, and can include any living thing whose death was recently announced. In some cases, recent deaths may need additional explanation as provided by a blurb; this is decided by consensus.

Sterling Cary Edgardo Labella Sam Huff Dzifa Attivor Young Dolph Julio Lugo Nominate an article view — page history — related changes — edit How to nominate an item[edit] In order to suggest a candidate: Update an article to be linked to from the blurb to include the recent developments, or find an article that has already been updated. Find the correct section below for the date of the event (not the date nominated). Do not add sections for new dates. These are automatically generated (at midnight UTC) by a bot; creating them manually breaks this process. Nominate the blurb for ITN inclusion under the "Suggestions" subheading for the date, emboldening the link in the blurb to the updated article. Use a level 4 header (====) when doing so. Preferably use the template {{ITN candidate}} to nominate the article related to the event in the news. Make sure that you include a reference from a verifiable, reliable secondary source. Press releases are not acceptable. The suggested blurb should be written in simple present tense. Adding an explanation why the event should be posted greatly increases the odds of posting. Please consider alerting editors to the nomination by adding the template {{ITN note}} to the corresponding article's talk page. Purge this page to update the cache There are criteria which guide the decision on whether or not to put a particular item on In the news, based largely on the extensiveness of the updated content and the perceived significance of the recent developments. These are listed at WP:ITN. Submissions that do not follow the guidelines at Wikipedia:In the news will not be placed onto the live template. Headers[edit] Items that have been posted or pulled from the main page are generally marked with (Posted) or (Pulled) in the item's subject so it is clear they are no longer active. Items can also be marked as (Ready) when the article is both updated and there seems to be a consensus to post. The posting admin, however, should always judge the update and the consensus to post themselves. If you find an entry that you don't feel is ready to post is marked (Ready), you should remove the mark in the header. Voicing an opinion on an item[edit] Format your comment to contain "support" or "oppose", and include a rationale for your choice. In particular, address the notability of the event, the quality of the article, and whether it has been updated. Please do not...[edit] add simple "support!" or "oppose!" votes without including your reasons. Similarly, curt replies such as "who?", "meh", or "duh!" are usually not helpful. Instead, explain the reasons why you think the item meets or does not meet the ITN inclusion criteria so a consensus can be reached. oppose an item because the event is only relating to a single country, or failing to relate to one. This applies to a high percentage of the content we post and is unproductive. accuse other editors of supporting, opposing or nominating due to a personal bias (such as ethnocentrism). Conflicts of interest are not handled at ITN. comment on a story without first reading the relevant article(s). oppose a recurring item here because you disagree with the recurring items criteria. The criteria can be discussed at the relevant talk page.

Article: Peng Shuai (talk · history · tag) Blurb: ?Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai disappears after accusing a former Chinese Vice Premier of sexual assault. (Post) Alternative blurb: ?Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai is reported missing after accusing former Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli of sexual assault. News source(s): Guardian Credits: Nominated by Blythwood (talk · give credit) Article updatedNominator's comments: Seems to be a forced disappearance. This is a bit unusual, but has been a major news story. Disappearance section seems solid but the rest of the article on her career is less well sourced. The person has disappeared without a trace, so while it cannot be verified that this person person has died or been imprisoned, her disappearance is in itself the notable event. I wonder if this could be treated as something like the equivalent of a recent death. Blythwood (talk) 22:39, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support - Article is in good condition and the news is prominent, exceptional, and of great public interest around the world. Jehochman Talk 22:45, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose - Article appear in news, but headlines on CBC, CNN, BBC are still focused on Rittenhouse Trial for now, although this may change. Otherwise, the blurb should describe whats happening now (the reactions), that she has not been publicly heard is not ITN as that is a few days old. 99.247.176.90 (talk) 23:06, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose - I fail to see how this is any more worthy of ITN than the Rittenhouse trial, which was also not worthy of ITN. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 23:10, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Please don't oppose because you think another nomination should be posted and you don't think this one is as worthy. Judge nomination on its own merit. The two are about completely different things. -- KTC (talk) 23:12, 19 November 2021 (UTC) I don't think either are worthy of being posted. --RockstoneSend me a message! 01:20, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support per Jehochman. However I'm not quite sure about the term "disappears" here, even if I personally think the Chinese state did exactly that. -- KTC (talk) 23:16, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support per Jehochman. -- Tavix (talk) 23:20, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support this is far more notable than "another white American kills black Americans" and regardless of the fact that headlines are currently obsessing over the US proclivity to allow kids to routinely assassinate people without any kind of criminal conviction, Peng's disappearance is genuinely newsworthy and encyclopedic. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 23:23, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Not that it matters to this nomination, but Rittenhouse's victims were white. GreatCaesarsGhost 00:04, 20 November 2021 (UTC) *cough cough* Rittenhouse's victims were white *cough cough* – John M Wolfson (talk • contribs) 00:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Who said he wasn't talking about Young Dolph's routine assassin? We don't know he wasn't white. We don't know if he had other black American victims. Memphis is all about unsolved mysteries! AGF. InedibleHulk (talk) 02:06, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose on quality The article needs a lot of work, as there are multiple sections with no inline citations.Pawnkingthree (talk) 23:42, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support While this might be unduly implicative of the Chinese state being connected, if RSs are making that connection this definitely belongs. – John M Wolfson (talk • contribs) 00:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose on quality I would support this if the article has some ref work done. There's sections that are unsourced. --TDKR Chicago 101 (talk) 00:34, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose this is newsworthy for sure but blurbing that someone "disappeared" after making an accusation seems like a WP:BLPCRIME issue to me. --LaserLegs (talk) 00:39, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Completely agree it's an awkward thing to summarise in a way that fits BLP while keeping it clear why the event is notable, I'd welcome suggestions for alternative phrasing. I realise this is a fairly limited action, but for that reason I deliberately didn't link to the person she accused in the proposed blurb. Blythwood (talk) 01:57, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose as per LaserLegs, there's something wrong about posting speculation that someone disappeared straight after they made accusations. With little reliable information, this seems like a BLP issue to post it. Joseph2302 (talk) 01:47, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Far too speculative, with overtones of anti-China sentiment, and with too many unknowns. Needs far more clarification before it is posted. And a guarantee that ITN will publish a full We Were Wrong! statement and retraction on the Main page when it is found out she has just eloped with her boyfriend or girlfriend, as the case may be. HiLo48 (talk) 01:55, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Clearly if China "disappeared" her, that would be a story, but this appears to be Western nations making a demand of China and there's no hard evidence she has been killed or imprisoned or the like. We don't post this type of speculative stories. --Masem (t) 02:16, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support Per wide coverage in RSes. Normchou?? 03:22, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose unless the incident has a separate article. Sun8908?Talk 07:38, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support — article looks decent enough for ITN standards by my eye, wide coverage in RSes. If the choice of "disappears" is undesirable, then "is reported missing" might be a potential alternative (posted as altblurb). [osunpokeh/talk/contributions] 08:41, 20 November 2021 (UTC) I think that suggests she was reported missing in the police report sense, not that Novak Djokovic described her as "a missing person" to reporters. Not a bad idea. Just a bit ambiguous. InedibleHulk (talk) 09:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Strong support, in the news, top page news in many countries. The issue is she has suddenly disappeared after accusing a senior cabinet minister of a serious crime, and the involved parties are public figures indept of this incident, so there is nothing wrong as long as it is sourced and not stated as truth. Peng's disappearance and the resulting sports diplomacy pressure and boycott threats are sufficient Bumbubookworm (talk) 12:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Have you ever studied the difference between correlation and causation? HiLo48 (talk) 21:48, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Yes I have and I wonder if it's possible to have a maths competition over Wikipedia lol. I never said there was a causation, although I am sure many on Wikipedia have noted your hard-left POV eg trying to get all right of centre Australian newspapers struck off at RSN. Bumbubookworm (talk) 22:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Applause. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:33, 20 November 2021 (UTC) I am adding sources to the career section Bumbubookworm (talk) 12:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – Per Masem, Joseph2302. Something that may have happened isn't blurbworthy, no matter how widely it's hyped. – Sca (talk) 13:05, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose per Masem, Sca. It could be the start of something noteworthy, or it could be nothing. We can post when it turns out to be something noteworthy if it does. Usedtobecool ?? 13:23, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support - Do we post news around here anymore? Sometimes I do wonder.--WaltCip-(talk) 18:40, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support highly notable, good article. Polyamorph (talk) 20:03, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support per above. The article has unref'd sections about her tennis career, but the linked section is ready. Davey2116 (talk) 21:52, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. We shouldn't (and don't) post articles with multiple unsourced sections. The fact that the section linked in bold is referenced is irrelevant. Black Kite (talk) 23:26, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Wait Let's wait until we are 100% sure what has happened to her. Heythereimaguy (talk) 23:53, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Global Times continues to point to her, this time at a restaurant with a coach and friends, seemingly quite visible. Western speculation now turns to whether she's safe, though, or free from external interference or to be believed. All very personal and hard-to-answer questions, for anybody anywhere. InedibleHulk (talk) 00:10, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose it's just one person in a world where much worse things happen in other places like Ethiopia. Banedon (talk) 01:11, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose for now. Videos of Peng Shuai have supposedly surfaced. Nice4What (talk · contribs) – (Thanks ?) 03:30, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Support However, I propose removing the term 'Chinese' in front of Peng Shuai. It does not add to her character or her identity as a professional tennis player. Something along the lines of "Professional tennis player Peng Shuai disappears after accusing former Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli of sexual assault." would be better imo. However, we should also note the videos posted by Global Times editors (primarily those tweeted by editor-in-chief Hu Xijin) and their aftermath. JMonkey2006 (talk) 11:10, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – She's reappeared, online at least. End of story? – Sca (talk) 13:34, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Strong support Wide coverage by RSes and notable. Fakescientist8000 (talk) 14:05, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Still too murky and speculative, with little general impact. – Sca (talk) 15:24, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Leaving aside anything else, there is video evidence of her out and about so she hasn't been "disappeared" and isn't "missing". Whether or not something else is happening is in the realm of speculation, and would require a separate blurb. Also, very large swathes of the article on her career lack even a single citation. Is it not time to close this as no consensus already? Preceding posted by User:BSMRD – Sca (talk) 17:35, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: – Discussion tops 1,500 words. Posts running 4:3 against posting. – Sca (talk) 17:42, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Comment as nominator I'm willing to close soon now there's video of her alive (barring any big development, like it rapidly emerging this is an impersonator). Someone being in big trouble with their government isn't ITN-worthy, although I still think someone being forced-disappeared could be.

A few WP:PROSELINE-issues, but not enough to downgrade the quality too much. Topic has been, and is being covered extensively by quality, reliable news sources in a way that would indicate this is a significant story. Checks all of the boxes for me. --Jayron32 18:55, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose to international notability. It won’t be listed on 2021 per previous discussions of it not having international notability. Elijahandskip (talk) 19:02, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Elijahandskip, #Please do not... oppose an item because the event is only relating to a single country, or failing to relate to one. This applies to a high percentage of the content we post and is unproductive. – Muboshgu (talk) 19:04, 19 November 2021 (UTC) (edit conflict):*See the instructions above "Please do not...oppose an item because the event is only relating to a single country, or failing to relate to one. This applies to a high percentage of the content we post and is unproductive." "International notability" is not a criteria for posting at ITN, nor has it ever been. --Jayron32 19:05, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Well my direct opinion is that it is not notable. My reasoning is the discussion that already took place on the 2021 talk page. I also have previous discussions months ago where things highly notable to one country aren’t included. Elijahandskip (talk) 19:11, 19 November 2021 (UTC) This is not a discussion of the page 2021. The criteria established for other parts of Wikipedia don't apply here. If you wish to change the criteria used for the ITN box, then start a discussion at WT:ITN. Votes without valid rationales are given little weight. It's fine if you have a useful rationale, but merely "I don't think it's notable enough" does not provide any useful guidance to admins when deciding consensus. I mean, you're allowed to say any silly thing you want, I suppose, but you can't expect anyone to take you seriously if it isn't valid. --Jayron32 19:18, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Well since you don’t like my reasoning, just let me say “no”. People have supported ITN’s in the past without giving a reason, so my “Oppose” in this case will not have a reason. Elijahandskip (talk) 19:22, 19 November 2021 (UTC) As I said, it's a free world. People do nonsensical things all of the time. --Jayron32 19:24, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Yep, I couldn’t agree more. In reality, my oppose on this comes more to combat American Wikipedia vs English Wikipedia. There is a essay on Wikipedia that I recently read that has that meaning. Not everything that happens in America is notable for Wikipedia/2021/ITN/Portal Current Events, etc….Elijahandskip (talk) 19:34, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose (at least on news of just the verdict). It was a highly watched case in the U.S., but it was clear early on to many legal experts that are crying foul on judicial behavior. It is very very likely to see an appeal and so this is not the end. This is not like the result from the very public George Floyd protests (which we posted and had ongoing about those, and the verdict). That said, there had been concerns there may be rioting following an acquittal , and while I'm not seeing any immediate news on that, a major riot (akin to the LA riots after King's verdict) would likely be the newsworthy factor here. --Masem (t) 19:05, 19 November 2021 (UTC) There literally cannot be any appeal of a not guilty verdict. This is a core principle of how double jeopardy is handled in American jurisprudence. A not guilty jury verdict is basically always final. See [1]. There are some exceedingly rare exceptions to this, but none of them would apply in this case. An ordinary jury verdict of "not guilty" like this one (even in a controversial trial) is treated as basically sacrosanct, and there can be no appeals by the government. --Jayron32 19:08, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Except for the calls for a mistrial that are being entered now. I know there's complexities with double jeopardy there, but that's still on the books and that itself can be a legal process. --Masem (t) 19:15, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Um, what? There were calls for a mistrial by Rittenhouse's defense team prior to the jury verdict coming back. Now that the verdict is in their client's favor, I doubt highly they will press forward with these requests. Indeed, articles such as this one note "The verdict also meant that Judge Bruce Schroeder did not have to rule on the defense's motions for a mistrial." --Jayron32 19:23, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose as above. If we had to have an American court psychodrama today, the better option from a world-historical perspective would probably be the acquittal of the purported killers of Malcolm X. —Brigade Piron (talk) 19:20, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose AGF, but this is such a small story in the grand scheme. GreatCaesarsGhost 19:23, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Wait. It is too early to tell what impact this will have. It could be a Rodney King-like result where acquittal of the accused leads to broad social unrest, or it could pass with a shrug. I expect that we will know within 24 hours. BD2412 T 19:30, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose and close US-centric nomination, not important enough for ITN.

Far from blurb-worthy, lack of deep international coverage and interest. U.S-centric. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 19:58, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Very US centric. It's probably not even the most important news in the US right now, let alone the world. I agree with Piron above that the clearing of Malcom X's killers is more noteworthy in the grand scheme. CaptainEek Edits Ho Cap'n!? 20:32, 19 November 2021 (UTC) It is the most important US news event ongoing right now.

(Post) News source(s): AP, WSJ Credits: Nominated by Indefensible (talk · give credit) Updated by Dracophyllum (talk · give credit) and DiplomatTesterMan (talk · give credit) Nominator's comments: This article was previously in ongoing, now has a noteworthy update which should bring it towards conclusion. - Indefensible (talk) 06:50, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: One of the major farmers' unions behind the protests, Bharatiya Kisan Union, has promised to continue protesting till the laws are actually repealed (source). I wonder if we should put this blurb up now, or when Parliament repeals them and the farmers go home (don't have strong opinions either way, but I lean towards waiting). If we're going to put it up now, I've uploaded this screengrab of Modi's announcement from his CC-BY YouTube channel; we could use it. Btw Indefensible - Dracophyllum was the only updater, not DiplomatTesterMan. Kind regards, W. Tell DCCXLVI (talk to me!/c) 07:05, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Using the update to put back in ongoing instead of a final blurb would be fine too if preferable. And DiplomatTesterMan did more updates on the article before that, he still deserves some credit too I think. - Indefensible (talk) 07:12, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose because the article is not sufficiently updated. There is currently a 1 sentence mention in the lead of the repeal of the laws, and no mention of it, nor of any follow-on protests, anywhere in the body of the article. Before this can be posted, the latest developments would need to be added to the article appropriately. --Jayron32 12:18, 19 November 2021 (UTC) @Jayron32 Have you read the repeal section? Dracophyllum 20:10, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Your response is 8 hours after Jayron32's, Dracophyllum. The section may have not existed when Jayron commented. But then again, I am not going to take the time to check if it did exist at 12:18 PM UTC on 19 Nov 2021. Tube·of·Light 02:30, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: The announcement by itself has no legal value. Parliament has to repeal the laws, which it will probably do in the coming Winter Session. Also some farmer's unions are continuing protests until the laws are repealed and minimum support prices reconsidered. So it might be better to wait, but no strong opinion either way. --Jose Mathew (talk) 12:24, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Wait and see what the impact of this is. Right now, there isn't enough information on what will happen as a result of this.

India-centric nomination, not important enough for ITN and renominate once the riots get into full swing. per above. Far from blurb-worthy, lack of deep international coverage and interest. India-centric Very India centric. It's probably not even the most important news in India right now, let alone the world. Actually not even sure this is going to be more than a couple days' news in India "Please do not oppose an item because the event is only relating to a single country, or failing to relate to one. This applies to a high percentage of the content we post and is unproductive." 331dot (talk) 23:11, 19 November 2021 (UTC) It's important to remember that 1/7 of the people on this planet are Indians. We don’t post a great deal of India related stories. 331dot (talk) 23:13, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Interestingly I didn't see the same PDM feedback from you above for another "country-centric" nomination from the worlds third most populous country. In fact, we do post many India-centric stories here, this one having festered in ongoing for nearly a year. --LaserLegs (talk) 23:36, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support. Invariably it is announcements that get more attention than the actual act, most of the time(we post elections when the result is known, not when the results are official/certified). If Modi renegs, that will likely be newsworthy itself. 331dot (talk) 23:16, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Weak oppose - as Wilhelm Tell DCCXLVI says, the BKU is still protesting. I would prefer waiting till the laws are actually repealed (and FWIW, these laws are being repealed just before the 2022 Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly elections and elections in some other states, which are crucial for Modi's political party). Tube·of·Light 02:30, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – On article quality – and as others have noted because the laws haven't taken effect. The article, at more than 10,000 words, is grossly overwritten, overblown and overweight – presumably by partisans who view the topic as a cause célèbre that calls for a crusade. – Sca (talk) 13:20, 20 November 2021 (UTC) (Closed) November 2021 lunar eclipse[edit] Consensus will not develop to post this.

The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 21:41, 19 November 2021 (UTC) You're forgetting that lunar eclipses often presage globally cataclysmic events, such as permanent cancellation of The Boat Race, which I fear may now be in the offing for 2022. – Sca (talk) 13:30, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Of course, lunar eclipses and the Boat Race are entirely unrelated. And of course, there will be no "permanent cancellation of The Boat Race", that's total bollocks, but perhaps inline with your regular contributions. As you perhaps should know already, The Boat Race 2022 is scheduled for next year, and if COVID stymies it, one imagines it will simply be moved to the River Great Ouse once again. I'm unclear as to where you think that a lunar eclipse would be a portent for the permanent cancellation of an event which has been conducted since 1829, even before the Third Reich failed to play nicely. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 17:56, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Ease up, Ramblo, it was a joke.

If I recall correctly, I think we did post the 2013 Alberta floods, for precedent. Connormah (talk) 22:39, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I guess "could be" is key here. If it does become the most expensive natural disaster after electing Trudeau in the history of Canada, then it's well placed for a blurb. Maybe now is premature. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:42, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Wait Living through this, it's a pretty devastating disaster, with all road access cut off to and from the Port of Vancouver, which is having a major impact on supply chains across Western Canada. But I don't think this meets the standard previously set for ITN just yet, although there are reports that the death toll is expected to rise. There's also reports of an imminent dike breach into a large city. As such, I'd suggest that we wait.

And the Kessler syndrome advances another notch. What we're mainly missing is a good picture but we might use something generic like this. Andrew?(talk) 12:56, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support in principle, as this is a significant event for the space industry (more so than Crew-3 that we already have on the template). However the article is pretty lightweight and could use some expansion. It also needs a source for the claim that Russia was responsible for the test - we can't claim something in the blurb that isn't cited in the article. I would also remove 'dangerous' from the blurb as that's quite a strong accusation. Modest Genius talk 13:05, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Article seems fine now, though as I was one of the users updating it an independent assessment would be welcome. Modest Genius talk 18:16, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support on the merits; the use of an anti-satellite weapon(even as a test) is rare and few countries possess such technology. Russia isn't denying it. 331dot (talk) 13:10, 16 November 2021 (UTC) @331dot: Yes, the use is rare and few countries possess such technology. Yet, I remember a similar test from India a couple of years ago was rejected as the technology "has been around for a while." If I recall correctly, there had been significant debate about debris back then too. 2405:201:4013:8087:A828:E291:B9B5:4B09 (talk) 18:31, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I can only comment on the nomination in front of me; I can't speak to past ones at this time. 331dot (talk) 19:15, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support in principle though article needs to include that Russia shot it down (right now, the article just says it broke up). And other cn tags in article would need fixing. Though I agree, this is way more important/notable/covered in news sources than Crew-3. Joseph2302 (talk) 13:12, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Comment I started putting this through DYK earlier today, see Template:Did you know nominations/Kosmos 1408, since I haven't enjoyed participating in previous ITN discussions. But if you want this here, then the DYK can be withdrawn. I've updated the template above, since I started the article yesterday. Thanks. Mike Peel (talk) 13:14, 16 November 2021 (UTC) One option would be to merge this into the existing Crew-3 ISS mission blurb. If Kosmos 1408 is not bolded then it can still be a DYK too. Andrew?(talk) 13:22, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I oppose merging those blurbs - these are separate events. Modest Genius talk 14:07, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I also oppose merging- they're separate events, and this one is more important, so shouldn't be stuck on the end of some less important and newswirthy article that's only on the front page because it was alledgedly ITNR (even though that ITNR criteria was demonstrated to be unfit for purpose). And if this does reach front page, then DYK would no longer be eligible, but until that point, don't see a need to withdraw the DYK nom. Joseph2302 (talk) 14:30, 16 November 2021 (UTC) We could remove the Crew-3 blurb and replace it with this one when this is ready to go (assuming Crew-3 is still on ITN). Yeah, it doesn't get its "full time" there, but I agree that it doesn't make sense to merge, but having two ISS-related things could be seen as overwhelming the box. --Masem (t) 14:35, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – Fairly widely covered, but broader significance of a "threat" to the ISS isn't so apparent. – Sca (talk) 13:38, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Even a fleck of paint could seriously damage the ISS, one of the most expensive objects ever constructed. 331dot (talk) 11:14, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support in principle.

(Russia is an oligarchy that has a country – a country that has an enormous military.) – Sca (talk) 14:19, 16 November 2021 (UTC) The way I'm reading it, the story is more that Russia has appeared to have violated a treaty related to space-bound weapons, in addition to this being a story of interest to space exploration (the potential of damage to the ISS that forced the crew to shelter for at least two orbits as it passed through the debris field). --Masem (t) 14:17, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Reasonable enough. However, the threat to human lives (including two Russians!) seems more compelling in terms of reader interest. – Sca (talk) 14:22, 16 November 2021 (UTC) From our article on the Outer Space Treaty: "Although it forbids establishing military bases, testing weapons and conducting military maneuvers on celestial bodies, the treaty does not expressly ban all military activities in space, nor the establishment of military space forces or the placement of conventional weapons in space". Testing an anti-satellite weapon on your own target is not against any treaty, just regarded as irresponsible.

Modest Genius talk 15:09, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose no longer fresh, not really in the news, rolled off a while ago and probably better suited for DYK. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 16:11, 16 November 2021 (UTC) What's your time frame for "no longer fresh"? The BBC article is only 12 hours old and the event itself occurred yesterday. It's certainly a newer event than anything currently in the ITN box... --Jayron32 16:16, 16 November 2021 (UTC) (edit conflict) The BBC published two more articles about this story in just the last hour [7] [8]. That seems pretty fresh. Modest Genius talk 16:19, 16 November 2021 (UTC) It happened yesterday, and is very much still in the news. Much more so than the posted blurbs, such as the NYC Marathon on 7 November for example. Joseph2302 (talk) 16:20, 16 November 2021 (UTC) OH sure, you can dig into websites and find more analysis, but it's not headline news and hasn't been for most of the day now. Even the article makes it clear that the "main event" has passed. Biggest headlines in the UK are now that Johnson is proposing to prevent MPs from getting paid consultancy jobs. This story is no longer even on the BBC News homepage. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 16:24, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support Article is short, but sufficient; it seems to have developed some since the earlier notes. Topic is being covered by reliable news sources. --Jayron32 16:17, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose ... for now. Article text comprises 340 words, of which 115 are background, leaving a mere 230 words about the current threat. IMO, too thin for MP promotion. Second, we shouldn't blurb something that hasn't had an impact (yet). – Sca (talk) 17:03, 16 November 2021 (UTC) PS: Given that the current situation could continue for quite some time, perhaps after a bit we should consider posting this directly to Ongoing. – Sca (talk) 17:10, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Whatever political fallout there has been is pretty much so far just a short but important burst (for blurb posting), but there's no sign this is going to escalate into something further, in comparison to the nuclear submarine sale a few months back. --Masem (t) 19:50, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Wait is there a real danger debris hits other satellites soon, or is this just "an abundance of caution"? Will there be significant geo-political ramifications from the test? Until one of those is "yes", I think we should wait. User:? (powera, ?, ?) 19:52, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Everywhere is at risk for disaster, but this info is nothing like disaster actually happening. Political story, and involving two countries who always bicker. Could change if the ISS is destroyed or something stronger than words breaks out. InedibleHulk (talk) 20:46, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Is this an RD nom for the destruction of Kosmos 1408? If so, its "career section" needs an expansion to describe how it was used while still in orbit and operational.--PFHLai (talk) 23:08, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Questionable significance as far as potential impacts, especially given at the moment it is just predictive. I would assume that the test itself is not sufficient for ITN, so I'm on the "Oppose" side here. DarkSide830 (talk) 00:01, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support even if nothing happens to the ISS, ASAT weapon tests don't happen every day, or even every year. Banedon (talk) 03:44, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support Certainly magnitudes more important than the multitude of launches posted every now and then on ITN. Gotitbro (talk) 07:09, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support significant, made the news and the article Kosmos 1408 is short but adequate. Given the military nature of this satellite and its destruction, we can't expect to know that many details. Of the proposed blurbs, only alt 1 is good. --LukeSurl t c 10:02, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support in principle this is a significant story BUT it simply cannot be posted with a blurb of this quality. Its language is misleading and makes it sound as if a functional satellite was attacked, but rather a defunct satellite was destroyed as part of a weapons test... slightly different. Possibly also include the name of the missile system, if known, and replace "Russia" with the actual agency overseeing the test. JMonkey2006 (talk) 11:10, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Feel free to propose a different blurb. Or we could simply add 'defunct' before the name of the satellite. Modest Genius talk 11:38, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – Absent from main RS sites on Wednesday; no longer in the news. Seems a minor issue without tangible effects. Neither target article is really about this event. – Sca (talk) 12:42, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support in principle per JMonkey. Fakescientist8000 (talk) 13:54, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support. The Kessler syndrome may have been triggered: "The Kessler syndrome is troublesome because of the domino effect and feedback runaway wherein impacts between objects of sizable mass spall off debris from the force of the collision. The fragments can then hit other objects, producing even more space debris: if a large enough collision or explosion were to occur, such as between a space station and a defunct satellite, or as the result of hostile actions in space, then the resulting debris cascade could make prospects for long-term viability of satellites in particular low Earth orbits extremely low." Count Iblis (talk) 14:52, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support - Russia is weaponizing space. Whether or not they were the first to do it - and presumably they weren't - this is an indication of a change in global affairs when it comes to outer space.--WaltCip-(talk) 16:16, 17 November 2021 (UTC) If you didn't know (see anti-satellite weapon), the first ASAT test was in 1959, and was conducted by the US. Banedon (talk) 02:06, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Comment any admins around here to post this?

The election comission has announced that We Continue the Change has won most seats, so therefore such a nomination can now be made. As we have posted the winner in the previous elections, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:In_the_news/Candidates/July_2021#(Posted)_Bulgarian_parliamentary_election. They are a new party too, so surprising. I have added a result synopsis and started the aftermath. Good article, have spent a lot of time on it myself with a few others. BastianMAT (talk) 14:45, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Support Article has minimum of prose describing the leadup, results, and aftermath. More writing would be nice, but it's passable for the main page. Everything is referenced and it has prose, which is more than can be said for many of the nominations of this type. --Jayron32 12:01, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: Is it time to start the English wikibio for the other co-leader of We Continue the Change, Asen Vasilev? The coalition has two leaders, not just Petkov. Do we want to wait till a government is formed? --PFHLai (talk) 12:01, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I guess yeah, he deserves one too, but Petkov is the primary focus here as he is the one seeking to become prime minister (per https://www.euronews.com/2021/11/14/bulgarian-elections-newly-formed-pp-party-neck-and-neck-with-right-wing-gerb-party). The truth is we don't even know yet if they will be successful forming a goverment, but we posted both the Czech party SPOLU and the last Bulgarian election when ITN won the most seats as the election itself is ITNR, so going by that this nomination/blurb should be suitable to make it out to the front page.BastianMAT (talk) 12:17, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support Article is in great shape. I think the easiest way to solve what PFHLai exposes is to put in the blurb that Petkov is the "co-leader", thus making it understood that he is not the only one leading the coalition. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 12:42, 16 November 2021 (UTC) How about not mentioning either co-leaders in the blurb?

Half of the seats in the lower chamber and 1/3 of the upper chamber are up for election and our article defines general elections as "elections in which all or most members of a political body are chosen." Scaramouche33 (talk) 16:16, 15 November 2021 (UTC) I half-wondered if such "mid-term" elections were covered by ITNR. If they are, perhaps that should also be explicitly noted at ITNR. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 16:19, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Yeah, mid terms elections are part of it, it is notable too as the ruling party have lost their majority. Here is the US one that was also posted. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:In_the_news/Candidates/November_2018#(Posted)_2018_US_Midterm_Elections.BastianMAT (talk) 16:28, 15 November 2021 (UTC) But that was mainly because it involved "all or most members of a political body are chosen". This doesn't appear to be the case here. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 16:44, 15 November 2021 (UTC) It depends on how you see on it. The mid term senate elections in US only feature 34 members up running for election. In Argentina it was half of the congress and enough for an significant change in both political bodies (ruling party losing control of both the house and the senate).BastianMAT (talk) 16:53, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Well it doesn't matter what happened in the US, how does this meet the requirements at ITNR? The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 16:59, 15 November 2021 (UTC) From what I understand, in the US midterms all House seats+1/3 of Senate seats were up for election so that would be considered as "most members of an electoral body" but here it's only half. Does that still count as general elections? If so it's ITN/R, if not who knows. Scaramouche33 (talk) 17:14, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Yeah I agree, it is arguable for both sides. At least based on this, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midterm_election, Argentina[1] (legislative and local election) falls under the heading General elections (which makes it ITNR) alongside the United States (legislative and local election) which was posted.BastianMAT (talk) 17:17, 15 November 2021 (UTC) I'm not sure it is arguable here, it doesn't meet the definition in ITNR and it's a mid-term, not a general election by any normal definition (despite what "Wikipedia" might say). The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 17:30, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – First four grafs back into the results and seem needlessly complex. – Sca (talk) 17:19, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Comment the table in the infobox violates MOS:COLHEAD by having column headers in the middle of the table.

Credits: Nominated by AFreshStart (talk · give credit) Created by Serial Number 54129 (talk · give credit) Nominator's comments: This is a current event and newsworthy. —AFreshStart (talk) 16:33, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support this has been declared a terrorist incident, and is generating lots of news (it's prominent on the BBC News site still). I believe it's the first bombing in England since 2017 Manchester Arena one, and caused the UK terror threat level to be increased. Article itself is good enough quality. Joseph2302 (talk) 17:23, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support given that they have assigned terrorist motives to this now. My attempt at a more concise/ITN-style altblurb given, please edit as needed. --Masem (t) 17:34, 16 November 2021 (UTC) "Police said the motivation for the attack was unclear but it had been declared as a terrorist incident." InedibleHulk (talk) 21:48, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support Article is of sufficient length and quality, properly referenced, and item is in the news currently. No objections here. --Jayron32 17:35, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Comment Has also been nominated at DYK.-- Pawnkingthree (talk) 18:00, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support alt still in the news. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 18:04, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose This was a minor terrorist attack that caused only one casualty. Now we are not concerned about the number of victims? Certainly "is in the news", but I don't think it has the same relevance as other terrorist incidents that have occurred that have not been approved to be on Main Page. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 18:33, 16 November 2021 (UTC) The perpetrator was killed and the taxi driver was hospitalised. Martinevans123 (talk) 18:40, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. Failed attack which caused one injury and killed the attacker. It's not clear what the target was or who it was supposed to terrorise. If this hadn't been declared a terrorist incident it would be minor local news. I encourage the existing DYK nom instead. Modest Genius talk 19:02, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Regardless of terrorism tag, I suspect this would have been national news. But of course, we will never know. The fact is it is big national news. Martinevans123 (talk) 19:07, 16 November 2021 (UTC) But it was declared a terrorist attack, which adds notability to the incident. Jbvann05 20:32, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Not really, it just grants the police additional powers and generates more headlines. The actual event doesn't become any worse. Modest Genius talk 13:18, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Support alt Notable, now declared a terrorist incident, article in decent shape.  Spy-cicle?  Talk? 19:15, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support - Terrorism need not have a high death count in order to be notable and newsworthy; we have posted terrorist incidents on ITN that have had a death toll of zero.--WaltCip-(talk) 20:04, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Comment I find it very interesting how many of those who support this nomination refused to publish the terrorist attack in Auckland in September, whose consequences were almost the same as in this case. Any clarification? _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 20:58, 16 November 2021 (UTC) What do you mean "refused to publish"? They didn't !vote there. Apart from Modest Genius, who is opposed here also? Martinevans123 (talk) 21:05, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you for your answer because clearly I've realized that I have not expressed myself well. I mean that at the time, the reason why I've opposed was the same used by other users (who have not participated in this debate, except Modest Genius) to not support the cited nomination in September. That is why I am frankly surprised. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 21:29, 16 November 2021 (UTC) BLP Caution One suspect is dead, but four others are arrested in connection; might want to attribute this "attempted terrorist bombing" instead of stating it as a fact Wikipedia knows (a "declaration" from police is still an allegation). InedibleHulk (talk) 21:37, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Counter Terrorism Police Caution: all four have been released: [9]. Martinevans123 (talk) 21:50, 16 November 2021 (UTC) OK, nevermind then. Can't go wrong speaking ill of the dead. At least by Wikipedian norms. InedibleHulk (talk) 22:10, 16 November 2021 (UTC) No need to get personal, if you don't mind. Norman Butkiss 123 (talk) 22:47, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. I will admit to perhaps being more jaded to bomb stories than some other nationalities may be, but even with that notwithstanding, I don't believe we'd be considering an attack which killed no victims and injured one if it took place elsewhere (we recently didn't post, for example, an attack that targeted but didn't kill a head of state). That isn't necessarily to say there's any deliberate bias here but it's important to remember that England has a well-developed media sphere and any regional story will have a lot of domestic coverage, but we are not necessarily beholden to repeat their biases. For reference, even the BBC have displaced this story in favour of the latest update in a racism dispute in county cricket. ??????? ? 21:46, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support major incident, leading news story, article decent. Polyamorph (talk) 21:48, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support (Alt 2). UK terror threat level raised from substantial to severe pushes it over the edge. Martinevans123 (talk) 23:15, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose As suicide in Britain goes, it was unusually public and explosive, but lacks too much death and destruction next to the general public suicide bombings (a similar story from Strathroy-Caradoc#History isn't even an article, for context). InedibleHulk (talk) 23:19, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose -- it's already stopped being news, it seems. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 02:50, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Questionable significance since nothing major [fortunately] did not take place. Gotitbro (talk) 07:12, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose as the investigation has not been completed and it has not been confirmed yet whether it was terrorism, whether the detonation was intentional or accidental, or who the intended victim or victims might to have been. The current article contains too much opinion, innuendo, and speculation portrayed as fact. -- DeFacto (talk). 07:38, 17 November 2021 (UTC) By all means mark any "opinion, innuendo, and speculation portrayed as fact" and/or take to the talk page. Opinion is generally permitted if it's clearly attributed? Thanks. Martinevans123 (talk) 11:21, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Very Strong Oppose Per WP:Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, we are supposed to be an encyclopedia, and we are NOT supposed to be a dangerous free publicity machine for every murderous suicidal nutter, still less for every would-be terrorist and every terrorist organisation. So a terrorist incident should be truly exceptional and notable before appearing on our front page, all the more so as it is often liable to remain there giving dangerous free publicity (and thus in practice encouragement) to terrorists and other murderous nutters long after it has disappeared from the front pages of other mainstream Western news outlets (as many terrorists probably already realize, even if many editors around here seemingly don't). There is NOTHING in this incident that gives it the required exceptionality and notability to justify the danger this poses to innocent people, as well as the damage it might (rightly in my view) do to our reputation. Tlhslobus (talk) 18:15, 17 November 2021 (UTC) See WP:RIGHTGREATWRONGS. Your diatribe is interesting, but nothing to do with ITNC, otherwise we'd never publish another mass shooting in the US ever again. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 18:27, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose No lasting effect plus terrible disjointed article means it's a No from me, Bob. Black Kite (talk) 18:23, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose The story stopped trending yesterday, and the death/injury toll is very low (luckily). If attacks of this kind were rare in the UK I would be willing to overlook these factors, but (unfortunately) there's been a seemingly-steady uptick in the last couple of years, so there's nothing about this that makes it stand out. Mount Patagonia (talk) 18:27, 17 November 2021 (UTC) But the satellite blow-up stopped trending 36 hours ago and no-one died. Terror attacks where bombs are ignited on Remembrance Day are few and far between, I'm sure you can point me to the last time that happened, right? The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 18:29, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I was referencing upticks in UK-based terror attacks in general, not ones falling on Rememberance Day. If terror attacks that fell on special occasions were automatic shoe-ins, then last year's Christmas bombing in Nashville would have been posted, but it wasn't for the same reasons I'm opposing posting this story. For the Russian satellite, take it up with the people for voted for it because I had no involvement in that decision. Mount Patagonia (talk) 22:06, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Indeed, terror attacks often happen on supposedly significant days or dates (sometimes perhaps coincidentally, sometimes perhaps as part of an attempt to increase the attack's psychological impact, or perhaps sometimes for quasi-religious reasons). Not only do we not use this as an excuse to put it into ITN, we sometimes leave it out of the article as well. For instance it was 5 years before Wikipedia mentioned that the Bataclan attacks occurred on Friday the 13th and there is still no link from it to the article about the superstition, presumably because RS don't mention such a link (perhaps to avoid making vulnerable people more fearful or otherwise psychologically distressed or harmed whenever 'significant' dates approach). Tlhslobus (talk) 15:33, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Comment we don't need to name the perp in any of the blurbs. That's totally undue. Get a grip people. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 18:30, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I've been bold and removed the name of the perp. We don't need that, even if this isn't posted, anywhere near this encyclopedia. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 20:17, 17 November 2021 (UTC) The name of the perpetrator is encyclopedic and should be in the article; but I agree that it should not be posted in ITN regardless. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 00:14, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose No victims and unclear / unorganised motive. Belugsump (talk) 03:44, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – Limited significance. No longer in the news. – Sca (talk) 13:06, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose.

T20 World Cup[edit] Article: 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup Final (talk · history · tag) Blurb: ?In cricket, the T20 World Cup concludes with Australia defeating New Zealand in the final (Post) News source(s): BBC Guardian Credits: Nominated by Modest Genius (talk · give credit) Updated by Chandraach (talk · give credit) Article updated The nominated event is listed on WP:ITN/R, so each occurrence is presumed to be important enough to post. Comments should focus on whether the quality of the article and update meet WP:ITNCRIT, not the significance. Nominator's comments: I'm not keen on T20, but this is ITNR. Prose summaries of both innings are present though are currently unreferenced. It doesn't seem at all controversial though, so should be easy to source from a few match reports (such as those linked above). Modest Genius talk 12:33, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Comment the table in "Road to the final" section is ugly- couldn't this just be done in a paragraph of text, as in 2016 article? Joseph2302 (talk) 14:36, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Agree. It's also not compliant with MOS:ACCESS since it contains nested tables. This should be fixed before it's posted on the main page.  — Amakuru (talk) 17:17, 15 November 2021 (UTC) MOS:DTAB is a laudable goal, but not one of the WP:ITNCRIT. It's probably moot though, as no improvements to the article have been made in the last 3 days. Modest Genius talk 11:36, 17 November 2021 (UTC) While articles on topics such as sporting events and economics lend themselves to tables of numbers, updates must be at least in part written in prose to qualify for ITN consideration. That isn't the case here, as the section in question is using ugly nested tables rather than prose (like I suggested doing days ago).

Please read the guidelines. Admin instructions are here. ??Skip to suggestions In the news toolbox Error reports Nominations (Archives) Discussion General criteria Death criteria Recurring items Admin guide Image protection Current events portal v t e Shortcut WP:ITN/C This page provides a forum for editors to suggest items for inclusion on In the news (ITN), a protected template on the Main Page, as well as the forum for discussion of candidates. This is not the page to report errors in the ITN section on the Main Page—please go to the appropriate section at WP:ERRORS. Archives of past nominations can be found here. This candidates page is integrated with the daily pages of Portal:Current events. Under each daily section header below is the transcluded Portal:Current events items for that day (with a light green header). Each day's portal page is followed by a subsection for suggestions and discussion. A blurb is a one sentence summary of the news story. An alternate suggestion for the blurb is called an altblurb, and any more suggestions get labelled alt1, alt2, etc. A blurb needs at least one target article, highlighted in bold; reviewers check the quality of that article and whether it is updated, and whether reliable sources demonstrate the significance of the event. Other articles can also be linked. The Ongoing line is for regularly updated articles which cover events that remain in the news over a longer period of time. RD stands for the "recent deaths" line, and can include any living thing whose death was recently announced. In some cases, recent deaths may need additional explanation as provided by a blurb; this is decided by consensus.

Sterling Cary Edgardo Labella Other recent events Nominate an article view — page history — related changes — edit How to nominate an item[edit] In order to suggest a candidate: Update an article to be linked to from the blurb to include the recent developments, or find an article that has already been updated. Find the correct section below for the date of the event (not the date nominated). Do not add sections for new dates. These are automatically generated (at midnight UTC) by a bot; creating them manually breaks this process. Nominate the blurb for ITN inclusion under the "Suggestions" subheading for the date, emboldening the link in the blurb to the updated article. Use a level 4 header (====) when doing so. Preferably use the template {{ITN candidate}} to nominate the article related to the event in the news. Make sure that you include a reference from a verifiable, reliable secondary source. Press releases are not acceptable. The suggested blurb should be written in simple present tense. Adding an explanation why the event should be posted greatly increases the odds of posting. Please consider alerting editors to the nomination by adding the template {{ITN note}} to the corresponding article's talk page. Purge this page to update the cache There are criteria which guide the decision on whether or not to put a particular item on In the news, based largely on the extensiveness of the updated content and the perceived significance of the recent developments. These are listed at WP:ITN. Submissions that do not follow the guidelines at Wikipedia:In the news will not be placed onto the live template. Headers[edit] Items that have been posted or pulled from the main page are generally marked with (Posted) or (Pulled) in the item's subject so it is clear they are no longer active. Items can also be marked as (Ready) when the article is both updated and there seems to be a consensus to post. The posting admin, however, should always judge the update and the consensus to post themselves. If you find an entry that you don't feel is ready to post is marked (Ready), you should remove the mark in the header. Voicing an opinion on an item[edit] Format your comment to contain "support" or "oppose", and include a rationale for your choice. In particular, address the notability of the event, the quality of the article, and whether it has been updated. Please do not...[edit] add simple "support!" or "oppose!" votes without including your reasons. Similarly, curt replies such as "who?", "meh", or "duh!" are usually not helpful. Instead, explain the reasons why you think the item meets or does not meet the ITN inclusion criteria so a consensus can be reached. oppose an item because the event is only relating to a single country, or failing to relate to one. This applies to a high percentage of the content we post and is unproductive. accuse other editors of supporting, opposing or nominating due to a personal bias (such as ethnocentrism).

The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 10:35, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Over a million people die on the roads every year – that's over 3,000 every day. The coverage of this case says that "there were often accidents in the area". It's routine.

Joseph2302 (talk) 08:35, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Not terrorism, according to "sources", so whilst tragic, it appears to be a worse-than-usual crime gone wrong. Black Kite (talk) 08:44, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support -- It seems that around five people died in the attack. The perpetrator has been reported by a few media outlets as Daniel Brooks, a black man who raps under the name "MathboiFly" and has tons of social media posts supporting BLM, and this was in the aftermath of a very notable event where Rittenhouse was cleared as killing two black men in self-defence. OldPeace7068 (talk) 09:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Complete extrapolation. Police have said they believe he was on the run having committed a separate crime, nothing to do with Rittenhouse at all. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 09:35, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Wikipedia is there to report the facts. Police and many members of the public initially considered the possibility of Islamic terrorism due to similar incidents in the past involving Muslims, the targeting of a western festival, and the recent rise in Islamic terrorist activity, but police have now confirmed that this is not terrorism related. Similarly, there have been widespread links/controversy made between the rapper and his connections to BLM, and it has been linked to Rittenhouse whether you like it or not. It is part of the story. The killer is a major supporter and activist of BLM. And this happened in the aftermath of Rittenhouse's acquittal. It's all part of the background and developing story. OldPeace7068 (talk) 09:45, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Not at all. The police have stated he was fleeing a separate scene. Conflating this with BLM/Rittenhouse is pure crystal balling. Thanks. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 09:47, 22 November 2021 (UTC) "two black men" and you'd think we were on a website about facts... CharredWaffle (talk) 14:04, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. Calling this an "attack" may be a misnomer as it appears that the suspect was fleeing the police, not that it was a preplanned attack or terrorism. 331dot (talk) 12:50, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Maybe so. OTOH, at least one report quotes a witness as saying the vehicle seemed to be "targeting people" as it veered from side to side. Also, reports say it crashed through barriers to reach the parade, which seems to indicate that it was indeed an attack, though possibly not a pre-planned one. – Sca (talk) 16:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment The blurb should (and currently does not) mention the country in which this event took place. Chrisclear (talk) 12:56, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose - It's not at all clear that this is an act of terrorism, and thus not something that would be imminently notable.--WaltCip-(talk) 13:09, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose both on merit and article quality. As of this comment, the incident does not appear to have been a deliberate attack. I would be open to reconsideration if contrary information comes to light. Also, at present the article is little more than an oversized stub. It's not ready for the main page. -Ad Orientem (talk) 13:13, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support ... pending expansion of article, which presently comprises a mere 250 words, i.e. a stub. Seems to be the No. 1 story on main RS sites today. Note 40+ injuries. (Please spare me the de rigueur "U.S.-centric" harangue. This event is unusual and widely covered.) – Sca (talk) 14:34, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Not sure this deserves to be on the main page and the article doesn't look very good. ArsenalGhanaPartey (talk) 15:31, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment If the incident turns out not to be terrorist motivated, I honestly don't see it in Main Page, and if it's , with five dead, I 'mnot very clear, although the number of injured is dantesque. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 15:51, 22 November 2021 (UTC) If this is confirmed as an unfortunate series of events with no purposeful motivating factor (driver escaping from knife fight and inadvertently ran through parade crowd), then I would agree this is not really something that should be posted. This doesn't mean motiveless events can't ever be posted but I would expect the results to be more devasting (like the various major building fires or collapses that we had). --Masem (t) 16:36, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Exactly, I think the same Masem. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 17:30, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Wait – As an AP update seems to suggest this was the act of a lone nutcase with a record, I've withdrawn my provisonal support. However, it seems we're still in a wait situation, since nine of the injured are listed in critical condition. If the toll were to rise to double digits, we might still want to consider a blurb about this very nasty event. – Sca (talk) 18:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support if the motivation turns out to be terrorism, neutral if otherwise. Mlb96 (talk) 19:04, 22 November 2021 (UTC) A post – by an IT user with no other contributions – on our article's talk page posits racial motivation.

The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 19:11, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Please see expanded comment above. Thanks. – Sca (talk) 19:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support. This event is in the news and the article looks to be in good shape. -- Tavix (talk) 19:38, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: – Since perp's been ID'd & police say he'll face five counts of first-degree intentional homicide, this is looking potentially more significant. – Sca (talk) 20:02, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Per The Independent this guy had a domestic dispute, and drove his car like a lunatic. Not terror-related, just an idiot behind the wheel. Not significant, tragic, but will never make the top 1000 things that happened on Planet Earth in 2021, let alone the top 250. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support - a mass-casualty event, receiving international coverage (e.g., BBC), a suspect is being charged, and the article has been improved to sufficient quality. Levivich 20:04, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support - rare (even in the US) mass-casualty event. Article quality is decent. Destroyeraa (Alternate account) 20:28, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment a road traffic accident in the US is not rare. Mass-casualty events in the US are far from rare. It's pretty obvious that giving this tragic yet non-terrorist/non-BLM/non-protest/non-deliberate accident undue prominence is not what the encyclopedia was designed to do. Of course, you can dig into the BBC website and find coverage, it's all "shock and think of the children" in the US, but the rest of the world has moved on the moment it was clear it was a sad instance of a crime somewhere else having shitty side-effects, and literally nothing more. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) The last time I remember a similar incident happened in the US was late 2017 when somebody plowed into a crowd in Virginia after a violent demonstration got broken up. We posted the event that it was tangentially related to, largely on the strength of somebody plowing their car into a crowd and killing someone. You supported posting it. Rockphed (talk) 01:03, 23 November 2021 (UTC) If you're referring to Charlottesville car attack, that was about a man deliberately setting out to ram people. This is about a man trying to escape the scene of a domestic incident and getting into a road traffic accident. The two are incomparable. But good try. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 08:07, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Agreeing with previous posters, posting this event would seem to be giving undue weight to a tragic traffic accident. Comparison with the Charlottesville incident from several years back is unfair, given the explicitly political motivations of the earlier event. Wizardoftheyear (talk) 01:17, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Neutral and Wait Yes, with the additional details that have come to light, this is literally a domestic issue that had decidedly more tragic consequences. However, that is additional details. The initial response, and the fact there were several fatalities during a celebration, caught on camera and shared around the world before anyone knew what was going on, has made this major news and a source of intrigue. I think we need to wait to see if the news stations drop their coverage now that there is less intrigue and crisis; if it has effectively left the news cycle by end of day, take this as an oppose, but if it is still on the news banners, take this as support. Kingsif (talk) 01:42, 23 November 2021 (UTC) 4 of the 12 paragraphs in this article start "On November 2X". Typical anti-American bias from the Brits (which is far from rare) notwithstanding, the quality is not there yet. GreatCaesarsGhost 02:23, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Support - Tragic, criminally-induced mass-casualty. Significant details are now known. CoatCheck (talk) 03:03, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Wait It's very clear that there won't be consensus as is, but there may be more of one as things develop. Wait for now. DarkSide830 (talk) 03:46, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Strong Support. This is the deadliest vehicle ramming incident in the United States or Canada since 2018 and the deadliest in the US since 2017. 142.182.136.105 (talk) 07:37, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Comment I see there's been a tragic bus crash in Bulgaria which has killed at least 45 people. It would be safe to presume that supporters of this accident would support the posting of the Bulgarian crash, right? The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 08:09, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Nominate an article on it so that I can assess the quality. Without knowing what we are posting on the main page, it is impossible for me to know if the article is appropriate. --Jayron32 12:56, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Four hours ago....

Leaning toward support, for all the diff that would make here. – Sca (talk) 13:49, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Support for multiple fatalities, high number of serious injuries, and widespread news coverage. Jehochman Talk 13:50, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose A tragic event, but it is not a mass-casualty event. ArsenalGhanaPartey (talk) 14:11, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Comment - We have support and oppose !votes that directly contradict each other in terms of the notability of this event.

How is an admin supposed to derive consensus from this? --WaltCip-(talk) 15:05, 23 November 2021 (UTC) By executive fiat. – Sca (talk) 15:44, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Well most of the support votes are from Americans (of those who have userpages), and almost all of the opposes are from non-Americans.

This at first got attention because it might have been terrorism related, no problem there. But all we are left with now is an accident which leaves 5 death: while tragic, this is sadly an everyday occurrence. We have e.g. this week a ferry accident in Sri Lanka (at least 6 death)[2], 7 death in Greece when migrants flee the police[3], 22 deaths on Lake Kivu[4], nine deaths in a fire in Bulgaria[5], 10 deaths in China after a car crash[6], ... I see no reason to post this, as it is not exceptional, has no lasting importance, and isn't even very interesting (without the terrorism angle). It's a sad tragedy, but a very common one. Fram (talk) 17:03, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. Per Fram, tragic, but not significant enough at a global scale: we don't even have articles about many similar tragedies elsewhere.

Major election in an EU member state. – Illegitimate Barrister (talk • contribs), 02:46, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Question Do we post presidential elections even if the president has mostly symbolic roles? Scaramouche33 (talk) 07:32, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, heads of state elections are posted even if they are ceremonial/wield little power, it mostly depends on the article quality itself which should be more than sufficient. Two examples are the Italian presidental election and Czech presidental election, both having similar powers to the Bulgarian one. [7] [8] BastianMAT (talk) 09:02, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Weak support this article has been on front page for a week already, but I guess the second round presidency vote means that it's ITN eligible again. Article looks to have been sufficiently updated about the presidential second round vote. Joseph2302 (talk) 12:10, 22 November 2021 (UTC) This is not ITNR. We no longer post all elections for head of state- we post the election/choosing of the official with actual executive power, according to List of current heads of state and government; in Bulgaria that is the PM, not the president. 331dot (talk) 12:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) In which case, I oppose this nomination, and it shouldn't have been tagged as ITNR. Joseph2302 (talk) 12:37, 22 November 2021 (UTC) In fairness, it is a recent change that not everyone may be aware of. 331dot (talk) 12:41, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Alright, I thought going by older posts that head of state elections are still part of ITNR but if its been removed, no problem and thanks for the headsup for future nominations. BastianMAT (talk) 12:46, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I just saw this now. I must have missed the change or forgot about it. So my comment on other presidents is not relevant here. --Tone 17:49, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Exactly, that’s what got me confused to when I ITNR nominated this. In the past as you and I mentioned, similar head of state elections (with similar powers) such as Moldova(November 2020), Germany, Austria, Italy, Czech Republic have been posted. 331dot said the removal of ceremonial head of state elections from ITNR were ’recently’ done, so the change must have not been too long ago for us to not know that.BastianMAT (talk) 18:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Blurb on MainPage was updated and moved up --PFHLai (talk) 13:11, 22 November 2021 (UTC) PFHLai there wasn't consensus to do this update- the presidential election is not ITNR, and there was not consensus here that it's important enough for ITN. We should leave it where it is, so it can roll off soon, instead of moving it up so it'll stay on ITN for another week... Joseph2302 (talk) 13:27, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Post posting support If the election was stand-alone, we would probably post it. This is just the case where the general election were held together with the first round of presidential, so there is a single article. I don't see a problem. --Tone 14:56, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I doubt we would post this as a standalone item. He may be head of state, but he has no power. It's the Prime Minister of Bulgaria who would be posted automatically.  — Amakuru (talk) 17:18, 22 November 2021 (UTC) In fact he has been in de facto power since the 2021 April elections as he appointed his friend as acting prime minister. The de jure power he wields is similar to those in Italy and Czech Republic, where he gets to nominate the prime minister and supreme court judges, he can veto laws (although parliament can override) and he of course serves as head of state, don’t forget Bulgaria even has a vice president. In the past we have posted the Italian presidental and Czech Republic presidental elections, both are parliamantary republics too. I thought it was ITNR, but 331dot mentioned that head of state elections (where the head of state is not head of goverment) was recently removed from ITNR. Italian presidental election posted Czech Republic presidental election posted BastianMAT (talk) 17:32, 22 November 2021 (UTC) (ec) As far as I remember we post both if the articles are ok. We've posted presidents of Austria and Germany, which have a similar role, for example. Furthermore, the president of Germany is elected by Bundestag, not by a popular vote. --Tone 17:36, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Pull update and Revert back to previous version per Joseph2302. This guy is just a figure head, and we already posted the main election result. There was no reason to have bumped this up, and the result is not ITN/R so needs consensus, which it doesn't have.  — Amakuru (talk) 17:14, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Pull update and agree with above, not seeing consensus here for this to have even been posted in the first instance. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 17:21, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Beyond the issue of whether it should be on the main page, the blurb is clumsy. "In Bulgaria," is redundant. Where else but in Bulgaria would you be elected President of Bulgaria? Schwede66 17:57, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Restored old blurb. --PFHLai (talk) 18:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose pull Not a head of state change but in the same spirit This post was made by orbitalbuzzsaw gang (talk) 19:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment I think we need some kind of page break to restart voting. A lot of the opposition above was to the unilateral action and not the nom itself. as for me, Oppose while there are some states with significant power invested in the secondary office, this is not one of them. GreatCaesarsGhost 21:55, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I didn't particularly mind about the unilateral action myself - it was made in good faith - and my oppose is purely on the merits of the case, for much the same reasons as you.

The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 23:23, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Not that it matters to this nomination, but Rittenhouse's victims were white. GreatCaesarsGhost 00:04, 20 November 2021 (UTC) *cough cough* Rittenhouse's victims were white *cough cough* – John M Wolfson (talk • contribs) 00:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Who said he wasn't talking about Young Dolph's routine assassin? We don't know he wasn't white. We don't know if he had other black American victims. Memphis is all about unsolved mysteries! AGF. InedibleHulk (talk) 02:06, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose on quality The article needs a lot of work, as there are multiple sections with no inline citations.Pawnkingthree (talk) 23:42, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support While this might be unduly implicative of the Chinese state being connected, if RSs are making that connection this definitely belongs. – John M Wolfson (talk • contribs) 00:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose on quality I would support this if the article has some ref work done. There's sections that are unsourced. --TDKR Chicago 101 (talk) 00:34, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose this is newsworthy for sure but blurbing that someone "disappeared" after making an accusation seems like a WP:BLPCRIME issue to me. --LaserLegs (talk) 00:39, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Completely agree it's an awkward thing to summarise in a way that fits BLP while keeping it clear why the event is notable, I'd welcome suggestions for alternative phrasing. I realise this is a fairly limited action, but for that reason I deliberately didn't link to the person she accused in the proposed blurb. Blythwood (talk) 01:57, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose as per LaserLegs, there's something wrong about posting speculation that someone disappeared straight after they made accusations. With little reliable information, this seems like a BLP issue to post it. Joseph2302 (talk) 01:47, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Far too speculative, with overtones of anti-China sentiment, and with too many unknowns. Needs far more clarification before it is posted. And a guarantee that ITN will publish a full We Were Wrong! statement and retraction on the Main page when it is found out she has just eloped with her boyfriend or girlfriend, as the case may be. HiLo48 (talk) 01:55, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Clearly if China "disappeared" her, that would be a story, but this appears to be Western nations making a demand of China and there's no hard evidence she has been killed or imprisoned or the like. We don't post this type of speculative stories. --Masem (t) 02:16, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support Per wide coverage in RSes. Normchou?? 03:22, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose unless the incident has a separate article. Sun8908?Talk 07:38, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support — article looks decent enough for ITN standards by my eye, wide coverage in RSes. If the choice of "disappears" is undesirable, then "is reported missing" might be a potential alternative (posted as altblurb). [osunpokeh/talk/contributions] 08:41, 20 November 2021 (UTC) I think that suggests she was reported missing in the police report sense, not that Novak Djokovic described her as "a missing person" to reporters. Not a bad idea. Just a bit ambiguous. InedibleHulk (talk) 09:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Strong support, in the news, top page news in many countries. The issue is she has suddenly disappeared after accusing a senior cabinet minister of a serious crime, and the involved parties are public figures indept of this incident, so there is nothing wrong as long as it is sourced and not stated as truth. Peng's disappearance and the resulting sports diplomacy pressure and boycott threats are sufficient Bumbubookworm (talk) 12:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Have you ever studied the difference between correlation and causation? HiLo48 (talk) 21:48, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Yes I have and I wonder if it's possible to have a maths competition over Wikipedia lol. I never said there was a causation, although I am sure many on Wikipedia have noted your hard-left POV eg trying to get all right of centre Australian newspapers struck off at RSN. Bumbubookworm (talk) 22:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Applause.

Polyamorph (talk) 20:03, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support per above. The article has unref'd sections about her tennis career, but the linked section is ready. Davey2116 (talk) 21:52, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. We shouldn't (and don't) post articles with multiple unsourced sections. The fact that the section linked in bold is referenced is irrelevant. Black Kite (talk) 23:26, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Wait Let's wait until we are 100% sure what has happened to her. Heythereimaguy (talk) 23:53, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Global Times continues to point to her, this time at a restaurant with a coach and friends, seemingly quite visible. Western speculation now turns to whether she's safe, though, or free from external interference or to be believed. All very personal and hard-to-answer questions, for anybody anywhere. InedibleHulk (talk) 00:10, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose it's just one person in a world where much worse things happen in other places like Ethiopia. Banedon (talk) 01:11, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose for now. Videos of Peng Shuai have supposedly surfaced. Nice4What (talk · contribs) – (Thanks ?) 03:30, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Support However, I propose removing the term 'Chinese' in front of Peng Shuai. It does not add to her character or her identity as a professional tennis player. Something along the lines of "Professional tennis player Peng Shuai disappears after accusing former Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli of sexual assault." would be better imo. However, we should also note the videos posted by Global Times editors (primarily those tweeted by editor-in-chief Hu Xijin) and their aftermath. JMonkey2006 (talk) 11:10, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – She's reappeared, online at least. End of story? – Sca (talk) 13:34, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Strong support Wide coverage by RSes and notable. Fakescientist8000 (talk) 14:05, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Still too murky and speculative, with little general impact. – Sca (talk) 15:24, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Leaving aside anything else, there is video evidence of her out and about so she hasn't been "disappeared" and isn't "missing". Whether or not something else is happening is in the realm of speculation, and would require a separate blurb. Also, very large swathes of the article on her career lack even a single citation.

This applies to a high percentage of the content we post and is unproductive." "International notability" is not a criteria for posting at ITN, nor has it ever been. --Jayron32 19:05, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Well my direct opinion is that it is not notable. My reasoning is the discussion that already took place on the 2021 talk page. I also have previous discussions months ago where things highly notable to one country aren’t included. Elijahandskip (talk) 19:11, 19 November 2021 (UTC) This is not a discussion of the page 2021. The criteria established for other parts of Wikipedia don't apply here. If you wish to change the criteria used for the ITN box, then start a discussion at WT:ITN. Votes without valid rationales are given little weight. It's fine if you have a useful rationale, but merely "I don't think it's notable enough" does not provide any useful guidance to admins when deciding consensus. I mean, you're allowed to say any silly thing you want, I suppose, but you can't expect anyone to take you seriously if it isn't valid. --Jayron32 19:18, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Well since you don’t like my reasoning, just let me say “no”. People have supported ITN’s in the past without giving a reason, so my “Oppose” in this case will not have a reason. Elijahandskip (talk) 19:22, 19 November 2021 (UTC) As I said, it's a free world. People do nonsensical things all of the time. --Jayron32 19:24, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Yep, I couldn’t agree more. In reality, my oppose on this comes more to combat American Wikipedia vs English Wikipedia. There is a essay on Wikipedia that I recently read that has that meaning. Not everything that happens in America is notable for Wikipedia/2021/ITN/Portal Current Events, etc….Elijahandskip (talk) 19:34, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose (at least on news of just the verdict). It was a highly watched case in the U.S., but it was clear early on to many legal experts that are crying foul on judicial behavior. It is very very likely to see an appeal and so this is not the end. This is not like the result from the very public George Floyd protests (which we posted and had ongoing about those, and the verdict). That said, there had been concerns there may be rioting following an acquittal , and while I'm not seeing any immediate news on that, a major riot (akin to the LA riots after King's verdict) would likely be the newsworthy factor here. --Masem (t) 19:05, 19 November 2021 (UTC) There literally cannot be any appeal of a not guilty verdict. This is a core principle of how double jeopardy is handled in American jurisprudence. A not guilty jury verdict is basically always final. See [9]. There are some exceedingly rare exceptions to this, but none of them would apply in this case. An ordinary jury verdict of "not guilty" like this one (even in a controversial trial) is treated as basically sacrosanct, and there can be no appeals by the government. --Jayron32 19:08, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Except for the calls for a mistrial that are being entered now. I know there's complexities with double jeopardy there, but that's still on the books and that itself can be a legal process. --Masem (t) 19:15, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Um, what? There were calls for a mistrial by Rittenhouse's defense team prior to the jury verdict coming back. Now that the verdict is in their client's favor, I doubt highly they will press forward with these requests. Indeed, articles such as this one note "The verdict also meant that Judge Bruce Schroeder did not have to rule on the defense's motions for a mistrial." --Jayron32 19:23, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose as above. If we had to have an American court psychodrama today, the better option from a world-historical perspective would probably be the acquittal of the purported killers of Malcolm X. —Brigade Piron (talk) 19:20, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose AGF, but this is such a small story in the grand scheme. GreatCaesarsGhost 19:23, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Wait. It is too early to tell what impact this will have. It could be a Rodney King-like result where acquittal of the accused leads to broad social unrest, or it could pass with a shrug. I expect that we will know within 24 hours.

I wonder if we should put this blurb up now, or when Parliament repeals them and the farmers go home (don't have strong opinions either way, but I lean towards waiting). If we're going to put it up now, I've uploaded this screengrab of Modi's announcement from his CC-BY YouTube channel; we could use it. Btw Indefensible - Dracophyllum was the only updater, not DiplomatTesterMan. Kind regards, W. Tell DCCXLVI (talk to me!/c) 07:05, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Using the update to put back in ongoing instead of a final blurb would be fine too if preferable. And DiplomatTesterMan did more updates on the article before that, he still deserves some credit too I think. - Indefensible (talk) 07:12, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose because the article is not sufficiently updated. There is currently a 1 sentence mention in the lead of the repeal of the laws, and no mention of it, nor of any follow-on protests, anywhere in the body of the article. Before this can be posted, the latest developments would need to be added to the article appropriately. --Jayron32 12:18, 19 November 2021 (UTC) @Jayron32 Have you read the repeal section? Dracophyllum 20:10, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Your response is 8 hours after Jayron32's, Dracophyllum. The section may have not existed when Jayron commented.

Tube·of·Light 02:30, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: The announcement by itself has no legal value. Parliament has to repeal the laws, which it will probably do in the coming Winter Session. Also some farmer's unions are continuing protests until the laws are repealed and minimum support prices reconsidered. So it might be better to wait, but no strong opinion either way. --Jose Mathew (talk) 12:24, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Wait and see what the impact of this is.

In fact, we do post many India-centric stories here, this one having festered in ongoing for nearly a year. --LaserLegs (talk) 23:36, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support. Invariably it is announcements that get more attention than the actual act, most of the time(we post elections when the result is known, not when the results are official/certified). If Modi renegs, that will likely be newsworthy itself. 331dot (talk) 23:16, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Weak oppose - as Wilhelm Tell DCCXLVI says, the BKU is still protesting. I would prefer waiting till the laws are actually repealed (and FWIW, these laws are being repealed just before the 2022 Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly elections and elections in some other states, which are crucial for Modi's political party). Tube·of·Light 02:30, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – On article quality – and as others have noted because the laws haven't taken effect.

And of course, there will be no "permanent cancellation of The Boat Race", that's total bollocks, but perhaps inline with your regular contributions. As you perhaps should know already, The Boat Race 2022 is scheduled for next year, and if COVID stymies it, one imagines it will simply be moved to the River Great Ouse once again. I'm unclear as to where you think that a lunar eclipse would be a portent for the permanent cancellation of an event which has been conducted since 1829, even before the Third Reich failed to play nicely. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 17:56, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Ease up, Ramblo, it was a joke. (And BTW, the Third Reich and this topic are entirely unrelated.) – Sca (talk) 18:26, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Yeah, and this topic and the Boat Race are completely unrelated. And it wasn't funny in any sense. So explain yourself. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 18:45, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support, this lunar eclipse has gotten significant news coverage.

Power outage and a small death toll won't cut it. --PFHLai (talk) 22:35, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Comment - this is quite a significant event in Canada, with reports that it could become the most expensive natural disaster in Canadian history [13], the death toll is expected to rise, along with wide ranging effects on supply chains and transportation networks. If I recall correctly, I think we did post the 2013 Alberta floods, for precedent. Connormah (talk) 22:39, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I guess "could be" is key here. If it does become the most expensive natural disaster after electing Trudeau in the history of Canada, then it's well placed for a blurb. Maybe now is premature. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:42, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Wait Living through this, it's a pretty devastating disaster, with all road access cut off to and from the Port of Vancouver, which is having a major impact on supply chains across Western Canada. But I don't think this meets the standard previously set for ITN just yet, although there are reports that the death toll is expected to rise. There's also reports of an imminent dike breach into a large city. As such, I'd suggest that we wait.

And the Kessler syndrome advances another notch. What we're mainly missing is a good picture but we might use something generic like this. Andrew?(talk) 12:56, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support in principle, as this is a significant event for the space industry (more so than Crew-3 that we already have on the template). However the article is pretty lightweight and could use some expansion. It also needs a source for the claim that Russia was responsible for the test - we can't claim something in the blurb that isn't cited in the article. I would also remove 'dangerous' from the blurb as that's quite a strong accusation. Modest Genius talk 13:05, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Article seems fine now, though as I was one of the users updating it an independent assessment would be welcome. Modest Genius talk 18:16, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support on the merits; the use of an anti-satellite weapon(even as a test) is rare and few countries possess such technology. Russia isn't denying it. 331dot (talk) 13:10, 16 November 2021 (UTC) @331dot: Yes, the use is rare and few countries possess such technology. Yet, I remember a similar test from India a couple of years ago was rejected as the technology "has been around for a while." If I recall correctly, there had been significant debate about debris back then too. 2405:201:4013:8087:A828:E291:B9B5:4B09 (talk) 18:31, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I can only comment on the nomination in front of me; I can't speak to past ones at this time. 331dot (talk) 19:15, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support in principle though article needs to include that Russia shot it down (right now, the article just says it broke up). And other cn tags in article would need fixing. Though I agree, this is way more important/notable/covered in news sources than Crew-3. Joseph2302 (talk) 13:12, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Comment I started putting this through DYK earlier today, see Template:Did you know nominations/Kosmos 1408, since I haven't enjoyed participating in previous ITN discussions. But if you want this here, then the DYK can be withdrawn. I've updated the template above, since I started the article yesterday. Thanks. Mike Peel (talk) 13:14, 16 November 2021 (UTC) One option would be to merge this into the existing Crew-3 ISS mission blurb. If Kosmos 1408 is not bolded then it can still be a DYK too. Andrew?(talk) 13:22, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I oppose merging those blurbs - these are separate events. Modest Genius talk 14:07, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I also oppose merging- they're separate events, and this one is more important, so shouldn't be stuck on the end of some less important and newswirthy article that's only on the front page because it was alledgedly ITNR (even though that ITNR criteria was demonstrated to be unfit for purpose). And if this does reach front page, then DYK would no longer be eligible, but until that point, don't see a need to withdraw the DYK nom. Joseph2302 (talk) 14:30, 16 November 2021 (UTC) We could remove the Crew-3 blurb and replace it with this one when this is ready to go (assuming Crew-3 is still on ITN). Yeah, it doesn't get its "full time" there, but I agree that it doesn't make sense to merge, but having two ISS-related things could be seen as overwhelming the box. --Masem (t) 14:35, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – Fairly widely covered, but broader significance of a "threat" to the ISS isn't so apparent. – Sca (talk) 13:38, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Even a fleck of paint could seriously damage the ISS, one of the most expensive objects ever constructed. 331dot (talk) 11:14, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support in principle. This is very significant news and an interesting story of high encyclopedic value.--Kiril Simeonovski (talk) 13:41, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support in principle per above, just needs better fleshing out of the article. --Masem (t) 13:53, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – Upon reflection, it seems to be a serious threat all right, but ... can we post something that hasn't had a tangible effect ... yet? – Sca (talk) 14:11, 16 November 2021 (UTC) PS: My question is, did Putin authorize this stupid 'test' – or was it just an act of heedless military apparatchiks down in the bureaucracy? (Russia is an oligarchy that has a country – a country that has an enormous military.) – Sca (talk) 14:19, 16 November 2021 (UTC) The way I'm reading it, the story is more that Russia has appeared to have violated a treaty related to space-bound weapons, in addition to this being a story of interest to space exploration (the potential of damage to the ISS that forced the crew to shelter for at least two orbits as it passed through the debris field). --Masem (t) 14:17, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Reasonable enough. However, the threat to human lives (including two Russians!) seems more compelling in terms of reader interest. – Sca (talk) 14:22, 16 November 2021 (UTC) From our article on the Outer Space Treaty: "Although it forbids establishing military bases, testing weapons and conducting military maneuvers on celestial bodies, the treaty does not expressly ban all military activities in space, nor the establishment of military space forces or the placement of conventional weapons in space". Testing an anti-satellite weapon on your own target is not against any treaty, just regarded as irresponsible. Note that the US, China and India have all conducted similar tests with no legal repercussions or UN censure. Modest Genius talk 15:09, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose no longer fresh, not really in the news, rolled off a while ago and probably better suited for DYK. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 16:11, 16 November 2021 (UTC) What's your time frame for "no longer fresh"? The BBC article is only 12 hours old and the event itself occurred yesterday. It's certainly a newer event than anything currently in the ITN box... --Jayron32 16:16, 16 November 2021 (UTC) (edit conflict) The BBC published two more articles about this story in just the last hour [15] [16]. That seems pretty fresh. Modest Genius talk 16:19, 16 November 2021 (UTC) It happened yesterday, and is very much still in the news. Much more so than the posted blurbs, such as the NYC Marathon on 7 November for example. Joseph2302 (talk) 16:20, 16 November 2021 (UTC) OH sure, you can dig into websites and find more analysis, but it's not headline news and hasn't been for most of the day now. Even the article makes it clear that the "main event" has passed. Biggest headlines in the UK are now that Johnson is proposing to prevent MPs from getting paid consultancy jobs. This story is no longer even on the BBC News homepage. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 16:24, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support Article is short, but sufficient; it seems to have developed some since the earlier notes. Topic is being covered by reliable news sources. --Jayron32 16:17, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose ... for now. Article text comprises 340 words, of which 115 are background, leaving a mere 230 words about the current threat. IMO, too thin for MP promotion. Second, we shouldn't blurb something that hasn't had an impact (yet). – Sca (talk) 17:03, 16 November 2021 (UTC) PS: Given that the current situation could continue for quite some time, perhaps after a bit we should consider posting this directly to Ongoing. – Sca (talk) 17:10, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Whatever political fallout there has been is pretty much so far just a short but important burst (for blurb posting), but there's no sign this is going to escalate into something further, in comparison to the nuclear submarine sale a few months back. --Masem (t) 19:50, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Wait is there a real danger debris hits other satellites soon, or is this just "an abundance of caution"? Will there be significant geo-political ramifications from the test? Until one of those is "yes", I think we should wait. User:? (powera, ?, ?) 19:52, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Everywhere is at risk for disaster, but this info is nothing like disaster actually happening. Political story, and involving two countries who always bicker. Could change if the ISS is destroyed or something stronger than words breaks out. InedibleHulk (talk) 20:46, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Is this an RD nom for the destruction of Kosmos 1408? If so, its "career section" needs an expansion to describe how it was used while still in orbit and operational.--PFHLai (talk) 23:08, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Questionable significance as far as potential impacts, especially given at the moment it is just predictive. I would assume that the test itself is not sufficient for ITN, so I'm on the "Oppose" side here. DarkSide830 (talk) 00:01, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support even if nothing happens to the ISS, ASAT weapon tests don't happen every day, or even every year. Banedon (talk) 03:44, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support Certainly magnitudes more important than the multitude of launches posted every now and then on ITN. Gotitbro (talk) 07:09, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support significant, made the news and the article Kosmos 1408 is short but adequate. Given the military nature of this satellite and its destruction, we can't expect to know that many details. Of the proposed blurbs, only alt 1 is good. --LukeSurl t c 10:02, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support in principle this is a significant story BUT it simply cannot be posted with a blurb of this quality. Its language is misleading and makes it sound as if a functional satellite was attacked, but rather a defunct satellite was destroyed as part of a weapons test... slightly different. Possibly also include the name of the missile system, if known, and replace "Russia" with the actual agency overseeing the test. JMonkey2006 (talk) 11:10, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Feel free to propose a different blurb. Or we could simply add 'defunct' before the name of the satellite. Modest Genius talk 11:38, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – Absent from main RS sites on Wednesday; no longer in the news. Seems a minor issue without tangible effects. Neither target article is really about this event. – Sca (talk) 12:42, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support in principle per JMonkey. Fakescientist8000 (talk) 13:54, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support. The Kessler syndrome may have been triggered: "The Kessler syndrome is troublesome because of the domino effect and feedback runaway wherein impacts between objects of sizable mass spall off debris from the force of the collision. The fragments can then hit other objects, producing even more space debris: if a large enough collision or explosion were to occur, such as between a space station and a defunct satellite, or as the result of hostile actions in space, then the resulting debris cascade could make prospects for long-term viability of satellites in particular low Earth orbits extremely low." Count Iblis (talk) 14:52, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support - Russia is weaponizing space. Whether or not they were the first to do it - and presumably they weren't - this is an indication of a change in global affairs when it comes to outer space.--WaltCip-(talk) 16:16, 17 November 2021 (UTC) If you didn't know (see anti-satellite weapon), the first ASAT test was in 1959, and was conducted by the US. Banedon (talk) 02:06, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Comment any admins around here to post this? I oppose its inclusion as it's already stale in my opinion, but there's a pretty clear consensus here and the longer it's left unposted, the staler it becomes.... The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 16:21, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Posted altblurb2. --PFHLai (talk) 17:36, 17 November 2021 (UTC) The space junkies emerge triumphant. – Sca (talk) 18:23, 17 November 2021 (UTC)  ;-) References[edit] Nominators often include links to external websites and other references in discussions on this page. It is usually best to provide such links using the inline URL syntax [http://example.com] rather than using <ref></ref> tags, because that keeps all the relevant information in the same place as the nomination without having to jump to this section, and facilitates the archiving process.

Please read the guidelines. Admin instructions are here. ??Skip to suggestions In the news toolbox Error reports Nominations (Archives) Discussion General criteria Death criteria Recurring items Admin guide Image protection Current events portal v t e Shortcut WP:ITN/C This page provides a forum for editors to suggest items for inclusion on In the news (ITN), a protected template on the Main Page, as well as the forum for discussion of candidates. This is not the page to report errors in the ITN section on the Main Page—please go to the appropriate section at WP:ERRORS. Archives of past nominations can be found here. This candidates page is integrated with the daily pages of Portal:Current events. Under each daily section header below is the transcluded Portal:Current events items for that day (with a light green header). Each day's portal page is followed by a subsection for suggestions and discussion. A blurb is a one sentence summary of the news story. An alternate suggestion for the blurb is called an altblurb, and any more suggestions get labelled alt1, alt2, etc. A blurb needs at least one target article, highlighted in bold; reviewers check the quality of that article and whether it is updated, and whether reliable sources demonstrate the significance of the event. Other articles can also be linked. The Ongoing line is for regularly updated articles which cover events that remain in the news over a longer period of time. RD stands for the "recent deaths" line, and can include any living thing whose death was recently announced. In some cases, recent deaths may need additional explanation as provided by a blurb; this is decided by consensus.

Sterling Cary Edgardo Labella Other recent events Nominate an article view — page history — related changes — edit How to nominate an item[edit] In order to suggest a candidate: Update an article to be linked to from the blurb to include the recent developments, or find an article that has already been updated. Find the correct section below for the date of the event (not the date nominated). Do not add sections for new dates. These are automatically generated (at midnight UTC) by a bot; creating them manually breaks this process. Nominate the blurb for ITN inclusion under the "Suggestions" subheading for the date, emboldening the link in the blurb to the updated article. Use a level 4 header (====) when doing so. Preferably use the template {{ITN candidate}} to nominate the article related to the event in the news. Make sure that you include a reference from a verifiable, reliable secondary source. Press releases are not acceptable. The suggested blurb should be written in simple present tense. Adding an explanation why the event should be posted greatly increases the odds of posting. Please consider alerting editors to the nomination by adding the template {{ITN note}} to the corresponding article's talk page. Purge this page to update the cache There are criteria which guide the decision on whether or not to put a particular item on In the news, based largely on the extensiveness of the updated content and the perceived significance of the recent developments. These are listed at WP:ITN. Submissions that do not follow the guidelines at Wikipedia:In the news will not be placed onto the live template. Headers[edit] Items that have been posted or pulled from the main page are generally marked with (Posted) or (Pulled) in the item's subject so it is clear they are no longer active. Items can also be marked as (Ready) when the article is both updated and there seems to be a consensus to post. The posting admin, however, should always judge the update and the consensus to post themselves. If you find an entry that you don't feel is ready to post is marked (Ready), you should remove the mark in the header. Voicing an opinion on an item[edit] Format your comment to contain "support" or "oppose", and include a rationale for your choice. In particular, address the notability of the event, the quality of the article, and whether it has been updated. Please do not...[edit] add simple "support!" or "oppose!" votes without including your reasons. Similarly, curt replies such as "who?", "meh", or "duh!" are usually not helpful. Instead, explain the reasons why you think the item meets or does not meet the ITN inclusion criteria so a consensus can be reached. oppose an item because the event is only relating to a single country, or failing to relate to one. This applies to a high percentage of the content we post and is unproductive. accuse other editors of supporting, opposing or nominating due to a personal bias (such as ethnocentrism). Conflicts of interest are not handled at ITN. comment on a story without first reading the relevant article(s). oppose a recurring item here because you disagree with the recurring items criteria. The criteria can be discussed at the relevant talk page.

This is clearly a major tragedy which receives front-page coverage (ended up in an edit conflict while trying to nominate this myself).

The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 08:33, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose on quality right now the article is a stub, but I expect more information will come out at some point today, so article can be expanded. Event itself is ITN-worthy. Joseph2302 (talk) 10:00, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose It's a bus plunge and so just routine news. Andrew?(talk) 10:10, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Nope, it didn't "plunge", it crashed into a barrier and then caught fire, killing dozens of people. That's not routine anywhere. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 10:35, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Over a million people die on the roads every year – that's over 3,000 every day. The coverage of this case says that "there were often accidents in the area". It's routine. Andrew?(talk) 14:17, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Support on the merits; major tragedy receiving coverage, something which readers may be interested in learning more about. 331dot (talk) 10:17, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Weak support for now. Article is short, but just barely over stub stage. It appears to be fully referenced and not missing any details from what is known now. If the article is expanded as more information comes out (i.e. investigation etc.), consider this a full support. Reliable news agencies are covering the story. --Jayron32 13:11, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Support - per high number of deaths.

Joseph2302 (talk) 08:35, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Not terrorism, according to "sources", so whilst tragic, it appears to be a worse-than-usual crime gone wrong. Black Kite (talk) 08:44, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support -- It seems that around five people died in the attack. The perpetrator has been reported by a few media outlets as Daniel Brooks, a black man who raps under the name "MathboiFly" and has tons of social media posts supporting BLM, and this was in the aftermath of a very notable event where Rittenhouse was cleared as killing two black men in self-defence. OldPeace7068 (talk) 09:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Complete extrapolation. Police have said they believe he was on the run having committed a separate crime, nothing to do with Rittenhouse at all. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 09:35, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Wikipedia is there to report the facts. Police and many members of the public initially considered the possibility of Islamic terrorism due to similar incidents in the past involving Muslims, the targeting of a western festival, and the recent rise in Islamic terrorist activity, but police have now confirmed that this is not terrorism related. Similarly, there have been widespread links/controversy made between the rapper and his connections to BLM, and it has been linked to Rittenhouse whether you like it or not. It is part of the story. The killer is a major supporter and activist of BLM. And this happened in the aftermath of Rittenhouse's acquittal. It's all part of the background and developing story. OldPeace7068 (talk) 09:45, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Not at all. The police have stated he was fleeing a separate scene. Conflating this with BLM/Rittenhouse is pure crystal balling. Thanks. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 09:47, 22 November 2021 (UTC) "two black men" and you'd think we were on a website about facts... CharredWaffle (talk) 14:04, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. Calling this an "attack" may be a misnomer as it appears that the suspect was fleeing the police, not that it was a preplanned attack or terrorism. 331dot (talk) 12:50, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Maybe so. OTOH, at least one report quotes a witness as saying the vehicle seemed to be "targeting people" as it veered from side to side. Also, reports say it crashed through barriers to reach the parade, which seems to indicate that it was indeed an attack, though possibly not a pre-planned one. – Sca (talk) 16:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment The blurb should (and currently does not) mention the country in which this event took place. Chrisclear (talk) 12:56, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose - It's not at all clear that this is an act of terrorism, and thus not something that would be imminently notable.--WaltCip-(talk) 13:09, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose both on merit and article quality. As of this comment, the incident does not appear to have been a deliberate attack. I would be open to reconsideration if contrary information comes to light. Also, at present the article is little more than an oversized stub. It's not ready for the main page. -Ad Orientem (talk) 13:13, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support ... pending expansion of article, which presently comprises a mere 250 words, i.e. a stub. Seems to be the No. 1 story on main RS sites today. Note 40+ injuries. (Please spare me the de rigueur "U.S.-centric" harangue. This event is unusual and widely covered.) – Sca (talk) 14:34, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Not sure this deserves to be on the main page and the article doesn't look very good. ArsenalGhanaPartey (talk) 15:31, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment If the incident turns out not to be terrorist motivated, I honestly don't see it in Main Page, and if it's , with five dead, I 'mnot very clear, although the number of injured is dantesque. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 15:51, 22 November 2021 (UTC) If this is confirmed as an unfortunate series of events with no purposeful motivating factor (driver escaping from knife fight and inadvertently ran through parade crowd), then I would agree this is not really something that should be posted. This doesn't mean motiveless events can't ever be posted but I would expect the results to be more devasting (like the various major building fires or collapses that we had). --Masem (t) 16:36, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Exactly, I think the same Masem. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 17:30, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Wait – As an AP update seems to suggest this was the act of a lone nutcase with a record, I've withdrawn my provisonal support. However, it seems we're still in a wait situation, since nine of the injured are listed in critical condition. If the toll were to rise to double digits, we might still want to consider a blurb about this very nasty event. – Sca (talk) 18:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support if the motivation turns out to be terrorism, neutral if otherwise. Mlb96 (talk) 19:04, 22 November 2021 (UTC) A post – by an IT user with no other contributions – on our article's talk page posits racial motivation. Seems highly dubious at this point, though. – Sca (talk) 19:08, 22 November 2021 (UTC) See WP:RS. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 19:11, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Please see expanded comment above. Thanks. – Sca (talk) 19:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support. This event is in the news and the article looks to be in good shape. -- Tavix (talk) 19:38, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: – Since perp's been ID'd & police say he'll face five counts of first-degree intentional homicide, this is looking potentially more significant. – Sca (talk) 20:02, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Per The Independent this guy had a domestic dispute, and drove his car like a lunatic. Not terror-related, just an idiot behind the wheel. Not significant, tragic, but will never make the top 1000 things that happened on Planet Earth in 2021, let alone the top 250. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support - a mass-casualty event, receiving international coverage (e.g., BBC), a suspect is being charged, and the article has been improved to sufficient quality. Levivich 20:04, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support - rare (even in the US) mass-casualty event. Article quality is decent. Destroyeraa (Alternate account) 20:28, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment a road traffic accident in the US is not rare. Mass-casualty events in the US are far from rare. It's pretty obvious that giving this tragic yet non-terrorist/non-BLM/non-protest/non-deliberate accident undue prominence is not what the encyclopedia was designed to do. Of course, you can dig into the BBC website and find coverage, it's all "shock and think of the children" in the US, but the rest of the world has moved on the moment it was clear it was a sad instance of a crime somewhere else having shitty side-effects, and literally nothing more. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) The last time I remember a similar incident happened in the US was late 2017 when somebody plowed into a crowd in Virginia after a violent demonstration got broken up. We posted the event that it was tangentially related to, largely on the strength of somebody plowing their car into a crowd and killing someone. You supported posting it. Rockphed (talk) 01:03, 23 November 2021 (UTC) If you're referring to Charlottesville car attack, that was about a man deliberately setting out to ram people. This is about a man trying to escape the scene of a domestic incident and getting into a road traffic accident. The two are incomparable. But good try. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 08:07, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Agreeing with previous posters, posting this event would seem to be giving undue weight to a tragic traffic accident. Comparison with the Charlottesville incident from several years back is unfair, given the explicitly political motivations of the earlier event. Wizardoftheyear (talk) 01:17, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Neutral and Wait Yes, with the additional details that have come to light, this is literally a domestic issue that had decidedly more tragic consequences. However, that is additional details. The initial response, and the fact there were several fatalities during a celebration, caught on camera and shared around the world before anyone knew what was going on, has made this major news and a source of intrigue. I think we need to wait to see if the news stations drop their coverage now that there is less intrigue and crisis; if it has effectively left the news cycle by end of day, take this as an oppose, but if it is still on the news banners, take this as support. Kingsif (talk) 01:42, 23 November 2021 (UTC) 4 of the 12 paragraphs in this article start "On November 2X". Typical anti-American bias from the Brits (which is far from rare) notwithstanding, the quality is not there yet. GreatCaesarsGhost 02:23, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Support - Tragic, criminally-induced mass-casualty. Significant details are now known. CoatCheck (talk) 03:03, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Wait It's very clear that there won't be consensus as is, but there may be more of one as things develop. Wait for now. DarkSide830 (talk) 03:46, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Strong Support. This is the deadliest vehicle ramming incident in the United States or Canada since 2018 and the deadliest in the US since 2017. 142.182.136.105 (talk) 07:37, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Comment I see there's been a tragic bus crash in Bulgaria which has killed at least 45 people. It would be safe to presume that supporters of this accident would support the posting of the Bulgarian crash, right? The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 08:09, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Nominate an article on it so that I can assess the quality. Without knowing what we are posting on the main page, it is impossible for me to know if the article is appropriate. --Jayron32 12:56, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Four hours ago....

Leaning toward support, for all the diff that would make here. – Sca (talk) 13:49, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Support for multiple fatalities, high number of serious injuries, and widespread news coverage. Jehochman Talk 13:50, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose A tragic event, but it is not a mass-casualty event. ArsenalGhanaPartey (talk) 14:11, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Comment - We have support and oppose !votes that directly contradict each other in terms of the notability of this event. Some say this is very notable. Others say this is not at all notable. How is an admin supposed to derive consensus from this? --WaltCip-(talk) 15:05, 23 November 2021 (UTC) By executive fiat. – Sca (talk) 15:44, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Well most of the support votes are from Americans (of those who have userpages), and almost all of the opposes are from non-Americans. So I guess it'll be a coin toss on whether an American or non-American admin decides... Joseph2302 (talk) 15:49, 23 November 2021 (UTC) How about one from a neutral country, say Liechtenstein? – Sca (talk) 16:19, 23 November 2021 (UTC) I voted to oppose as an American ArsenalGhanaPartey (talk) 16:02, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Oh, you must be from Manchester, N.H., then. – Sca (talk) 16:24, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. This at first got attention because it might have been terrorism related, no problem there. But all we are left with now is an accident which leaves 5 death: while tragic, this is sadly an everyday occurrence. We have e.g. this week a ferry accident in Sri Lanka (at least 6 death)[2], 7 death in Greece when migrants flee the police[3], 22 deaths on Lake Kivu[4], nine deaths in a fire in Bulgaria[5], 10 deaths in China after a car crash[6], ... I see no reason to post this, as it is not exceptional, has no lasting importance, and isn't even very interesting (without the terrorism angle). It's a sad tragedy, but a very common one. Fram (talk) 17:03, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. Per Fram, tragic, but not significant enough at a global scale: we don't even have articles about many similar tragedies elsewhere.

Scaramouche33 (talk) 07:32, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, heads of state elections are posted even if they are ceremonial/wield little power, it mostly depends on the article quality itself which should be more than sufficient. Two examples are the Italian presidental election and Czech presidental election, both having similar powers to the Bulgarian one. [7] [8] BastianMAT (talk) 09:02, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Weak support this article has been on front page for a week already, but I guess the second round presidency vote means that it's ITN eligible again. Article looks to have been sufficiently updated about the presidential second round vote. Joseph2302 (talk) 12:10, 22 November 2021 (UTC) This is not ITNR. We no longer post all elections for head of state- we post the election/choosing of the official with actual executive power, according to List of current heads of state and government; in Bulgaria that is the PM, not the president. 331dot (talk) 12:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) In which case, I oppose this nomination, and it shouldn't have been tagged as ITNR. Joseph2302 (talk) 12:37, 22 November 2021 (UTC) In fairness, it is a recent change that not everyone may be aware of. 331dot (talk) 12:41, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Alright, I thought going by older posts that head of state elections are still part of ITNR but if its been removed, no problem and thanks for the headsup for future nominations. BastianMAT (talk) 12:46, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I just saw this now. I must have missed the change or forgot about it. So my comment on other presidents is not relevant here. --Tone 17:49, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Exactly, that’s what got me confused to when I ITNR nominated this. In the past as you and I mentioned, similar head of state elections (with similar powers) such as Moldova(November 2020), Germany, Austria, Italy, Czech Republic have been posted. 331dot said the removal of ceremonial head of state elections from ITNR were ’recently’ done, so the change must have not been too long ago for us to not know that.BastianMAT (talk) 18:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Blurb on MainPage was updated and moved up --PFHLai (talk) 13:11, 22 November 2021 (UTC) PFHLai there wasn't consensus to do this update- the presidential election is not ITNR, and there was not consensus here that it's important enough for ITN. We should leave it where it is, so it can roll off soon, instead of moving it up so it'll stay on ITN for another week... Joseph2302 (talk) 13:27, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Post posting support If the election was stand-alone, we would probably post it. This is just the case where the general election were held together with the first round of presidential, so there is a single article. I don't see a problem. --Tone 14:56, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I doubt we would post this as a standalone item. He may be head of state, but he has no power. It's the Prime Minister of Bulgaria who would be posted automatically.  — Amakuru (talk) 17:18, 22 November 2021 (UTC) In fact he has been in de facto power since the 2021 April elections as he appointed his friend as acting prime minister. The de jure power he wields is similar to those in Italy and Czech Republic, where he gets to nominate the prime minister and supreme court judges, he can veto laws (although parliament can override) and he of course serves as head of state, don’t forget Bulgaria even has a vice president. In the past we have posted the Italian presidental and Czech Republic presidental elections, both are parliamantary republics too. I thought it was ITNR, but 331dot mentioned that head of state elections (where the head of state is not head of goverment) was recently removed from ITNR. Italian presidental election posted Czech Republic presidental election posted BastianMAT (talk) 17:32, 22 November 2021 (UTC) (ec) As far as I remember we post both if the articles are ok. We've posted presidents of Austria and Germany, which have a similar role, for example. Furthermore, the president of Germany is elected by Bundestag, not by a popular vote. --Tone 17:36, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Pull update and Revert back to previous version per Joseph2302. This guy is just a figure head, and we already posted the main election result. There was no reason to have bumped this up, and the result is not ITN/R so needs consensus, which it doesn't have.  — Amakuru (talk) 17:14, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Pull update and agree with above, not seeing consensus here for this to have even been posted in the first instance. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 17:21, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Beyond the issue of whether it should be on the main page, the blurb is clumsy. "In Bulgaria," is redundant. Where else but in Bulgaria would you be elected President of Bulgaria? Schwede66 17:57, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Restored old blurb. --PFHLai (talk) 18:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose pull Not a head of state change but in the same spirit This post was made by orbitalbuzzsaw gang (talk) 19:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment I think we need some kind of page break to restart voting.

GreatCaesarsGhost 21:55, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I didn't particularly mind about the unilateral action myself - it was made in good faith - and my oppose is purely on the merits of the case, for much the same reasons as you.

(Post) Alternative blurb: ?Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai is reported missing after accusing former Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli of sexual assault. News source(s): Guardian Credits: Nominated by Blythwood (talk · give credit) Article updatedNominator's comments: Seems to be a forced disappearance. This is a bit unusual, but has been a major news story. Disappearance section seems solid but the rest of the article on her career is less well sourced. The person has disappeared without a trace, so while it cannot be verified that this person person has died or been imprisoned, her disappearance is in itself the notable event. I wonder if this could be treated as something like the equivalent of a recent death. Blythwood (talk) 22:39, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support - Article is in good condition and the news is prominent, exceptional, and of great public interest around the world. Jehochman Talk 22:45, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose - Article appear in news, but headlines on CBC, CNN, BBC are still focused on Rittenhouse Trial for now, although this may change. Otherwise, the blurb should describe whats happening now (the reactions), that she has not been publicly heard is not ITN as that is a few days old. 99.247.176.90 (talk) 23:06, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose - I fail to see how this is any more worthy of ITN than the Rittenhouse trial, which was also not worthy of ITN. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 23:10, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Please don't oppose because you think another nomination should be posted and you don't think this one is as worthy. Judge nomination on its own merit. The two are about completely different things. -- KTC (talk) 23:12, 19 November 2021 (UTC) I don't think either are worthy of being posted. --RockstoneSend me a message! 01:20, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support per Jehochman. However I'm not quite sure about the term "disappears" here, even if I personally think the Chinese state did exactly that. -- KTC (talk) 23:16, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support per Jehochman. -- Tavix (talk) 23:20, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support this is far more notable than "another white American kills black Americans" and regardless of the fact that headlines are currently obsessing over the US proclivity to allow kids to routinely assassinate people without any kind of criminal conviction, Peng's disappearance is genuinely newsworthy and encyclopedic. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 23:23, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Not that it matters to this nomination, but Rittenhouse's victims were white. GreatCaesarsGhost 00:04, 20 November 2021 (UTC) *cough cough* Rittenhouse's victims were white *cough cough* – John M Wolfson (talk • contribs) 00:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Who said he wasn't talking about Young Dolph's routine assassin?

InedibleHulk (talk) 02:06, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose on quality The article needs a lot of work, as there are multiple sections with no inline citations.Pawnkingthree (talk) 23:42, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support While this might be unduly implicative of the Chinese state being connected, if RSs are making that connection this definitely belongs. – John M Wolfson (talk • contribs) 00:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose on quality I would support this if the article has some ref work done. There's sections that are unsourced. --TDKR Chicago 101 (talk) 00:34, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose this is newsworthy for sure but blurbing that someone "disappeared" after making an accusation seems like a WP:BLPCRIME issue to me. --LaserLegs (talk) 00:39, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Completely agree it's an awkward thing to summarise in a way that fits BLP while keeping it clear why the event is notable, I'd welcome suggestions for alternative phrasing. I realise this is a fairly limited action, but for that reason I deliberately didn't link to the person she accused in the proposed blurb. Blythwood (talk) 01:57, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose as per LaserLegs, there's something wrong about posting speculation that someone disappeared straight after they made accusations. With little reliable information, this seems like a BLP issue to post it. Joseph2302 (talk) 01:47, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Far too speculative, with overtones of anti-China sentiment, and with too many unknowns. Needs far more clarification before it is posted. And a guarantee that ITN will publish a full We Were Wrong! statement and retraction on the Main page when it is found out she has just eloped with her boyfriend or girlfriend, as the case may be. HiLo48 (talk) 01:55, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Clearly if China "disappeared" her, that would be a story, but this appears to be Western nations making a demand of China and there's no hard evidence she has been killed or imprisoned or the like. We don't post this type of speculative stories. --Masem (t) 02:16, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support Per wide coverage in RSes. Normchou?? 03:22, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose unless the incident has a separate article. Sun8908?Talk 07:38, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support — article looks decent enough for ITN standards by my eye, wide coverage in RSes. If the choice of "disappears" is undesirable, then "is reported missing" might be a potential alternative (posted as altblurb). [osunpokeh/talk/contributions] 08:41, 20 November 2021 (UTC) I think that suggests she was reported missing in the police report sense, not that Novak Djokovic described her as "a missing person" to reporters. Not a bad idea. Just a bit ambiguous. InedibleHulk (talk) 09:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Strong support, in the news, top page news in many countries. The issue is she has suddenly disappeared after accusing a senior cabinet minister of a serious crime, and the involved parties are public figures indept of this incident, so there is nothing wrong as long as it is sourced and not stated as truth. Peng's disappearance and the resulting sports diplomacy pressure and boycott threats are sufficient Bumbubookworm (talk) 12:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Have you ever studied the difference between correlation and causation?

Something that may have happened isn't blurbworthy, no matter how widely it's hyped. – Sca (talk) 13:05, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose per Masem, Sca.

Polyamorph (talk) 20:03, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support per above. The article has unref'd sections about her tennis career, but the linked section is ready. Davey2116 (talk) 21:52, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. We shouldn't (and don't) post articles with multiple unsourced sections. The fact that the section linked in bold is referenced is irrelevant. Black Kite (talk) 23:26, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Wait Let's wait until we are 100% sure what has happened to her. Heythereimaguy (talk) 23:53, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Global Times continues to point to her, this time at a restaurant with a coach and friends, seemingly quite visible. Western speculation now turns to whether she's safe, though, or free from external interference or to be believed. All very personal and hard-to-answer questions, for anybody anywhere. InedibleHulk (talk) 00:10, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose it's just one person in a world where much worse things happen in other places like Ethiopia. Banedon (talk) 01:11, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose for now. Videos of Peng Shuai have supposedly surfaced. Nice4What (talk · contribs) – (Thanks ?) 03:30, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Support However, I propose removing the term 'Chinese' in front of Peng Shuai. It does not add to her character or her identity as a professional tennis player. Something along the lines of "Professional tennis player Peng Shuai disappears after accusing former Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli of sexual assault." would be better imo. However, we should also note the videos posted by Global Times editors (primarily those tweeted by editor-in-chief Hu Xijin) and their aftermath. JMonkey2006 (talk) 11:10, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – She's reappeared, online at least. End of story? – Sca (talk) 13:34, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Strong support Wide coverage by RSes and notable. Fakescientist8000 (talk) 14:05, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Still too murky and speculative, with little general impact. – Sca (talk) 15:24, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Leaving aside anything else, there is video evidence of her out and about so she hasn't been "disappeared" and isn't "missing". Whether or not something else is happening is in the realm of speculation, and would require a separate blurb. Also, very large swathes of the article on her career lack even a single citation. Is it not time to close this as no consensus already? Preceding posted by User:BSMRD – Sca (talk) 17:35, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: – Discussion tops 1,500 words. Posts running 4:3 against. – Sca (talk) 17:42, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Comment as nominator I'm willing to close soon now there's video of her alive (barring any big development, like it rapidly emerging this is an impersonator). Someone being in big trouble with their government isn't ITN-worthy, although I still think someone being forced-disappeared could be.

This applies to a high percentage of the content we post and is unproductive. – Muboshgu (talk) 19:04, 19 November 2021 (UTC) (edit conflict):*See the instructions above "Please do not...oppose an item because the event is only relating to a single country, or failing to relate to one. This applies to a high percentage of the content we post and is unproductive." "International notability" is not a criteria for posting at ITN, nor has it ever been. --Jayron32 19:05, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Well my direct opinion is that it is not notable. My reasoning is the discussion that already took place on the 2021 talk page. I also have previous discussions months ago where things highly notable to one country aren’t included. Elijahandskip (talk) 19:11, 19 November 2021 (UTC) This is not a discussion of the page 2021. The criteria established for other parts of Wikipedia don't apply here. If you wish to change the criteria used for the ITN box, then start a discussion at WT:ITN. Votes without valid rationales are given little weight. It's fine if you have a useful rationale, but merely "I don't think it's notable enough" does not provide any useful guidance to admins when deciding consensus. I mean, you're allowed to say any silly thing you want, I suppose, but you can't expect anyone to take you seriously if it isn't valid. --Jayron32 19:18, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Well since you don’t like my reasoning, just let me say “no”. People have supported ITN’s in the past without giving a reason, so my “Oppose” in this case will not have a reason. Elijahandskip (talk) 19:22, 19 November 2021 (UTC) As I said, it's a free world. People do nonsensical things all of the time. --Jayron32 19:24, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Yep, I couldn’t agree more. In reality, my oppose on this comes more to combat American Wikipedia vs English Wikipedia. There is a essay on Wikipedia that I recently read that has that meaning. Not everything that happens in America is notable for Wikipedia/2021/ITN/Portal Current Events, etc….Elijahandskip (talk) 19:34, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose (at least on news of just the verdict). It was a highly watched case in the U.S., but it was clear early on to many legal experts that are crying foul on judicial behavior. It is very very likely to see an appeal and so this is not the end. This is not like the result from the very public George Floyd protests (which we posted and had ongoing about those, and the verdict). That said, there had been concerns there may be rioting following an acquittal , and while I'm not seeing any immediate news on that, a major riot (akin to the LA riots after King's verdict) would likely be the newsworthy factor here. --Masem (t) 19:05, 19 November 2021 (UTC) There literally cannot be any appeal of a not guilty verdict. This is a core principle of how double jeopardy is handled in American jurisprudence. A not guilty jury verdict is basically always final. See [9]. There are some exceedingly rare exceptions to this, but none of them would apply in this case. An ordinary jury verdict of "not guilty" like this one (even in a controversial trial) is treated as basically sacrosanct, and there can be no appeals by the government. --Jayron32 19:08, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Except for the calls for a mistrial that are being entered now. I know there's complexities with double jeopardy there, but that's still on the books and that itself can be a legal process. --Masem (t) 19:15, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Um, what? There were calls for a mistrial by Rittenhouse's defense team prior to the jury verdict coming back. Now that the verdict is in their client's favor, I doubt highly they will press forward with these requests. Indeed, articles such as this one note "The verdict also meant that Judge Bruce Schroeder did not have to rule on the defense's motions for a mistrial." --Jayron32 19:23, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose as above. If we had to have an American court psychodrama today, the better option from a world-historical perspective would probably be the acquittal of the purported killers of Malcolm X. —Brigade Piron (talk) 19:20, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose AGF, but this is such a small story in the grand scheme. GreatCaesarsGhost 19:23, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Wait. It is too early to tell what impact this will have.

(Post) News source(s): AP, WSJ Credits: Nominated by Indefensible (talk · give credit) Updated by Dracophyllum (talk · give credit) and DiplomatTesterMan (talk · give credit) Nominator's comments: This article was previously in ongoing, now has a noteworthy update which should bring it towards conclusion. - Indefensible (talk) 06:50, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: One of the major farmers' unions behind the protests, Bharatiya Kisan Union, has promised to continue protesting till the laws are actually repealed (source). I wonder if we should put this blurb up now, or when Parliament repeals them and the farmers go home (don't have strong opinions either way, but I lean towards waiting). If we're going to put it up now, I've uploaded this screengrab of Modi's announcement from his CC-BY YouTube channel; we could use it. Btw Indefensible - Dracophyllum was the only updater, not DiplomatTesterMan. Kind regards, W. Tell DCCXLVI (talk to me!/c) 07:05, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Using the update to put back in ongoing instead of a final blurb would be fine too if preferable. And DiplomatTesterMan did more updates on the article before that, he still deserves some credit too I think. - Indefensible (talk) 07:12, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose because the article is not sufficiently updated. There is currently a 1 sentence mention in the lead of the repeal of the laws, and no mention of it, nor of any follow-on protests, anywhere in the body of the article. Before this can be posted, the latest developments would need to be added to the article appropriately. --Jayron32 12:18, 19 November 2021 (UTC) @Jayron32 Have you read the repeal section? Dracophyllum 20:10, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Your response is 8 hours after Jayron32's, Dracophyllum. The section may have not existed when Jayron commented. But then again, I am not going to take the time to check if it did exist at 12:18 PM UTC on 19 Nov 2021. Tube·of·Light 02:30, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: The announcement by itself has no legal value. Parliament has to repeal the laws, which it will probably do in the coming Winter Session. Also some farmer's unions are continuing protests until the laws are repealed and minimum support prices reconsidered. So it might be better to wait, but no strong opinion either way. --Jose Mathew (talk) 12:24, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Wait and see what the impact of this is.

India-centric Very India centric. It's probably not even the most important news in India right now, let alone the world. Actually not even sure this is going to be more than a couple days' news in India "Please do not oppose an item because the event is only relating to a single country, or failing to relate to one. This applies to a high percentage of the content we post and is unproductive." 331dot (talk) 23:11, 19 November 2021 (UTC) It's important to remember that 1/7 of the people on this planet are Indians. We don’t post a great deal of India related stories. 331dot (talk) 23:13, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Interestingly I didn't see the same PDM feedback from you above for another "country-centric" nomination from the worlds third most populous country. In fact, we do post many India-centric stories here, this one having festered in ongoing for nearly a year. --LaserLegs (talk) 23:36, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support. Invariably it is announcements that get more attention than the actual act, most of the time(we post elections when the result is known, not when the results are official/certified). If Modi renegs, that will likely be newsworthy itself. 331dot (talk) 23:16, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Weak oppose - as Wilhelm Tell DCCXLVI says, the BKU is still protesting. I would prefer waiting till the laws are actually repealed (and FWIW, these laws are being repealed just before the 2022 Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly elections and elections in some other states, which are crucial for Modi's political party). Tube·of·Light 02:30, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – On article quality – and as others have noted because the laws haven't taken effect. The article, at more than 10,000 words, is grossly overwritten, overblown and overweight – presumably by partisans who view the topic as a cause célèbre that calls for a crusade. – Sca (talk) 13:20, 20 November 2021 (UTC) (Closed) November 2021 lunar eclipse[edit] Consensus will not develop to post this.

The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 21:41, 19 November 2021 (UTC) You're forgetting that lunar eclipses often presage globally cataclysmic events, such as permanent cancellation of The Boat Race, which I fear may now be in the offing for 2022. – Sca (talk) 13:30, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Of course, lunar eclipses and the Boat Race are entirely unrelated. And of course, there will be no "permanent cancellation of The Boat Race", that's total bollocks, but perhaps inline with your regular contributions. As you perhaps should know already, The Boat Race 2022 is scheduled for next year, and if COVID stymies it, one imagines it will simply be moved to the River Great Ouse once again. I'm unclear as to where you think that a lunar eclipse would be a portent for the permanent cancellation of an event which has been conducted since 1829, even before the Third Reich failed to play nicely. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 17:56, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Ease up, Ramblo, it was a joke. (And BTW, the Third Reich and this topic are entirely unrelated.) – Sca (talk) 18:26, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Yeah, and this topic and the Boat Race are completely unrelated. And it wasn't funny in any sense. So explain yourself. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 18:45, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support, this lunar eclipse has gotten significant news coverage.

The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:42, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Wait Living through this, it's a pretty devastating disaster, with all road access cut off to and from the Port of Vancouver, which is having a major impact on supply chains across Western Canada. But I don't think this meets the standard previously set for ITN just yet, although there are reports that the death toll is expected to rise. There's also reports of an imminent dike breach into a large city. As such, I'd suggest that we wait. NorthernFalcon (talk) 22:51, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – Lots of damage & dislocation but so far only one fatal. – Sca (talk) 23:29, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Wait If this gets worse and deadlier, then I will support. Heythereimaguy (talk) 13:02, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Wait per NorthernFalcon & Sca. Modest Genius talk 13:16, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Comment I would further comment that given Port of Vancouver is affected (the fourth largest port in North America by volume of goods) the supply chain issues are pretty notable. [14] CaffeinAddict (talk) 23:11, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, just “affected” the fourth in North America. Not America. Not even in the world. Let's not overestimate it. Storms are storms, and it happen...a lot of things. International impact is very low. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 01:52, 21 November 2021 (UTC) The discussion above is closed. Please do not modify it.

(Post) Alternative blurb: ?Russia shoots down Kosmos 1408 with an anti-satellite weapon, creating a field of space debris. Alternative blurb II: ?Kosmos 1408 is destroyed by a Russian anti-satellite weapon and turned into a stream of space debris. News source(s): BBC, AP, Reuters, Guardian, Bloomberg Credits: Nominated by Andrew Davidson (talk · give credit) Created by Mike Peel (talk · give credit) Updated by Smeagol 17 (talk · give credit) Article updated Nominator's comments: We have some real news about the ISS now as the crew have to take shelter from a shower of debris created by a Russian missile test. And the Kessler syndrome advances another notch. What we're mainly missing is a good picture but we might use something generic like this. Andrew?(talk) 12:56, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support in principle, as this is a significant event for the space industry (more so than Crew-3 that we already have on the template). However the article is pretty lightweight and could use some expansion. It also needs a source for the claim that Russia was responsible for the test - we can't claim something in the blurb that isn't cited in the article. I would also remove 'dangerous' from the blurb as that's quite a strong accusation. Modest Genius talk 13:05, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Article seems fine now, though as I was one of the users updating it an independent assessment would be welcome. Modest Genius talk 18:16, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support on the merits; the use of an anti-satellite weapon(even as a test) is rare and few countries possess such technology. Russia isn't denying it. 331dot (talk) 13:10, 16 November 2021 (UTC) @331dot: Yes, the use is rare and few countries possess such technology. Yet, I remember a similar test from India a couple of years ago was rejected as the technology "has been around for a while." If I recall correctly, there had been significant debate about debris back then too. 2405:201:4013:8087:A828:E291:B9B5:4B09 (talk) 18:31, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I can only comment on the nomination in front of me; I can't speak to past ones at this time. 331dot (talk) 19:15, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support in principle though article needs to include that Russia shot it down (right now, the article just says it broke up). And other cn tags in article would need fixing. Though I agree, this is way more important/notable/covered in news sources than Crew-3. Joseph2302 (talk) 13:12, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Comment I started putting this through DYK earlier today, see Template:Did you know nominations/Kosmos 1408, since I haven't enjoyed participating in previous ITN discussions. But if you want this here, then the DYK can be withdrawn. I've updated the template above, since I started the article yesterday. Thanks. Mike Peel (talk) 13:14, 16 November 2021 (UTC) One option would be to merge this into the existing Crew-3 ISS mission blurb. If Kosmos 1408 is not bolded then it can still be a DYK too. Andrew?(talk) 13:22, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I oppose merging those blurbs - these are separate events. Modest Genius talk 14:07, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I also oppose merging- they're separate events, and this one is more important, so shouldn't be stuck on the end of some less important and newswirthy article that's only on the front page because it was alledgedly ITNR (even though that ITNR criteria was demonstrated to be unfit for purpose). And if this does reach front page, then DYK would no longer be eligible, but until that point, don't see a need to withdraw the DYK nom. Joseph2302 (talk) 14:30, 16 November 2021 (UTC) We could remove the Crew-3 blurb and replace it with this one when this is ready to go (assuming Crew-3 is still on ITN). Yeah, it doesn't get its "full time" there, but I agree that it doesn't make sense to merge, but having two ISS-related things could be seen as overwhelming the box. --Masem (t) 14:35, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – Fairly widely covered, but broader significance of a "threat" to the ISS isn't so apparent. – Sca (talk) 13:38, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Even a fleck of paint could seriously damage the ISS, one of the most expensive objects ever constructed. 331dot (talk) 11:14, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support in principle. This is very significant news and an interesting story of high encyclopedic value.--Kiril Simeonovski (talk) 13:41, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support in principle per above, just needs better fleshing out of the article. --Masem (t) 13:53, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – Upon reflection, it seems to be a serious threat all right, but ... can we post something that hasn't had a tangible effect ... yet? – Sca (talk) 14:11, 16 November 2021 (UTC) PS: My question is, did Putin authorize this stupid 'test' – or was it just an act of heedless military apparatchiks down in the bureaucracy? (Russia is an oligarchy that has a country – a country that has an enormous military.) – Sca (talk) 14:19, 16 November 2021 (UTC) The way I'm reading it, the story is more that Russia has appeared to have violated a treaty related to space-bound weapons, in addition to this being a story of interest to space exploration (the potential of damage to the ISS that forced the crew to shelter for at least two orbits as it passed through the debris field). --Masem (t) 14:17, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Reasonable enough. However, the threat to human lives (including two Russians!) seems more compelling in terms of reader interest. – Sca (talk) 14:22, 16 November 2021 (UTC) From our article on the Outer Space Treaty: "Although it forbids establishing military bases, testing weapons and conducting military maneuvers on celestial bodies, the treaty does not expressly ban all military activities in space, nor the establishment of military space forces or the placement of conventional weapons in space". Testing an anti-satellite weapon on your own target is not against any treaty, just regarded as irresponsible. Note that the US, China and India have all conducted similar tests with no legal repercussions or UN censure. Modest Genius talk 15:09, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose no longer fresh, not really in the news, rolled off a while ago and probably better suited for DYK. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 16:11, 16 November 2021 (UTC) What's your time frame for "no longer fresh"? The BBC article is only 12 hours old and the event itself occurred yesterday. It's certainly a newer event than anything currently in the ITN box... --Jayron32 16:16, 16 November 2021 (UTC) (edit conflict) The BBC published two more articles about this story in just the last hour [15] [16]. That seems pretty fresh. Modest Genius talk 16:19, 16 November 2021 (UTC) It happened yesterday, and is very much still in the news. Much more so than the posted blurbs, such as the NYC Marathon on 7 November for example. Joseph2302 (talk) 16:20, 16 November 2021 (UTC) OH sure, you can dig into websites and find more analysis, but it's not headline news and hasn't been for most of the day now. Even the article makes it clear that the "main event" has passed. Biggest headlines in the UK are now that Johnson is proposing to prevent MPs from getting paid consultancy jobs. This story is no longer even on the BBC News homepage. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 16:24, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Support Article is short, but sufficient; it seems to have developed some since the earlier notes. Topic is being covered by reliable news sources. --Jayron32 16:17, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose ... for now. Article text comprises 340 words, of which 115 are background, leaving a mere 230 words about the current threat. IMO, too thin for MP promotion. Second, we shouldn't blurb something that hasn't had an impact (yet). – Sca (talk) 17:03, 16 November 2021 (UTC) PS: Given that the current situation could continue for quite some time, perhaps after a bit we should consider posting this directly to Ongoing. – Sca (talk) 17:10, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Whatever political fallout there has been is pretty much so far just a short but important burst (for blurb posting), but there's no sign this is going to escalate into something further, in comparison to the nuclear submarine sale a few months back. --Masem (t) 19:50, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Wait is there a real danger debris hits other satellites soon, or is this just "an abundance of caution"? Will there be significant geo-political ramifications from the test? Until one of those is "yes", I think we should wait. User:? (powera, ?, ?) 19:52, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Everywhere is at risk for disaster, but this info is nothing like disaster actually happening. Political story, and involving two countries who always bicker. Could change if the ISS is destroyed or something stronger than words breaks out. InedibleHulk (talk) 20:46, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Is this an RD nom for the destruction of Kosmos 1408? If so, its "career section" needs an expansion to describe how it was used while still in orbit and operational.--PFHLai (talk) 23:08, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Questionable significance as far as potential impacts, especially given at the moment it is just predictive. I would assume that the test itself is not sufficient for ITN, so I'm on the "Oppose" side here. DarkSide830 (talk) 00:01, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support even if nothing happens to the ISS, ASAT weapon tests don't happen every day, or even every year. Banedon (talk) 03:44, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support Certainly magnitudes more important than the multitude of launches posted every now and then on ITN. Gotitbro (talk) 07:09, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support significant, made the news and the article Kosmos 1408 is short but adequate. Given the military nature of this satellite and its destruction, we can't expect to know that many details. Of the proposed blurbs, only alt 1 is good. --LukeSurl t c 10:02, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support in principle this is a significant story BUT it simply cannot be posted with a blurb of this quality. Its language is misleading and makes it sound as if a functional satellite was attacked, but rather a defunct satellite was destroyed as part of a weapons test... slightly different. Possibly also include the name of the missile system, if known, and replace "Russia" with the actual agency overseeing the test. JMonkey2006 (talk) 11:10, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Feel free to propose a different blurb. Or we could simply add 'defunct' before the name of the satellite. Modest Genius talk 11:38, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – Absent from main RS sites on Wednesday; no longer in the news. Seems a minor issue without tangible effects. Neither target article is really about this event. – Sca (talk) 12:42, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support in principle per JMonkey. Fakescientist8000 (talk) 13:54, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support. The Kessler syndrome may have been triggered: "The Kessler syndrome is troublesome because of the domino effect and feedback runaway wherein impacts between objects of sizable mass spall off debris from the force of the collision. The fragments can then hit other objects, producing even more space debris: if a large enough collision or explosion were to occur, such as between a space station and a defunct satellite, or as the result of hostile actions in space, then the resulting debris cascade could make prospects for long-term viability of satellites in particular low Earth orbits extremely low." Count Iblis (talk) 14:52, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Support - Russia is weaponizing space. Whether or not they were the first to do it - and presumably they weren't - this is an indication of a change in global affairs when it comes to outer space.--WaltCip-(talk) 16:16, 17 November 2021 (UTC) If you didn't know (see anti-satellite weapon), the first ASAT test was in 1959, and was conducted by the US. Banedon (talk) 02:06, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Comment any admins around here to post this? I oppose its inclusion as it's already stale in my opinion, but there's a pretty clear consensus here and the longer it's left unposted, the staler it becomes.... The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 16:21, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Posted altblurb2. --PFHLai (talk) 17:36, 17 November 2021 (UTC) The space junkies emerge triumphant. – Sca (talk) 18:23, 17 November 2021 (UTC)  ;-) References[edit] Nominators often include links to external websites and other references in discussions on this page.

This is not the page to report errors in the ITN section on the Main Page—please go to the appropriate section at WP:ERRORS. Archives of past nominations can be found here. This candidates page is integrated with the daily pages of Portal:Current events. Under each daily section header below is the transcluded Portal:Current events items for that day (with a light green header). Each day's portal page is followed by a subsection for suggestions and discussion. A blurb is a one sentence summary of the news story. An alternate suggestion for the blurb is called an altblurb, and any more suggestions get labelled alt1, alt2, etc. A blurb needs at least one target article, highlighted in bold; reviewers check the quality of that article and whether it is updated, and whether reliable sources demonstrate the significance of the event. Other articles can also be linked. The Ongoing line is for regularly updated articles which cover events that remain in the news over a longer period of time. RD stands for the "recent deaths" line, and can include any living thing whose death was recently announced. In some cases, recent deaths may need additional explanation as provided by a blurb; this is decided by consensus.

Find the correct section below for the date of the event (not the date nominated). Do not add sections for new dates. These are automatically generated (at midnight UTC) by a bot; creating them manually breaks this process. Nominate the blurb for ITN inclusion under the "Suggestions" subheading for the date, emboldening the link in the blurb to the updated article. Use a level 4 header (====) when doing so. Preferably use the template {{ITN candidate}} to nominate the article related to the event in the news. Make sure that you include a reference from a verifiable, reliable secondary source. Press releases are not acceptable. The suggested blurb should be written in simple present tense. Adding an explanation why the event should be posted greatly increases the odds of posting. Please consider alerting editors to the nomination by adding the template {{ITN note}} to the corresponding article's talk page. Purge this page to update the cache There are criteria which guide the decision on whether or not to put a particular item on In the news, based largely on the extensiveness of the updated content and the perceived significance of the recent developments. These are listed at WP:ITN. Submissions that do not follow the guidelines at Wikipedia:In the news will not be placed onto the live template. Headers[edit] Items that have been posted or pulled from the main page are generally marked with (Posted) or (Pulled) in the item's subject so it is clear they are no longer active. Items can also be marked as (Ready) when the article is both updated and there seems to be a consensus to post. The posting admin, however, should always judge the update and the consensus to post themselves. If you find an entry that you don't feel is ready to post is marked (Ready), you should remove the mark in the header. Voicing an opinion on an item[edit] Format your comment to contain "support" or "oppose", and include a rationale for your choice. In particular, address the notability of the event, the quality of the article, and whether it has been updated. Please do not...[edit] add simple "support!" or "oppose!" votes without including your reasons. Similarly, curt replies such as "who?", "meh", or "duh!" are usually not helpful. Instead, explain the reasons why you think the item meets or does not meet the ITN inclusion criteria so a consensus can be reached. oppose an item because the event is only relating to a single country, or failing to relate to one. This applies to a high percentage of the content we post and is unproductive. accuse other editors of supporting, opposing or nominating due to a personal bias (such as ethnocentrism).

I refer to here. Yet another case with zero international impact and interest, yet another case of a purely local trial. Far from being akin to the conviction for the murder of George Floyd. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 20:46, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Alsoriano97 If "international impact" was required for postings, very little would be posted. 331dot (talk) 20:47, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, but it should be much more decisive when it comes to court rulings than in other cases (sports, science, elections...). If the follow-up of a trial has a very low international coverage/interest, will you tell me that it's not an important requirement to take into account when determining whether a court case is blurb-worthy or not? So many people are condemned every day in this world... _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 20:58, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Respectfully, we aren't talking about someone convicted of robbing the corner store, but a black man who was murdered basically for being in the wrong neighborhood in a part of the United States where convictions for this sort of thing are rare. And as I said, this incident has influenced changes in laws. 331dot (talk) 21:55, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support. This was a highly followed trial in the US, and even before the verdict this incident resulted in changes in Georgia law(the elimination of citizens' arrests). 331dot (talk) 20:52, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Article is also of decent quality from what I can see. 331dot (talk) 20:57, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support -- this verdict is likely to influence future trials of this type in the United States, and it is an historic decision in an area of the country known for its virulent racism. I doubt a jury would have reached this verdict in that area even 20 years ago. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 21:47, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support High profile case with notable legal impact, quality article. SpencerT•C 21:55, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support.

Whilst? – Sca (talk) 19:58, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose for now. Article is not developed enough to be ready for the main page. If that is fixed, it can be posted. Also, none of the blurbs link the article. That will need to be fixed. --Jayron32 20:04, 24 November 2021 (UTC) fixed now Llewee (talk) 21:01, 24 November 2021 (UTC) (Removed) Ongoing removal: 2021 Belarus–European Union border crisis[edit] Article: 2021 Belarus–European Union border crisis (talk · history · tag) Ongoing item removal (Post) Nominator's comments: The article has not has any significant updates for a week, and thus fails the ongoing criteria: In order to be posted to ongoing, the article needs to be regularly updated with new, pertinent information. If there have been significant updates in the last week, these should be added, but right now, this article fails the ongoing criteria. In particular, the last significant update is older than the day of the oldest ITN event (21 November), which is a general rule for something not being updated enough for Ongoing. Joseph2302 (talk) 12:26, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Remove. I think Belarus cleared out migrants from the border; Putin must think he made his point. 331dot (talk) 12:28, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Remove. The migrants have been moved away from the border and the situation has calmed down. No longer an ongoing event. Modest Genius talk 13:05, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – Although the situation appears to have been at least partially defused, there have been reports in recent days that in some cases Belorussian guards have continued to help migrants breach the border into Polish territory. [1], [2] [3] – Sca (talk) 13:27, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Remove the existence of news coverage that Sca notes is a necessary but not sufficient condition for maintaining an ongoing link. The article also needs to have been continuously updated. That clearly didn't happen here. --Jayron32 20:06, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – I have read the reports mentioned by Sca. It appears as if the situation have slowed down, but not ended. So still Ongoing.BabbaQ (talk) 20:23, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Removed.

(Post) Alternative blurb: ?Following the resignation of Stefan Löfven, Magdalena Andersson (pictured) is elected by the Riksdag as the first female Prime Minister of Sweden. Alternative blurb II: ?Magdalena Andersson (pictured) is elected as the first female Prime Minister of Sweden. News source(s): BBC Credits: Nominated by BastianMAT (talk · give credit) Article updated The nominated event is listed on WP:ITN/R, so each occurrence is presumed to be important enough to post. Comments should focus on whether the quality of the article and update meet WP:ITNCRIT, not the significance. Nominator's comments: ITNR, as it falls under "Changes in the holder of the office which administer the executive of their respective state/government, in those countries which qualify under the criteria above, as listed at List of current heads of state and government except when that change was already posted as part of a general election". First female prime minister of Sweden. BastianMAT (talk) 09:59, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment she takes office on the 26th (according to her article). Until that point, the blurb isn't correct, as she only becomes the first female PM of Sweden on that date. Is it usual to post when it's announced, or when they take office? Joseph2302 (talk) 10:04, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Usually when they are elected but yeah with the blurb of being elected. BastianMAT (talk) 10:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support - First female PM in Sweden. But change blurb to ”is elected” instead becomes.BabbaQ (talk) 10:06, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Yes. BastianMAT (talk) 10:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support Significant as new PM and first female. Perhaps the blub should be "elected by the Riksdag" since she didn't gain office through a normal election (by the people). cart-Talk 10:15, 24 November 2021 (UTC) That's normal in a parliamentary system. – Sca (talk) 15:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment The blurb should probably start with "Following the resignation of Stefan Löfven, ..." to provide context, since this was not an election outcome but a government reshuffle. --Tone 10:20, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support now the blurb has been changed to "is elected" seems fine to run now. Agree with Tone that we should make it clearer that this wasn't an election that caused this. Joseph2302 (talk) 11:01, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support Her article looks great, is ITNR and altblurb, although somewhat long, it's the most complete and clear of all. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 11:31, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Posting. --Tone 11:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Would suggest that we use the image of Andersson at the front page.BabbaQ (talk) 11:49, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Agree with this, we usually use the image for the newest blurb. Joseph2302 (talk) 14:32, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Post-posting support This is historic. -TenorTwelve (talk) 14:30, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Since Sweden's in the EU, perhaps she'll become the next Merkel. – Sca (talk) 15:25, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Then again, maybe not. – Sca (talk) 20:01, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Update by the nominator Things are looking bad for her and her party now. The Center Party (liberal) voted for the opposition’s budget and it got through. The Center party did not agree with the goverment’s budget, stating it was way too left. That would mean Magdallena now has to rule with right wing economic politics, which she accepted. However their junior party the Green party did not accept it and have left the goverment meaning a new Riksdag election for the prime minister post shall be held. Interesting development. SVT BastianMAT (talk) 16:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Update 2 by nominator Magdallena Andersson has officially resigned. We might have to pull the news back as she won’t be assuming office. She will only assume office if she wins a new prime minister vote, which might take place in a few days/weeks, depending on how the talks with the speaker goes. SVT BastianMAT (talk) 16:46, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Pull (or update the blurb). Her resignation is quickly making international news. 142.182.136.105 (talk) 17:38, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Update blurb Move over Kim Campbell, there's a new sheriff in town. Or more precisely, there was one for a few hours.Scaramouche33 (talk) 17:58, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Pull until it's confirmed whether she will now be the leader or not. Joseph2302 (talk) 18:01, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose pull What is ITNR is that a few hours ago she has been elected by the Swedish parliament. However much she has resigned. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 18:20, 24 November 2021 (UTC) What updating with "and immediately resigns" or something? This is a really weird sequence of events. --Tone 18:21, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Pull - The blurb, as it currently stands, is false.--WaltCip-(talk) 18:50, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Updated to Magdalena Andersson (pictured), shortly after being elected as the first female prime minister of Sweden, resigns. Any further changes, please? --PFHLai (talk) 19:13, 24 November 2021 (UTC) I think this is fine now. --Tone 19:25, 24 November 2021 (UTC) I'm not a big fan of blurbs that contemplate the resignation of a prime minister...But knowing a bit of precedent, it's very likely that in a few days/weeks she will be re-elected, as happened with Löfven in the middle of this year. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 19:48, 24 November 2021 (UTC) For the record, I support this new blurb. It will work until she is finally elected the new PM in a few days or at the longest a week.BabbaQ (talk) 20:21, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks. Hopefully, we'll have an update about her taking office soon. That would be a simple update to do. --PFHLai (talk) 20:31, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Pull -- wait until she actually is seated. She just resigned. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 21:22, 24 November 2021 (UTC) The blurb already says that. It's fine. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 21:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) It's probably just my own bias here; but it seems silly to post this when she just resigned. Forming coalition governments in a parliamentary system is weird. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 21:45, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART)[edit] Article: Double Asteroid Redirection Test (talk · history · tag) Blurb: ?NASA launches DART – the first attempt to change the course of an asteroid (pictured) (Post) Alternative blurb: ?The Double Asteroid Redirection Test spacecraft is launched on a mission to the asteroid Didymos and its moon Dimorphos (artist's impression pictured) Alternative blurb II: ?The Double Asteroid Redirection Test spacecraft is launched on a mission to attempt to deflect the course of the asteroid Dimorphos (artist's impression pictured) News source(s): BBC, Guardian, NYT Credits: Nominated by Andrew Davidson (talk · give credit) Created by Frmorrison (talk · give credit) Updated by CRS-20 (talk · give credit) Article updated Nominator's comments: There's going to be a follow-up launching in 2024 and arriving in 2027 so it's quite a long-term plan. But it's in the news now. Andrew?(talk) 08:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support important mission with global implications, good article. Polyamorph (talk) 08:18, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment. This may be notable as the first mission of its type (to post now); it will be ITNR when it arrives as well. Just saying. 331dot (talk) 08:19, 24 November 2021 (UTC) This may be ITN/R per "first ... launches of any type of rocket" as it's the first mission to use the NEXT drive but that's debatable. Andrew?(talk) 10:09, 24 November 2021 (UTC) The NEXT is the thruster on the spacecraft, not the rocket that put it up there(a Falcon 9). 331dot (talk) 12:31, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Such missions usually have multiple stages and each stage has separate rocket engines. The first stage is usually more spectacular but there's no scientific reason to prefer it. For deep space missions lasting years, the efficiency of the final spacecraft will be most important and this is a new design. Andrew?(talk) 12:54, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support important global mission (even if it does sound like DART is copying the plot of Salvation (TV series)). Added 3 cn tags to article, but apart from that, it looks more than good enough article quality for the front page. Joseph2302 (talk) 09:13, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support Everyone in the world should be happy we'll finally have a way to stop any doomsday asteroids from wiping us all out. Dream Focus 11:15, 24 November 2021 (UTC) If it works, of course... _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 11:39, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support is ITNR from what Andrew says and the global impact of this mission is undoubted, so it's clearly notable. In fact I think it should be one of the most important scientific news of the year. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 11:39, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Global impact?? I thought the idea was to avoid that! Martinevans123 (talk) 13:52, 24 November 2021 (UTC) This event can't be notable, its only impact is on a small unpopulated asteroid! WaltCip-(talk) 14:17, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Impactfulness nonapparent at this pt. in time & space. – Sca (talk) 15:00, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment the proposed blurb is a mess. I've added alt1, though for some reason that's messing up the template formatting - I can't work out why. Modest Genius talk 13:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Also, this is not ITNR, as it's not a new type of rocket and interplanetary probes are ITNR when they arrive at their destination, not when launched. But the gap here is long enough (ten months) that it's reasonable to post both launch and arrival. Modest Genius talk 13:15, 24 November 2021 (UTC) @Modest Genius: I fixed the formatting issue. Adding italics to either of the blurbs breaks it, because italics are already applied by default.--WaltCip-(talk) 13:26, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks. Modest Genius talk 13:44, 24 November 2021 (UTC) The fact that the mission is attempting to alter the course of the asteroid makes this particularly notable. Added alt2. Polyamorph (talk) 13:40, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Alt2 is incorrect. It won't 'deflect the course' of the asteroid. The impact will modify orbit of the moon around the asteroid, not either of their orbits around the Sun. Modest Genius talk 13:44, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Dimorphos is an asteroid (albeit a minor one compared to Didymos). It will deflect its course. Nothing to do with the Sun. Polyamorph (talk) 13:46, 24 November 2021 (UTC) It may deflect its course. – Sca (talk) 15:06, 24 November 2021 (UTC) It will deflect it, even if by only a negligible amount. But this is covered by the wording of alt2 "on a mission to attempt to deflect the course". Polyamorph (talk) 15:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – From what I've seen, this is such a complicated, long-term project that any significant results may be years off. – Sca (talk) 13:30, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose - no mention of Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck or Michael Bay. But seriously Support, though I'd recommend that gallery be trimmed down. --Masem (t) 15:03, 24 November 2021 (UTC) You forgot to mention Taylor Swift. – Sca (talk) 15:07, 24 November 2021 (UTC) @Sca: You mean Liv Tyler :) Brandmeistertalk 20:05, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support ALT2 Very significant, and definitely should be in ITN.

The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 10:35, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Over a million people die on the roads every year – that's over 3,000 every day.

Joseph2302 (talk) 08:35, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Not terrorism, according to "sources", so whilst tragic, it appears to be a worse-than-usual crime gone wrong. Black Kite (talk) 08:44, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support -- It seems that around five people died in the attack. The perpetrator has been reported by a few media outlets as Daniel Brooks, a black man who raps under the name "MathboiFly" and has tons of social media posts supporting BLM, and this was in the aftermath of a very notable event where Rittenhouse was cleared as killing two black men in self-defence. OldPeace7068 (talk) 09:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Complete extrapolation. Police have said they believe he was on the run having committed a separate crime, nothing to do with Rittenhouse at all. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 09:35, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Wikipedia is there to report the facts. Police and many members of the public initially considered the possibility of Islamic terrorism due to similar incidents in the past involving Muslims, the targeting of a western festival, and the recent rise in Islamic terrorist activity, but police have now confirmed that this is not terrorism related. Similarly, there have been widespread links/controversy made between the rapper and his connections to BLM, and it has been linked to Rittenhouse whether you like it or not. It is part of the story. The killer is a major supporter and activist of BLM. And this happened in the aftermath of Rittenhouse's acquittal. It's all part of the background and developing story. OldPeace7068 (talk) 09:45, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Not at all. The police have stated he was fleeing a separate scene. Conflating this with BLM/Rittenhouse is pure crystal balling. Thanks. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 09:47, 22 November 2021 (UTC) "two black men" and you'd think we were on a website about facts... CharredWaffle (talk) 14:04, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. Calling this an "attack" may be a misnomer as it appears that the suspect was fleeing the police, not that it was a preplanned attack or terrorism. 331dot (talk) 12:50, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Maybe so. OTOH, at least one report quotes a witness as saying the vehicle seemed to be "targeting people" as it veered from side to side. Also, reports say it crashed through barriers to reach the parade, which seems to indicate that it was indeed an attack, though possibly not a pre-planned one. – Sca (talk) 16:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment The blurb should (and currently does not) mention the country in which this event took place. Chrisclear (talk) 12:56, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose - It's not at all clear that this is an act of terrorism, and thus not something that would be imminently notable.--WaltCip-(talk) 13:09, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose both on merit and article quality. As of this comment, the incident does not appear to have been a deliberate attack. I would be open to reconsideration if contrary information comes to light. Also, at present the article is little more than an oversized stub. It's not ready for the main page. -Ad Orientem (talk) 13:13, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support ... pending expansion of article, which presently comprises a mere 250 words, i.e. a stub.

ArsenalGhanaPartey (talk) 15:31, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment If the incident turns out not to be terrorist motivated, I honestly don't see it in Main Page, and if it's , with five dead, I 'mnot very clear, although the number of injured is dantesque. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 15:51, 22 November 2021 (UTC) If this is confirmed as an unfortunate series of events with no purposeful motivating factor (driver escaping from knife fight and inadvertently ran through parade crowd), then I would agree this is not really something that should be posted. This doesn't mean motiveless events can't ever be posted but I would expect the results to be more devasting (like the various major building fires or collapses that we had). --Masem (t) 16:36, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Exactly, I think the same Masem. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 17:30, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Wait – As an AP update seems to suggest this was the act of a lone nutcase with a record, I've withdrawn my provisonal support. However, it seems we're still in a wait situation, since nine of the injured are listed in critical condition. If the toll were to rise to double digits, we might still want to consider a blurb about this very nasty event. – Sca (talk) 18:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support if the motivation turns out to be terrorism, neutral if otherwise. Mlb96 (talk) 19:04, 22 November 2021 (UTC) A post – by an IT user with no other contributions – on our article's talk page posits racial motivation.

The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 19:11, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Please see expanded comment above. Thanks. – Sca (talk) 19:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support. This event is in the news and the article looks to be in good shape. -- Tavix (talk) 19:38, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: – Since perp's been ID'd & police say he'll face five counts of first-degree intentional homicide, this is looking potentially more significant. – Sca (talk) 20:02, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Per The Independent this guy had a domestic dispute, and drove his car like a lunatic. Not terror-related, just an idiot behind the wheel. Not significant, tragic, but will never make the top 1000 things that happened on Planet Earth in 2021, let alone the top 250. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support - a mass-casualty event, receiving international coverage (e.g., BBC), a suspect is being charged, and the article has been improved to sufficient quality. Levivich 20:04, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support - rare (even in the US) mass-casualty event. Article quality is decent. Destroyeraa (Alternate account) 20:28, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment a road traffic accident in the US is not rare. Mass-casualty events in the US are far from rare. It's pretty obvious that giving this tragic yet non-terrorist/non-BLM/non-protest/non-deliberate accident undue prominence is not what the encyclopedia was designed to do. Of course, you can dig into the BBC website and find coverage, it's all "shock and think of the children" in the US, but the rest of the world has moved on the moment it was clear it was a sad instance of a crime somewhere else having shitty side-effects, and literally nothing more. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) The last time I remember a similar incident happened in the US was late 2017 when somebody plowed into a crowd in Virginia after a violent demonstration got broken up. We posted the event that it was tangentially related to, largely on the strength of somebody plowing their car into a crowd and killing someone. You supported posting it. Rockphed (talk) 01:03, 23 November 2021 (UTC) If you're referring to Charlottesville car attack, that was about a man deliberately setting out to ram people. This is about a man trying to escape the scene of a domestic incident and getting into a road traffic accident. The two are incomparable. But good try. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 08:07, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Agreeing with previous posters, posting this event would seem to be giving undue weight to a tragic traffic accident. Comparison with the Charlottesville incident from several years back is unfair, given the explicitly political motivations of the earlier event. Wizardoftheyear (talk) 01:17, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Neutral and Wait Yes, with the additional details that have come to light, this is literally a domestic issue that had decidedly more tragic consequences. However, that is additional details. The initial response, and the fact there were several fatalities during a celebration, caught on camera and shared around the world before anyone knew what was going on, has made this major news and a source of intrigue. I think we need to wait to see if the news stations drop their coverage now that there is less intrigue and crisis; if it has effectively left the news cycle by end of day, take this as an oppose, but if it is still on the news banners, take this as support. Kingsif (talk) 01:42, 23 November 2021 (UTC) 4 of the 12 paragraphs in this article start "On November 2X". Typical anti-American bias from the Brits (which is far from rare) notwithstanding, the quality is not there yet. GreatCaesarsGhost 02:23, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Support - Tragic, criminally-induced mass-casualty. Significant details are now known.

This at first got attention because it might have been terrorism related, no problem there. But all we are left with now is an accident which leaves 5 death: while tragic, this is sadly an everyday occurrence. We have e.g. this week a ferry accident in Sri Lanka (at least 6 death)[5], 7 death in Greece when migrants flee the police[6], 22 deaths on Lake Kivu[7], nine deaths in a fire in Bulgaria[8], 10 deaths in China after a car crash[9], ... I see no reason to post this, as it is not exceptional, has no lasting importance, and isn't even very interesting (without the terrorism angle). It's a sad tragedy, but a very common one. Fram (talk) 17:03, 23 November 2021 (UTC) I think it is WP:TOOSOON to make a determination as to whether this was an act of terror or not. Terrorism or not, the ramming appears to be deliberate, and it has made national and international headlines. Aasim (talk) 06:53, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose.

Major election in an EU member state. – Illegitimate Barrister (talk • contribs), 02:46, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Question Do we post presidential elections even if the president has mostly symbolic roles? Scaramouche33 (talk) 07:32, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, heads of state elections are posted even if they are ceremonial/wield little power, it mostly depends on the article quality itself which should be more than sufficient. Two examples are the Italian presidental election and Czech presidental election, both having similar powers to the Bulgarian one. [10] [11] BastianMAT (talk) 09:02, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Weak support this article has been on front page for a week already, but I guess the second round presidency vote means that it's ITN eligible again. Article looks to have been sufficiently updated about the presidential second round vote. Joseph2302 (talk) 12:10, 22 November 2021 (UTC) This is not ITNR. We no longer post all elections for head of state- we post the election/choosing of the official with actual executive power, according to List of current heads of state and government; in Bulgaria that is the PM, not the president. 331dot (talk) 12:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) In which case, I oppose this nomination, and it shouldn't have been tagged as ITNR. Joseph2302 (talk) 12:37, 22 November 2021 (UTC) In fairness, it is a recent change that not everyone may be aware of. 331dot (talk) 12:41, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Alright, I thought going by older posts that head of state elections are still part of ITNR but if its been removed, no problem and thanks for the headsup for future nominations. BastianMAT (talk) 12:46, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I just saw this now. I must have missed the change or forgot about it. So my comment on other presidents is not relevant here. --Tone 17:49, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Exactly, that’s what got me confused to when I ITNR nominated this. In the past as you and I mentioned, similar head of state elections (with similar powers) such as Moldova(November 2020), Germany, Austria, Italy, Czech Republic have been posted. 331dot said the removal of ceremonial head of state elections from ITNR were ’recently’ done, so the change must have not been too long ago for us to not know that.BastianMAT (talk) 18:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Blurb on MainPage was updated and moved up --PFHLai (talk) 13:11, 22 November 2021 (UTC) PFHLai there wasn't consensus to do this update- the presidential election is not ITNR, and there was not consensus here that it's important enough for ITN. We should leave it where it is, so it can roll off soon, instead of moving it up so it'll stay on ITN for another week... Joseph2302 (talk) 13:27, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Post posting support If the election was stand-alone, we would probably post it. This is just the case where the general election were held together with the first round of presidential, so there is a single article. I don't see a problem. --Tone 14:56, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I doubt we would post this as a standalone item. He may be head of state, but he has no power. It's the Prime Minister of Bulgaria who would be posted automatically.  — Amakuru (talk) 17:18, 22 November 2021 (UTC) In fact he has been in de facto power since the 2021 April elections as he appointed his friend as acting prime minister. The de jure power he wields is similar to those in Italy and Czech Republic, where he gets to nominate the prime minister and supreme court judges, he can veto laws (although parliament can override) and he of course serves as head of state, don’t forget Bulgaria even has a vice president. In the past we have posted the Italian presidental and Czech Republic presidental elections, both are parliamantary republics too. I thought it was ITNR, but 331dot mentioned that head of state elections (where the head of state is not head of goverment) was recently removed from ITNR. Italian presidental election posted Czech Republic presidental election posted BastianMAT (talk) 17:32, 22 November 2021 (UTC) (ec) As far as I remember we post both if the articles are ok. We've posted presidents of Austria and Germany, which have a similar role, for example. Furthermore, the president of Germany is elected by Bundestag, not by a popular vote. --Tone 17:36, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Pull update and Revert back to previous version per Joseph2302. This guy is just a figure head, and we already posted the main election result. There was no reason to have bumped this up, and the result is not ITN/R so needs consensus, which it doesn't have.  — Amakuru (talk) 17:14, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Pull update and agree with above, not seeing consensus here for this to have even been posted in the first instance. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 17:21, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Beyond the issue of whether it should be on the main page, the blurb is clumsy. "In Bulgaria," is redundant. Where else but in Bulgaria would you be elected President of Bulgaria? Schwede66 17:57, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Restored old blurb. --PFHLai (talk) 18:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose pull Not a head of state change but in the same spirit This post was made by orbitalbuzzsaw gang (talk) 19:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment I think we need some kind of page break to restart voting. A lot of the opposition above was to the unilateral action and not the nom itself. as for me, Oppose while there are some states with significant power invested in the secondary office, this is not one of them. GreatCaesarsGhost 21:55, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I didn't particularly mind about the unilateral action myself - it was made in good faith - and my oppose is purely on the merits of the case, for much the same reasons as you.

The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 23:23, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Not that it matters to this nomination, but Rittenhouse's victims were white. GreatCaesarsGhost 00:04, 20 November 2021 (UTC) *cough cough* Rittenhouse's victims were white *cough cough* – John M Wolfson (talk • contribs) 00:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Who said he wasn't talking about Young Dolph's routine assassin? We don't know he wasn't white. We don't know if he had other black American victims. Memphis is all about unsolved mysteries! AGF. InedibleHulk (talk) 02:06, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose on quality The article needs a lot of work, as there are multiple sections with no inline citations.Pawnkingthree (talk) 23:42, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support While this might be unduly implicative of the Chinese state being connected, if RSs are making that connection this definitely belongs. – John M Wolfson (talk • contribs) 00:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose on quality I would support this if the article has some ref work done. There's sections that are unsourced. --TDKR Chicago 101 (talk) 00:34, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose this is newsworthy for sure but blurbing that someone "disappeared" after making an accusation seems like a WP:BLPCRIME issue to me. --LaserLegs (talk) 00:39, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Completely agree it's an awkward thing to summarise in a way that fits BLP while keeping it clear why the event is notable, I'd welcome suggestions for alternative phrasing. I realise this is a fairly limited action, but for that reason I deliberately didn't link to the person she accused in the proposed blurb. Blythwood (talk) 01:57, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose as per LaserLegs, there's something wrong about posting speculation that someone disappeared straight after they made accusations. With little reliable information, this seems like a BLP issue to post it. Joseph2302 (talk) 01:47, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Far too speculative, with overtones of anti-China sentiment, and with too many unknowns. Needs far more clarification before it is posted. And a guarantee that ITN will publish a full We Were Wrong! statement and retraction on the Main page when it is found out she has just eloped with her boyfriend or girlfriend, as the case may be. HiLo48 (talk) 01:55, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Clearly if China "disappeared" her, that would be a story, but this appears to be Western nations making a demand of China and there's no hard evidence she has been killed or imprisoned or the like. We don't post this type of speculative stories. --Masem (t) 02:16, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support Per wide coverage in RSes. Normchou?? 03:22, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose unless the incident has a separate article. Sun8908?Talk 07:38, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support — article looks decent enough for ITN standards by my eye, wide coverage in RSes. If the choice of "disappears" is undesirable, then "is reported missing" might be a potential alternative (posted as altblurb). [osunpokeh/talk/contributions] 08:41, 20 November 2021 (UTC) I think that suggests she was reported missing in the police report sense, not that Novak Djokovic described her as "a missing person" to reporters. Not a bad idea. Just a bit ambiguous. InedibleHulk (talk) 09:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Strong support, in the news, top page news in many countries. The issue is she has suddenly disappeared after accusing a senior cabinet minister of a serious crime, and the involved parties are public figures indept of this incident, so there is nothing wrong as long as it is sourced and not stated as truth. Peng's disappearance and the resulting sports diplomacy pressure and boycott threats are sufficient Bumbubookworm (talk) 12:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Have you ever studied the difference between correlation and causation? HiLo48 (talk) 21:48, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Yes I have and I wonder if it's possible to have a maths competition over Wikipedia lol. I never said there was a causation, although I am sure many on Wikipedia have noted your hard-left POV eg trying to get all right of centre Australian newspapers struck off at RSN. Bumbubookworm (talk) 22:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Applause.

Something that may have happened isn't blurbworthy, no matter how widely it's hyped. – Sca (talk) 13:05, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose per Masem, Sca.

Polyamorph (talk) 20:03, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support per above. The article has unref'd sections about her tennis career, but the linked section is ready. Davey2116 (talk) 21:52, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. We shouldn't (and don't) post articles with multiple unsourced sections. The fact that the section linked in bold is referenced is irrelevant. Black Kite (talk) 23:26, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Wait Let's wait until we are 100% sure what has happened to her. Heythereimaguy (talk) 23:53, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Global Times continues to point to her, this time at a restaurant with a coach and friends, seemingly quite visible. Western speculation now turns to whether she's safe, though, or free from external interference or to be believed. All very personal and hard-to-answer questions, for anybody anywhere. InedibleHulk (talk) 00:10, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose it's just one person in a world where much worse things happen in other places like Ethiopia. Banedon (talk) 01:11, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose for now. Videos of Peng Shuai have supposedly surfaced. Nice4What (talk · contribs) – (Thanks ?) 03:30, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Support However, I propose removing the term 'Chinese' in front of Peng Shuai. It does not add to her character or her identity as a professional tennis player. Something along the lines of "Professional tennis player Peng Shuai disappears after accusing former Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli of sexual assault." would be better imo. However, we should also note the videos posted by Global Times editors (primarily those tweeted by editor-in-chief Hu Xijin) and their aftermath. JMonkey2006 (talk) 11:10, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – She's reappeared, online at least. End of story? – Sca (talk) 13:34, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Strong support Wide coverage by RSes and notable. Fakescientist8000 (talk) 14:05, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Still too murky and speculative, with little general impact. – Sca (talk) 15:24, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Leaving aside anything else, there is video evidence of her out and about so she hasn't been "disappeared" and isn't "missing". Whether or not something else is happening is in the realm of speculation, and would require a separate blurb. Also, very large swathes of the article on her career lack even a single citation.

This applies to a high percentage of the content we post and is unproductive." "International notability" is not a criteria for posting at ITN, nor has it ever been. --Jayron32 19:05, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Well my direct opinion is that it is not notable. My reasoning is the discussion that already took place on the 2021 talk page. I also have previous discussions months ago where things highly notable to one country aren’t included. Elijahandskip (talk) 19:11, 19 November 2021 (UTC) This is not a discussion of the page 2021. The criteria established for other parts of Wikipedia don't apply here. If you wish to change the criteria used for the ITN box, then start a discussion at WT:ITN. Votes without valid rationales are given little weight. It's fine if you have a useful rationale, but merely "I don't think it's notable enough" does not provide any useful guidance to admins when deciding consensus. I mean, you're allowed to say any silly thing you want, I suppose, but you can't expect anyone to take you seriously if it isn't valid. --Jayron32 19:18, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Well since you don’t like my reasoning, just let me say “no”. People have supported ITN’s in the past without giving a reason, so my “Oppose” in this case will not have a reason. Elijahandskip (talk) 19:22, 19 November 2021 (UTC) As I said, it's a free world. People do nonsensical things all of the time. --Jayron32 19:24, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Yep, I couldn’t agree more. In reality, my oppose on this comes more to combat American Wikipedia vs English Wikipedia. There is a essay on Wikipedia that I recently read that has that meaning. Not everything that happens in America is notable for Wikipedia/2021/ITN/Portal Current Events, etc….Elijahandskip (talk) 19:34, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose (at least on news of just the verdict). It was a highly watched case in the U.S., but it was clear early on to many legal experts that are crying foul on judicial behavior. It is very very likely to see an appeal and so this is not the end. This is not like the result from the very public George Floyd protests (which we posted and had ongoing about those, and the verdict). That said, there had been concerns there may be rioting following an acquittal , and while I'm not seeing any immediate news on that, a major riot (akin to the LA riots after King's verdict) would likely be the newsworthy factor here. --Masem (t) 19:05, 19 November 2021 (UTC) There literally cannot be any appeal of a not guilty verdict. This is a core principle of how double jeopardy is handled in American jurisprudence. A not guilty jury verdict is basically always final. See [12]. There are some exceedingly rare exceptions to this, but none of them would apply in this case. An ordinary jury verdict of "not guilty" like this one (even in a controversial trial) is treated as basically sacrosanct, and there can be no appeals by the government. --Jayron32 19:08, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Except for the calls for a mistrial that are being entered now. I know there's complexities with double jeopardy there, but that's still on the books and that itself can be a legal process. --Masem (t) 19:15, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Um, what? There were calls for a mistrial by Rittenhouse's defense team prior to the jury verdict coming back. Now that the verdict is in their client's favor, I doubt highly they will press forward with these requests. Indeed, articles such as this one note "The verdict also meant that Judge Bruce Schroeder did not have to rule on the defense's motions for a mistrial." --Jayron32 19:23, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose as above. If we had to have an American court psychodrama today, the better option from a world-historical perspective would probably be the acquittal of the purported killers of Malcolm X. —Brigade Piron (talk) 19:20, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose AGF, but this is such a small story in the grand scheme. GreatCaesarsGhost 19:23, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Wait. It is too early to tell what impact this will have. It could be a Rodney King-like result where acquittal of the accused leads to broad social unrest, or it could pass with a shrug. I expect that we will know within 24 hours.

I wonder if we should put this blurb up now, or when Parliament repeals them and the farmers go home (don't have strong opinions either way, but I lean towards waiting). If we're going to put it up now, I've uploaded this screengrab of Modi's announcement from his CC-BY YouTube channel; we could use it. Btw Indefensible - Dracophyllum was the only updater, not DiplomatTesterMan. Kind regards, W. Tell DCCXLVI (talk to me!/c) 07:05, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Using the update to put back in ongoing instead of a final blurb would be fine too if preferable. And DiplomatTesterMan did more updates on the article before that, he still deserves some credit too I think. - Indefensible (talk) 07:12, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose because the article is not sufficiently updated. There is currently a 1 sentence mention in the lead of the repeal of the laws, and no mention of it, nor of any follow-on protests, anywhere in the body of the article. Before this can be posted, the latest developments would need to be added to the article appropriately. --Jayron32 12:18, 19 November 2021 (UTC) @Jayron32 Have you read the repeal section? Dracophyllum 20:10, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Your response is 8 hours after Jayron32's, Dracophyllum. The section may have not existed when Jayron commented. But then again, I am not going to take the time to check if it did exist at 12:18 PM UTC on 19 Nov 2021. Tube·of·Light 02:30, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: The announcement by itself has no legal value. Parliament has to repeal the laws, which it will probably do in the coming Winter Session. Also some farmer's unions are continuing protests until the laws are repealed and minimum support prices reconsidered. So it might be better to wait, but no strong opinion either way. --Jose Mathew (talk) 12:24, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Wait and see what the impact of this is.

In fact, we do post many India-centric stories here, this one having festered in ongoing for nearly a year. --LaserLegs (talk) 23:36, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support. Invariably it is announcements that get more attention than the actual act, most of the time(we post elections when the result is known, not when the results are official/certified). If Modi renegs, that will likely be newsworthy itself. 331dot (talk) 23:16, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Weak oppose - as Wilhelm Tell DCCXLVI says, the BKU is still protesting. I would prefer waiting till the laws are actually repealed (and FWIW, these laws are being repealed just before the 2022 Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly elections and elections in some other states, which are crucial for Modi's political party). Tube·of·Light 02:30, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – On article quality – and as others have noted because the laws haven't taken effect.

And of course, there will be no "permanent cancellation of The Boat Race", that's total bollocks, but perhaps inline with your regular contributions. As you perhaps should know already, The Boat Race 2022 is scheduled for next year, and if COVID stymies it, one imagines it will simply be moved to the River Great Ouse once again. I'm unclear as to where you think that a lunar eclipse would be a portent for the permanent cancellation of an event which has been conducted since 1829, even before the Third Reich failed to play nicely. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 17:56, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Ease up, Ramblo, it was a joke. (And BTW, the Third Reich and this topic are entirely unrelated.) – Sca (talk) 18:26, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Yeah, and this topic and the Boat Race are completely unrelated. And it wasn't funny in any sense. So explain yourself. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 18:45, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support, this lunar eclipse has gotten significant news coverage.

The assassination itself, of course, would have been ITN-worthy, as would the convictions of the accused. To me, this is on the same level. BD2412 T 21:30, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Just remembered it won't make DYK as much of the content was copy/pasted from the main article, and it's not 5x from that. ITN it is! – Muboshgu (talk) 21:36, 17 November 2021 (UTC) It was also created nine months ago so any expansion at that time is far too old; you could conceivably get it through DYK if it passes as a Good Article though. ??????? ? 21:43, 17 November 2021 (UTC) It was just moved to mainspace. – Muboshgu (talk) 23:34, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Not only would this by DYK material, it's not even eligible per Muboshgu.

The two who are being exonerated are not independently notable and were released decades ago, so the actual impact is minimal.

The history books are not often changed in such a manner. 331dot (talk) 14:35, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Those two examples were incomparably more significant, as both victims were heads of state. – Sca (talk) 15:24, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Malcolm X was not a head of state but he was highly influential in the cause of civil rights. The point is that history is not often corrected as it was here. 331dot (talk) 16:53, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – per Modest Genius.

Joseph2302 (talk) 20:40, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: Perhaps the blurb can mention the evacuation of thousands of residents and the destruction of infrastructure. Power outage and a small death toll won't cut it. --PFHLai (talk) 22:35, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Comment - this is quite a significant event in Canada, with reports that it could become the most expensive natural disaster in Canadian history [16], the death toll is expected to rise, along with wide ranging effects on supply chains and transportation networks. If I recall correctly, I think we did post the 2013 Alberta floods, for precedent. Connormah (talk) 22:39, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I guess "could be" is key here. If it does become the most expensive natural disaster after electing Trudeau in the history of Canada, then it's well placed for a blurb. Maybe now is premature. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:42, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Wait Living through this, it's a pretty devastating disaster, with all road access cut off to and from the Port of Vancouver, which is having a major impact on supply chains across Western Canada. But I don't think this meets the standard previously set for ITN just yet, although there are reports that the death toll is expected to rise. There's also reports of an imminent dike breach into a large city. As such, I'd suggest that we wait. NorthernFalcon (talk) 22:51, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – Lots of damage & dislocation but so far only one fatal. – Sca (talk) 23:29, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Wait If this gets worse and deadlier, then I will support. Heythereimaguy (talk) 13:02, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Wait per NorthernFalcon & Sca. Modest Genius talk 13:16, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Comment I would further comment that given Port of Vancouver is affected (the fourth largest port in North America by volume of goods) the supply chain issues are pretty notable. [17] CaffeinAddict (talk) 23:11, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, just “affected” the fourth in North America. Not America. Not even in the world. Let's not overestimate it. Storms are storms, and it happen...a lot of things. International impact is very low. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 01:52, 21 November 2021 (UTC) The discussion above is closed. Please do not modify it.

Please read the guidelines. Admin instructions are here. ??Skip to suggestions In the news toolbox Error reports Nominations (Archives) Discussion General criteria Death criteria Recurring items Admin guide Image protection Current events portal v t e Shortcut WP:ITN/C This page provides a forum for editors to suggest items for inclusion on In the news (ITN), a protected template on the Main Page, as well as the forum for discussion of candidates. This is not the page to report errors in the ITN section on the Main Page—please go to the appropriate section at WP:ERRORS. Archives of past nominations can be found here. This candidates page is integrated with the daily pages of Portal:Current events. Under each daily section header below is the transcluded Portal:Current events items for that day (with a light green header). Each day's portal page is followed by a subsection for suggestions and discussion. A blurb is a one sentence summary of the news story. An alternate suggestion for the blurb is called an altblurb, and any more suggestions get labelled alt1, alt2, etc. A blurb needs at least one target article, highlighted in bold; reviewers check the quality of that article and whether it is updated, and whether reliable sources demonstrate the significance of the event. Other articles can also be linked. The Ongoing line is for regularly updated articles which cover events that remain in the news over a longer period of time. RD stands for the "recent deaths" line, and can include any living thing whose death was recently announced. In some cases, recent deaths may need additional explanation as provided by a blurb; this is decided by consensus.

Find the correct section below for the date of the event (not the date nominated). Do not add sections for new dates. These are automatically generated (at midnight UTC) by a bot; creating them manually breaks this process. Nominate the blurb for ITN inclusion under the "Suggestions" subheading for the date, emboldening the link in the blurb to the updated article. Use a level 4 header (====) when doing so. Preferably use the template {{ITN candidate}} to nominate the article related to the event in the news. Make sure that you include a reference from a verifiable, reliable secondary source. Press releases are not acceptable. The suggested blurb should be written in simple present tense. Adding an explanation why the event should be posted greatly increases the odds of posting. Please consider alerting editors to the nomination by adding the template {{ITN note}} to the corresponding article's talk page. Purge this page to update the cache There are criteria which guide the decision on whether or not to put a particular item on In the news, based largely on the extensiveness of the updated content and the perceived significance of the recent developments. These are listed at WP:ITN. Submissions that do not follow the guidelines at Wikipedia:In the news will not be placed onto the live template. Headers[edit] Items that have been posted or pulled from the main page are generally marked with (Posted) or (Pulled) in the item's subject so it is clear they are no longer active. Items can also be marked as (Ready) when the article is both updated and there seems to be a consensus to post. The posting admin, however, should always judge the update and the consensus to post themselves. If you find an entry that you don't feel is ready to post is marked (Ready), you should remove the mark in the header. Voicing an opinion on an item[edit] Format your comment to contain "support" or "oppose", and include a rationale for your choice. In particular, address the notability of the event, the quality of the article, and whether it has been updated. Please do not...[edit] add simple "support!" or "oppose!" votes without including your reasons. Similarly, curt replies such as "who?", "meh", or "duh!" are usually not helpful. Instead, explain the reasons why you think the item meets or does not meet the ITN inclusion criteria so a consensus can be reached. oppose an item because the event is only relating to a single country, or failing to relate to one. This applies to a high percentage of the content we post and is unproductive. accuse other editors of supporting, opposing or nominating due to a personal bias (such as ethnocentrism).

I refer to here. Yet another case with zero international impact and interest, yet another case of a purely local trial. Far from being akin to the conviction for the murder of George Floyd. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 20:46, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Alsoriano97 If "international impact" was required for postings, very little would be posted. 331dot (talk) 20:47, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, but it should be much more decisive when it comes to court rulings than in other cases (sports, science, elections...). If the follow-up of a trial has a very low international coverage/interest, will you tell me that it's not an important requirement to take into account when determining whether a court case is blurb-worthy or not? So many people are condemned every day in this world... _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 20:58, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Respectfully, we aren't talking about someone convicted of robbing the corner store, but a black man who was murdered basically for being in the wrong neighborhood in a part of the United States where convictions for this sort of thing are rare. And as I said, this incident has influenced changes in laws. 331dot (talk) 21:55, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support. This was a highly followed trial in the US, and even before the verdict this incident resulted in changes in Georgia law(the elimination of citizens' arrests). 331dot (talk) 20:52, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Article is also of decent quality from what I can see. 331dot (talk) 20:57, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support -- this verdict is likely to influence future trials of this type in the United States, and it is an historic decision in an area of the country known for its virulent racism. I doubt a jury would have reached this verdict in that area even 20 years ago. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 21:47, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support High profile case with notable legal impact, quality article. SpencerT•C 21:55, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support.

Whilst? – Sca (talk) 19:58, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose for now. Article is not developed enough to be ready for the main page. If that is fixed, it can be posted. Also, none of the blurbs link the article. That will need to be fixed. --Jayron32 20:04, 24 November 2021 (UTC) fixed now Llewee (talk) 21:01, 24 November 2021 (UTC) (Removed) Ongoing removal: 2021 Belarus–European Union border crisis[edit] Article: 2021 Belarus–European Union border crisis (talk · history · tag) Ongoing item removal (Post) Nominator's comments: The article has not has any significant updates for a week, and thus fails the ongoing criteria: In order to be posted to ongoing, the article needs to be regularly updated with new, pertinent information. If there have been significant updates in the last week, these should be added, but right now, this article fails the ongoing criteria. In particular, the last significant update is older than the day of the oldest ITN event (21 November), which is a general rule for something not being updated enough for Ongoing. Joseph2302 (talk) 12:26, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Remove. I think Belarus cleared out migrants from the border; Putin must think he made his point. 331dot (talk) 12:28, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Remove. The migrants have been moved away from the border and the situation has calmed down. No longer an ongoing event. Modest Genius talk 13:05, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – Although the situation appears to have been at least partially defused, there have been reports in recent days that in some cases Belorussian guards have continued to help migrants breach the border into Polish territory. [1], [2] [3] – Sca (talk) 13:27, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Remove the existence of news coverage that Sca notes is a necessary but not sufficient condition for maintaining an ongoing link. The article also needs to have been continuously updated. That clearly didn't happen here. --Jayron32 20:06, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – I have read the reports mentioned by Sca. It appears as if the situation have slowed down, but not ended. So still Ongoing.BabbaQ (talk) 20:23, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Removed.

(Post) Alternative blurb: ?Following the resignation of Stefan Löfven, Magdalena Andersson (pictured) is elected by the Riksdag as the first female Prime Minister of Sweden. Alternative blurb II: ?Magdalena Andersson (pictured) is elected as the first female Prime Minister of Sweden. News source(s): BBC Credits: Nominated by BastianMAT (talk · give credit) Article updated The nominated event is listed on WP:ITN/R, so each occurrence is presumed to be important enough to post. Comments should focus on whether the quality of the article and update meet WP:ITNCRIT, not the significance. Nominator's comments: ITNR, as it falls under "Changes in the holder of the office which administer the executive of their respective state/government, in those countries which qualify under the criteria above, as listed at List of current heads of state and government except when that change was already posted as part of a general election". First female prime minister of Sweden. BastianMAT (talk) 09:59, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment she takes office on the 26th (according to her article). Until that point, the blurb isn't correct, as she only becomes the first female PM of Sweden on that date. Is it usual to post when it's announced, or when they take office? Joseph2302 (talk) 10:04, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Usually when they are elected but yeah with the blurb of being elected. BastianMAT (talk) 10:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support - First female PM in Sweden. But change blurb to ”is elected” instead becomes.BabbaQ (talk) 10:06, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Yes. BastianMAT (talk) 10:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support Significant as new PM and first female. Perhaps the blub should be "elected by the Riksdag" since she didn't gain office through a normal election (by the people). cart-Talk 10:15, 24 November 2021 (UTC) That's normal in a parliamentary system. – Sca (talk) 15:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment The blurb should probably start with "Following the resignation of Stefan Löfven, ..." to provide context, since this was not an election outcome but a government reshuffle. --Tone 10:20, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support now the blurb has been changed to "is elected" seems fine to run now. Agree with Tone that we should make it clearer that this wasn't an election that caused this. Joseph2302 (talk) 11:01, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support Her article looks great, is ITNR and altblurb, although somewhat long, it's the most complete and clear of all. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 11:31, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Posting. --Tone 11:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Would suggest that we use the image of Andersson at the front page.BabbaQ (talk) 11:49, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Agree with this, we usually use the image for the newest blurb. Joseph2302 (talk) 14:32, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Post-posting support This is historic. -TenorTwelve (talk) 14:30, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Since Sweden's in the EU, perhaps she'll become the next Merkel. – Sca (talk) 15:25, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Then again, maybe not. – Sca (talk) 20:01, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Update by the nominator Things are looking bad for her and her party now. The Center Party (liberal) voted for the opposition’s budget and it got through. The Center party did not agree with the goverment’s budget, stating it was way too left. That would mean Magdallena now has to rule with right wing economic politics, which she accepted. However their junior party the Green party did not accept it and have left the goverment meaning a new Riksdag election for the prime minister post shall be held. Interesting development. SVT BastianMAT (talk) 16:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Update 2 by nominator Magdallena Andersson has officially resigned. We might have to pull the news back as she won’t be assuming office. She will only assume office if she wins a new prime minister vote, which might take place in a few days/weeks, depending on how the talks with the speaker goes. SVT BastianMAT (talk) 16:46, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Pull (or update the blurb). Her resignation is quickly making international news. 142.182.136.105 (talk) 17:38, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Update blurb Move over Kim Campbell, there's a new sheriff in town. Or more precisely, there was one for a few hours.Scaramouche33 (talk) 17:58, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Pull until it's confirmed whether she will now be the leader or not. Joseph2302 (talk) 18:01, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose pull What is ITNR is that a few hours ago she has been elected by the Swedish parliament. However much she has resigned. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 18:20, 24 November 2021 (UTC) What updating with "and immediately resigns" or something? This is a really weird sequence of events. --Tone 18:21, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Pull - The blurb, as it currently stands, is false.--WaltCip-(talk) 18:50, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Updated to Magdalena Andersson (pictured), shortly after being elected as the first female prime minister of Sweden, resigns. Any further changes, please? --PFHLai (talk) 19:13, 24 November 2021 (UTC) I think this is fine now. --Tone 19:25, 24 November 2021 (UTC) I'm not a big fan of blurbs that contemplate the resignation of a prime minister...But knowing a bit of precedent, it's very likely that in a few days/weeks she will be re-elected, as happened with Löfven in the middle of this year. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 19:48, 24 November 2021 (UTC) For the record, I support this new blurb. It will work until she is finally elected the new PM in a few days or at the longest a week.BabbaQ (talk) 20:21, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks. Hopefully, we'll have an update about her taking office soon. That would be a simple update to do. --PFHLai (talk) 20:31, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Pull -- wait until she actually is seated. She just resigned. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 21:22, 24 November 2021 (UTC) The blurb already says that. It's fine. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 21:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) It's probably just my own bias here; but it seems silly to post this when she just resigned. Forming coalition governments in a parliamentary system is weird. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 21:45, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART)[edit] Article: Double Asteroid Redirection Test (talk · history · tag) Blurb: ?NASA launches DART – the first attempt to change the course of an asteroid (pictured) (Post) Alternative blurb: ?The Double Asteroid Redirection Test spacecraft is launched on a mission to the asteroid Didymos and its moon Dimorphos (artist's impression pictured) Alternative blurb II: ?The Double Asteroid Redirection Test spacecraft is launched on a mission to attempt to deflect the course of the asteroid Dimorphos (artist's impression pictured) News source(s): BBC, Guardian, NYT Credits: Nominated by Andrew Davidson (talk · give credit) Created by Frmorrison (talk · give credit) Updated by CRS-20 (talk · give credit) Article updated Nominator's comments: There's going to be a follow-up launching in 2024 and arriving in 2027 so it's quite a long-term plan. But it's in the news now. Andrew?(talk) 08:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support important mission with global implications, good article. Polyamorph (talk) 08:18, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment. This may be notable as the first mission of its type (to post now); it will be ITNR when it arrives as well. Just saying. 331dot (talk) 08:19, 24 November 2021 (UTC) This may be ITN/R per "first ... launches of any type of rocket" as it's the first mission to use the NEXT drive but that's debatable. Andrew?(talk) 10:09, 24 November 2021 (UTC) The NEXT is the thruster on the spacecraft, not the rocket that put it up there(a Falcon 9). 331dot (talk) 12:31, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Such missions usually have multiple stages and each stage has separate rocket engines. The first stage is usually more spectacular but there's no scientific reason to prefer it. For deep space missions lasting years, the efficiency of the final spacecraft will be most important and this is a new design. Andrew?(talk) 12:54, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support important global mission (even if it does sound like DART is copying the plot of Salvation (TV series)). Added 3 cn tags to article, but apart from that, it looks more than good enough article quality for the front page. Joseph2302 (talk) 09:13, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support Everyone in the world should be happy we'll finally have a way to stop any doomsday asteroids from wiping us all out. Dream Focus 11:15, 24 November 2021 (UTC) If it works, of course... _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 11:39, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support is ITNR from what Andrew says and the global impact of this mission is undoubted, so it's clearly notable. In fact I think it should be one of the most important scientific news of the year. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 11:39, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Global impact?? I thought the idea was to avoid that! Martinevans123 (talk) 13:52, 24 November 2021 (UTC) This event can't be notable, its only impact is on a small unpopulated asteroid! WaltCip-(talk) 14:17, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Impactfulness nonapparent at this pt. in time & space. – Sca (talk) 15:00, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment the proposed blurb is a mess. I've added alt1, though for some reason that's messing up the template formatting - I can't work out why. Modest Genius talk 13:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Also, this is not ITNR, as it's not a new type of rocket and interplanetary probes are ITNR when they arrive at their destination, not when launched. But the gap here is long enough (ten months) that it's reasonable to post both launch and arrival. Modest Genius talk 13:15, 24 November 2021 (UTC) @Modest Genius: I fixed the formatting issue. Adding italics to either of the blurbs breaks it, because italics are already applied by default.--WaltCip-(talk) 13:26, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks. Modest Genius talk 13:44, 24 November 2021 (UTC) The fact that the mission is attempting to alter the course of the asteroid makes this particularly notable. Added alt2. Polyamorph (talk) 13:40, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Alt2 is incorrect. It won't 'deflect the course' of the asteroid. The impact will modify orbit of the moon around the asteroid, not either of their orbits around the Sun. Modest Genius talk 13:44, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Dimorphos is an asteroid (albeit a minor one compared to Didymos). It will deflect its course. Nothing to do with the Sun. Polyamorph (talk) 13:46, 24 November 2021 (UTC) It may deflect its course. – Sca (talk) 15:06, 24 November 2021 (UTC) It will deflect it, even if by only a negligible amount. But this is covered by the wording of alt2 "on a mission to attempt to deflect the course". Polyamorph (talk) 15:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – From what I've seen, this is such a complicated, long-term project that any significant results may be years off. – Sca (talk) 13:30, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose - no mention of Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck or Michael Bay. But seriously Support, though I'd recommend that gallery be trimmed down. --Masem (t) 15:03, 24 November 2021 (UTC) You forgot to mention Taylor Swift. – Sca (talk) 15:07, 24 November 2021 (UTC) @Sca: You mean Liv Tyler :) Brandmeistertalk 20:05, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support ALT2 Very significant, and definitely should be in ITN.

The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 10:35, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Over a million people die on the roads every year – that's over 3,000 every day.

Joseph2302 (talk) 08:35, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Not terrorism, according to "sources", so whilst tragic, it appears to be a worse-than-usual crime gone wrong. Black Kite (talk) 08:44, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support -- It seems that around five people died in the attack. The perpetrator has been reported by a few media outlets as Daniel Brooks, a black man who raps under the name "MathboiFly" and has tons of social media posts supporting BLM, and this was in the aftermath of a very notable event where Rittenhouse was cleared as killing two black men in self-defence. OldPeace7068 (talk) 09:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Complete extrapolation. Police have said they believe he was on the run having committed a separate crime, nothing to do with Rittenhouse at all. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 09:35, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Wikipedia is there to report the facts. Police and many members of the public initially considered the possibility of Islamic terrorism due to similar incidents in the past involving Muslims, the targeting of a western festival, and the recent rise in Islamic terrorist activity, but police have now confirmed that this is not terrorism related. Similarly, there have been widespread links/controversy made between the rapper and his connections to BLM, and it has been linked to Rittenhouse whether you like it or not. It is part of the story. The killer is a major supporter and activist of BLM. And this happened in the aftermath of Rittenhouse's acquittal. It's all part of the background and developing story. OldPeace7068 (talk) 09:45, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Not at all. The police have stated he was fleeing a separate scene. Conflating this with BLM/Rittenhouse is pure crystal balling. Thanks. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 09:47, 22 November 2021 (UTC) "two black men" and you'd think we were on a website about facts... CharredWaffle (talk) 14:04, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. Calling this an "attack" may be a misnomer as it appears that the suspect was fleeing the police, not that it was a preplanned attack or terrorism. 331dot (talk) 12:50, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Maybe so. OTOH, at least one report quotes a witness as saying the vehicle seemed to be "targeting people" as it veered from side to side. Also, reports say it crashed through barriers to reach the parade, which seems to indicate that it was indeed an attack, though possibly not a pre-planned one. – Sca (talk) 16:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment The blurb should (and currently does not) mention the country in which this event took place. Chrisclear (talk) 12:56, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose - It's not at all clear that this is an act of terrorism, and thus not something that would be imminently notable.--WaltCip-(talk) 13:09, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose both on merit and article quality. As of this comment, the incident does not appear to have been a deliberate attack. I would be open to reconsideration if contrary information comes to light. Also, at present the article is little more than an oversized stub. It's not ready for the main page. -Ad Orientem (talk) 13:13, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support ... pending expansion of article, which presently comprises a mere 250 words, i.e. a stub.

ArsenalGhanaPartey (talk) 15:31, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment If the incident turns out not to be terrorist motivated, I honestly don't see it in Main Page, and if it's , with five dead, I 'mnot very clear, although the number of injured is dantesque. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 15:51, 22 November 2021 (UTC) If this is confirmed as an unfortunate series of events with no purposeful motivating factor (driver escaping from knife fight and inadvertently ran through parade crowd), then I would agree this is not really something that should be posted. This doesn't mean motiveless events can't ever be posted but I would expect the results to be more devasting (like the various major building fires or collapses that we had). --Masem (t) 16:36, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Exactly, I think the same Masem. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 17:30, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Wait – As an AP update seems to suggest this was the act of a lone nutcase with a record, I've withdrawn my provisonal support. However, it seems we're still in a wait situation, since nine of the injured are listed in critical condition. If the toll were to rise to double digits, we might still want to consider a blurb about this very nasty event. – Sca (talk) 18:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support if the motivation turns out to be terrorism, neutral if otherwise. Mlb96 (talk) 19:04, 22 November 2021 (UTC) A post – by an IT user with no other contributions – on our article's talk page posits racial motivation.

The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 19:11, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Please see expanded comment above. Thanks. – Sca (talk) 19:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support. This event is in the news and the article looks to be in good shape. -- Tavix (talk) 19:38, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: – Since perp's been ID'd & police say he'll face five counts of first-degree intentional homicide, this is looking potentially more significant. – Sca (talk) 20:02, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Per The Independent this guy had a domestic dispute, and drove his car like a lunatic. Not terror-related, just an idiot behind the wheel. Not significant, tragic, but will never make the top 1000 things that happened on Planet Earth in 2021, let alone the top 250. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support - a mass-casualty event, receiving international coverage (e.g., BBC), a suspect is being charged, and the article has been improved to sufficient quality. Levivich 20:04, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support - rare (even in the US) mass-casualty event. Article quality is decent. Destroyeraa (Alternate account) 20:28, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment a road traffic accident in the US is not rare. Mass-casualty events in the US are far from rare. It's pretty obvious that giving this tragic yet non-terrorist/non-BLM/non-protest/non-deliberate accident undue prominence is not what the encyclopedia was designed to do. Of course, you can dig into the BBC website and find coverage, it's all "shock and think of the children" in the US, but the rest of the world has moved on the moment it was clear it was a sad instance of a crime somewhere else having shitty side-effects, and literally nothing more. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) The last time I remember a similar incident happened in the US was late 2017 when somebody plowed into a crowd in Virginia after a violent demonstration got broken up. We posted the event that it was tangentially related to, largely on the strength of somebody plowing their car into a crowd and killing someone. You supported posting it. Rockphed (talk) 01:03, 23 November 2021 (UTC) If you're referring to Charlottesville car attack, that was about a man deliberately setting out to ram people. This is about a man trying to escape the scene of a domestic incident and getting into a road traffic accident. The two are incomparable. But good try. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 08:07, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Agreeing with previous posters, posting this event would seem to be giving undue weight to a tragic traffic accident. Comparison with the Charlottesville incident from several years back is unfair, given the explicitly political motivations of the earlier event. Wizardoftheyear (talk) 01:17, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Neutral and Wait Yes, with the additional details that have come to light, this is literally a domestic issue that had decidedly more tragic consequences. However, that is additional details. The initial response, and the fact there were several fatalities during a celebration, caught on camera and shared around the world before anyone knew what was going on, has made this major news and a source of intrigue. I think we need to wait to see if the news stations drop their coverage now that there is less intrigue and crisis; if it has effectively left the news cycle by end of day, take this as an oppose, but if it is still on the news banners, take this as support. Kingsif (talk) 01:42, 23 November 2021 (UTC) 4 of the 12 paragraphs in this article start "On November 2X". Typical anti-American bias from the Brits (which is far from rare) notwithstanding, the quality is not there yet. GreatCaesarsGhost 02:23, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Support - Tragic, criminally-induced mass-casualty. Significant details are now known.

This at first got attention because it might have been terrorism related, no problem there. But all we are left with now is an accident which leaves 5 death: while tragic, this is sadly an everyday occurrence. We have e.g. this week a ferry accident in Sri Lanka (at least 6 death)[5], 7 death in Greece when migrants flee the police[6], 22 deaths on Lake Kivu[7], nine deaths in a fire in Bulgaria[8], 10 deaths in China after a car crash[9], ... I see no reason to post this, as it is not exceptional, has no lasting importance, and isn't even very interesting (without the terrorism angle). It's a sad tragedy, but a very common one. Fram (talk) 17:03, 23 November 2021 (UTC) I think it is WP:TOOSOON to make a determination as to whether this was an act of terror or not. Terrorism or not, the ramming appears to be deliberate, and it has made national and international headlines. Aasim (talk) 06:53, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose.

Major election in an EU member state. – Illegitimate Barrister (talk • contribs), 02:46, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Question Do we post presidential elections even if the president has mostly symbolic roles? Scaramouche33 (talk) 07:32, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, heads of state elections are posted even if they are ceremonial/wield little power, it mostly depends on the article quality itself which should be more than sufficient. Two examples are the Italian presidental election and Czech presidental election, both having similar powers to the Bulgarian one. [10] [11] BastianMAT (talk) 09:02, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Weak support this article has been on front page for a week already, but I guess the second round presidency vote means that it's ITN eligible again. Article looks to have been sufficiently updated about the presidential second round vote. Joseph2302 (talk) 12:10, 22 November 2021 (UTC) This is not ITNR. We no longer post all elections for head of state- we post the election/choosing of the official with actual executive power, according to List of current heads of state and government; in Bulgaria that is the PM, not the president. 331dot (talk) 12:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) In which case, I oppose this nomination, and it shouldn't have been tagged as ITNR. Joseph2302 (talk) 12:37, 22 November 2021 (UTC) In fairness, it is a recent change that not everyone may be aware of. 331dot (talk) 12:41, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Alright, I thought going by older posts that head of state elections are still part of ITNR but if its been removed, no problem and thanks for the headsup for future nominations. BastianMAT (talk) 12:46, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I just saw this now. I must have missed the change or forgot about it. So my comment on other presidents is not relevant here. --Tone 17:49, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Exactly, that’s what got me confused to when I ITNR nominated this. In the past as you and I mentioned, similar head of state elections (with similar powers) such as Moldova(November 2020), Germany, Austria, Italy, Czech Republic have been posted. 331dot said the removal of ceremonial head of state elections from ITNR were ’recently’ done, so the change must have not been too long ago for us to not know that.BastianMAT (talk) 18:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Blurb on MainPage was updated and moved up --PFHLai (talk) 13:11, 22 November 2021 (UTC) PFHLai there wasn't consensus to do this update- the presidential election is not ITNR, and there was not consensus here that it's important enough for ITN. We should leave it where it is, so it can roll off soon, instead of moving it up so it'll stay on ITN for another week... Joseph2302 (talk) 13:27, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Post posting support If the election was stand-alone, we would probably post it. This is just the case where the general election were held together with the first round of presidential, so there is a single article. I don't see a problem. --Tone 14:56, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I doubt we would post this as a standalone item. He may be head of state, but he has no power. It's the Prime Minister of Bulgaria who would be posted automatically.  — Amakuru (talk) 17:18, 22 November 2021 (UTC) In fact he has been in de facto power since the 2021 April elections as he appointed his friend as acting prime minister. The de jure power he wields is similar to those in Italy and Czech Republic, where he gets to nominate the prime minister and supreme court judges, he can veto laws (although parliament can override) and he of course serves as head of state, don’t forget Bulgaria even has a vice president. In the past we have posted the Italian presidental and Czech Republic presidental elections, both are parliamantary republics too. I thought it was ITNR, but 331dot mentioned that head of state elections (where the head of state is not head of goverment) was recently removed from ITNR. Italian presidental election posted Czech Republic presidental election posted BastianMAT (talk) 17:32, 22 November 2021 (UTC) (ec) As far as I remember we post both if the articles are ok. We've posted presidents of Austria and Germany, which have a similar role, for example. Furthermore, the president of Germany is elected by Bundestag, not by a popular vote. --Tone 17:36, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Pull update and Revert back to previous version per Joseph2302. This guy is just a figure head, and we already posted the main election result. There was no reason to have bumped this up, and the result is not ITN/R so needs consensus, which it doesn't have.  — Amakuru (talk) 17:14, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Pull update and agree with above, not seeing consensus here for this to have even been posted in the first instance. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 17:21, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Beyond the issue of whether it should be on the main page, the blurb is clumsy. "In Bulgaria," is redundant. Where else but in Bulgaria would you be elected President of Bulgaria? Schwede66 17:57, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Restored old blurb. --PFHLai (talk) 18:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose pull Not a head of state change but in the same spirit This post was made by orbitalbuzzsaw gang (talk) 19:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment I think we need some kind of page break to restart voting. A lot of the opposition above was to the unilateral action and not the nom itself. as for me, Oppose while there are some states with significant power invested in the secondary office, this is not one of them. GreatCaesarsGhost 21:55, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I didn't particularly mind about the unilateral action myself - it was made in good faith - and my oppose is purely on the merits of the case, for much the same reasons as you.

The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 23:23, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Not that it matters to this nomination, but Rittenhouse's victims were white. GreatCaesarsGhost 00:04, 20 November 2021 (UTC) *cough cough* Rittenhouse's victims were white *cough cough* – John M Wolfson (talk • contribs) 00:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Who said he wasn't talking about Young Dolph's routine assassin? We don't know he wasn't white. We don't know if he had other black American victims. Memphis is all about unsolved mysteries! AGF. InedibleHulk (talk) 02:06, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose on quality The article needs a lot of work, as there are multiple sections with no inline citations.Pawnkingthree (talk) 23:42, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support While this might be unduly implicative of the Chinese state being connected, if RSs are making that connection this definitely belongs. – John M Wolfson (talk • contribs) 00:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose on quality I would support this if the article has some ref work done. There's sections that are unsourced. --TDKR Chicago 101 (talk) 00:34, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose this is newsworthy for sure but blurbing that someone "disappeared" after making an accusation seems like a WP:BLPCRIME issue to me. --LaserLegs (talk) 00:39, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Completely agree it's an awkward thing to summarise in a way that fits BLP while keeping it clear why the event is notable, I'd welcome suggestions for alternative phrasing. I realise this is a fairly limited action, but for that reason I deliberately didn't link to the person she accused in the proposed blurb. Blythwood (talk) 01:57, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose as per LaserLegs, there's something wrong about posting speculation that someone disappeared straight after they made accusations. With little reliable information, this seems like a BLP issue to post it. Joseph2302 (talk) 01:47, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Far too speculative, with overtones of anti-China sentiment, and with too many unknowns. Needs far more clarification before it is posted. And a guarantee that ITN will publish a full We Were Wrong! statement and retraction on the Main page when it is found out she has just eloped with her boyfriend or girlfriend, as the case may be. HiLo48 (talk) 01:55, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Clearly if China "disappeared" her, that would be a story, but this appears to be Western nations making a demand of China and there's no hard evidence she has been killed or imprisoned or the like. We don't post this type of speculative stories. --Masem (t) 02:16, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support Per wide coverage in RSes. Normchou?? 03:22, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose unless the incident has a separate article. Sun8908?Talk 07:38, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support — article looks decent enough for ITN standards by my eye, wide coverage in RSes. If the choice of "disappears" is undesirable, then "is reported missing" might be a potential alternative (posted as altblurb). [osunpokeh/talk/contributions] 08:41, 20 November 2021 (UTC) I think that suggests she was reported missing in the police report sense, not that Novak Djokovic described her as "a missing person" to reporters. Not a bad idea. Just a bit ambiguous. InedibleHulk (talk) 09:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Strong support, in the news, top page news in many countries. The issue is she has suddenly disappeared after accusing a senior cabinet minister of a serious crime, and the involved parties are public figures indept of this incident, so there is nothing wrong as long as it is sourced and not stated as truth. Peng's disappearance and the resulting sports diplomacy pressure and boycott threats are sufficient Bumbubookworm (talk) 12:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Have you ever studied the difference between correlation and causation? HiLo48 (talk) 21:48, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Yes I have and I wonder if it's possible to have a maths competition over Wikipedia lol. I never said there was a causation, although I am sure many on Wikipedia have noted your hard-left POV eg trying to get all right of centre Australian newspapers struck off at RSN. Bumbubookworm (talk) 22:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Applause.

Something that may have happened isn't blurbworthy, no matter how widely it's hyped. – Sca (talk) 13:05, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose per Masem, Sca.

Polyamorph (talk) 20:03, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support per above. The article has unref'd sections about her tennis career, but the linked section is ready. Davey2116 (talk) 21:52, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. We shouldn't (and don't) post articles with multiple unsourced sections. The fact that the section linked in bold is referenced is irrelevant. Black Kite (talk) 23:26, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Wait Let's wait until we are 100% sure what has happened to her. Heythereimaguy (talk) 23:53, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Global Times continues to point to her, this time at a restaurant with a coach and friends, seemingly quite visible. Western speculation now turns to whether she's safe, though, or free from external interference or to be believed. All very personal and hard-to-answer questions, for anybody anywhere. InedibleHulk (talk) 00:10, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose it's just one person in a world where much worse things happen in other places like Ethiopia. Banedon (talk) 01:11, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose for now. Videos of Peng Shuai have supposedly surfaced. Nice4What (talk · contribs) – (Thanks ?) 03:30, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Support However, I propose removing the term 'Chinese' in front of Peng Shuai. It does not add to her character or her identity as a professional tennis player. Something along the lines of "Professional tennis player Peng Shuai disappears after accusing former Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli of sexual assault." would be better imo. However, we should also note the videos posted by Global Times editors (primarily those tweeted by editor-in-chief Hu Xijin) and their aftermath. JMonkey2006 (talk) 11:10, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – She's reappeared, online at least. End of story? – Sca (talk) 13:34, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Strong support Wide coverage by RSes and notable. Fakescientist8000 (talk) 14:05, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Still too murky and speculative, with little general impact. – Sca (talk) 15:24, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Leaving aside anything else, there is video evidence of her out and about so she hasn't been "disappeared" and isn't "missing". Whether or not something else is happening is in the realm of speculation, and would require a separate blurb. Also, very large swathes of the article on her career lack even a single citation.

This applies to a high percentage of the content we post and is unproductive." "International notability" is not a criteria for posting at ITN, nor has it ever been. --Jayron32 19:05, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Well my direct opinion is that it is not notable. My reasoning is the discussion that already took place on the 2021 talk page. I also have previous discussions months ago where things highly notable to one country aren’t included. Elijahandskip (talk) 19:11, 19 November 2021 (UTC) This is not a discussion of the page 2021. The criteria established for other parts of Wikipedia don't apply here. If you wish to change the criteria used for the ITN box, then start a discussion at WT:ITN. Votes without valid rationales are given little weight. It's fine if you have a useful rationale, but merely "I don't think it's notable enough" does not provide any useful guidance to admins when deciding consensus. I mean, you're allowed to say any silly thing you want, I suppose, but you can't expect anyone to take you seriously if it isn't valid. --Jayron32 19:18, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Well since you don’t like my reasoning, just let me say “no”. People have supported ITN’s in the past without giving a reason, so my “Oppose” in this case will not have a reason. Elijahandskip (talk) 19:22, 19 November 2021 (UTC) As I said, it's a free world. People do nonsensical things all of the time. --Jayron32 19:24, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Yep, I couldn’t agree more. In reality, my oppose on this comes more to combat American Wikipedia vs English Wikipedia. There is a essay on Wikipedia that I recently read that has that meaning. Not everything that happens in America is notable for Wikipedia/2021/ITN/Portal Current Events, etc….Elijahandskip (talk) 19:34, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose (at least on news of just the verdict). It was a highly watched case in the U.S., but it was clear early on to many legal experts that are crying foul on judicial behavior. It is very very likely to see an appeal and so this is not the end. This is not like the result from the very public George Floyd protests (which we posted and had ongoing about those, and the verdict). That said, there had been concerns there may be rioting following an acquittal , and while I'm not seeing any immediate news on that, a major riot (akin to the LA riots after King's verdict) would likely be the newsworthy factor here. --Masem (t) 19:05, 19 November 2021 (UTC) There literally cannot be any appeal of a not guilty verdict. This is a core principle of how double jeopardy is handled in American jurisprudence. A not guilty jury verdict is basically always final. See [12]. There are some exceedingly rare exceptions to this, but none of them would apply in this case. An ordinary jury verdict of "not guilty" like this one (even in a controversial trial) is treated as basically sacrosanct, and there can be no appeals by the government. --Jayron32 19:08, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Except for the calls for a mistrial that are being entered now. I know there's complexities with double jeopardy there, but that's still on the books and that itself can be a legal process. --Masem (t) 19:15, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Um, what? There were calls for a mistrial by Rittenhouse's defense team prior to the jury verdict coming back. Now that the verdict is in their client's favor, I doubt highly they will press forward with these requests. Indeed, articles such as this one note "The verdict also meant that Judge Bruce Schroeder did not have to rule on the defense's motions for a mistrial." --Jayron32 19:23, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose as above. If we had to have an American court psychodrama today, the better option from a world-historical perspective would probably be the acquittal of the purported killers of Malcolm X. —Brigade Piron (talk) 19:20, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose AGF, but this is such a small story in the grand scheme. GreatCaesarsGhost 19:23, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Wait. It is too early to tell what impact this will have. It could be a Rodney King-like result where acquittal of the accused leads to broad social unrest, or it could pass with a shrug. I expect that we will know within 24 hours.

I wonder if we should put this blurb up now, or when Parliament repeals them and the farmers go home (don't have strong opinions either way, but I lean towards waiting). If we're going to put it up now, I've uploaded this screengrab of Modi's announcement from his CC-BY YouTube channel; we could use it. Btw Indefensible - Dracophyllum was the only updater, not DiplomatTesterMan. Kind regards, W. Tell DCCXLVI (talk to me!/c) 07:05, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Using the update to put back in ongoing instead of a final blurb would be fine too if preferable. And DiplomatTesterMan did more updates on the article before that, he still deserves some credit too I think. - Indefensible (talk) 07:12, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose because the article is not sufficiently updated. There is currently a 1 sentence mention in the lead of the repeal of the laws, and no mention of it, nor of any follow-on protests, anywhere in the body of the article. Before this can be posted, the latest developments would need to be added to the article appropriately. --Jayron32 12:18, 19 November 2021 (UTC) @Jayron32 Have you read the repeal section? Dracophyllum 20:10, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Your response is 8 hours after Jayron32's, Dracophyllum. The section may have not existed when Jayron commented. But then again, I am not going to take the time to check if it did exist at 12:18 PM UTC on 19 Nov 2021. Tube·of·Light 02:30, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: The announcement by itself has no legal value. Parliament has to repeal the laws, which it will probably do in the coming Winter Session. Also some farmer's unions are continuing protests until the laws are repealed and minimum support prices reconsidered. So it might be better to wait, but no strong opinion either way. --Jose Mathew (talk) 12:24, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Wait and see what the impact of this is.

In fact, we do post many India-centric stories here, this one having festered in ongoing for nearly a year. --LaserLegs (talk) 23:36, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support. Invariably it is announcements that get more attention than the actual act, most of the time(we post elections when the result is known, not when the results are official/certified). If Modi renegs, that will likely be newsworthy itself. 331dot (talk) 23:16, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Weak oppose - as Wilhelm Tell DCCXLVI says, the BKU is still protesting. I would prefer waiting till the laws are actually repealed (and FWIW, these laws are being repealed just before the 2022 Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly elections and elections in some other states, which are crucial for Modi's political party). Tube·of·Light 02:30, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – On article quality – and as others have noted because the laws haven't taken effect.

And of course, there will be no "permanent cancellation of The Boat Race", that's total bollocks, but perhaps inline with your regular contributions. As you perhaps should know already, The Boat Race 2022 is scheduled for next year, and if COVID stymies it, one imagines it will simply be moved to the River Great Ouse once again. I'm unclear as to where you think that a lunar eclipse would be a portent for the permanent cancellation of an event which has been conducted since 1829, even before the Third Reich failed to play nicely. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 17:56, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Ease up, Ramblo, it was a joke. (And BTW, the Third Reich and this topic are entirely unrelated.) – Sca (talk) 18:26, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Yeah, and this topic and the Boat Race are completely unrelated. And it wasn't funny in any sense. So explain yourself. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 18:45, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support, this lunar eclipse has gotten significant news coverage.

The assassination itself, of course, would have been ITN-worthy, as would the convictions of the accused. To me, this is on the same level. BD2412 T 21:30, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Just remembered it won't make DYK as much of the content was copy/pasted from the main article, and it's not 5x from that. ITN it is! – Muboshgu (talk) 21:36, 17 November 2021 (UTC) It was also created nine months ago so any expansion at that time is far too old; you could conceivably get it through DYK if it passes as a Good Article though. ??????? ? 21:43, 17 November 2021 (UTC) It was just moved to mainspace. – Muboshgu (talk) 23:34, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Not only would this by DYK material, it's not even eligible per Muboshgu.

The two who are being exonerated are not independently notable and were released decades ago, so the actual impact is minimal.

The history books are not often changed in such a manner. 331dot (talk) 14:35, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Those two examples were incomparably more significant, as both victims were heads of state. – Sca (talk) 15:24, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Malcolm X was not a head of state but he was highly influential in the cause of civil rights. The point is that history is not often corrected as it was here. 331dot (talk) 16:53, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – per Modest Genius.

Joseph2302 (talk) 20:40, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: Perhaps the blurb can mention the evacuation of thousands of residents and the destruction of infrastructure. Power outage and a small death toll won't cut it. --PFHLai (talk) 22:35, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Comment - this is quite a significant event in Canada, with reports that it could become the most expensive natural disaster in Canadian history [16], the death toll is expected to rise, along with wide ranging effects on supply chains and transportation networks. If I recall correctly, I think we did post the 2013 Alberta floods, for precedent. Connormah (talk) 22:39, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I guess "could be" is key here. If it does become the most expensive natural disaster after electing Trudeau in the history of Canada, then it's well placed for a blurb. Maybe now is premature. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:42, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Wait Living through this, it's a pretty devastating disaster, with all road access cut off to and from the Port of Vancouver, which is having a major impact on supply chains across Western Canada. But I don't think this meets the standard previously set for ITN just yet, although there are reports that the death toll is expected to rise. There's also reports of an imminent dike breach into a large city. As such, I'd suggest that we wait. NorthernFalcon (talk) 22:51, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – Lots of damage & dislocation but so far only one fatal. – Sca (talk) 23:29, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Wait If this gets worse and deadlier, then I will support. Heythereimaguy (talk) 13:02, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Wait per NorthernFalcon & Sca. Modest Genius talk 13:16, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Comment I would further comment that given Port of Vancouver is affected (the fourth largest port in North America by volume of goods) the supply chain issues are pretty notable. [17] CaffeinAddict (talk) 23:11, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, just “affected” the fourth in North America. Not America. Not even in the world. Let's not overestimate it. Storms are storms, and it happen...a lot of things. International impact is very low. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 01:52, 21 November 2021 (UTC) The discussion above is closed. Please do not modify it.

Please read the guidelines. Admin instructions are here. ??Skip to suggestions In the news toolbox Error reports Nominations (Archives) Discussion General criteria Death criteria Recurring items Admin guide Image protection Current events portal v t e Shortcut WP:ITN/C This page provides a forum for editors to suggest items for inclusion on In the news (ITN), a protected template on the Main Page, as well as the forum for discussion of candidates. This is not the page to report errors in the ITN section on the Main Page—please go to the appropriate section at WP:ERRORS. Archives of past nominations can be found here. This candidates page is integrated with the daily pages of Portal:Current events. Under each daily section header below is the transcluded Portal:Current events items for that day (with a light green header). Each day's portal page is followed by a subsection for suggestions and discussion. A blurb is a one sentence summary of the news story. An alternate suggestion for the blurb is called an altblurb, and any more suggestions get labelled alt1, alt2, etc. A blurb needs at least one target article, highlighted in bold; reviewers check the quality of that article and whether it is updated, and whether reliable sources demonstrate the significance of the event. Other articles can also be linked. The Ongoing line is for regularly updated articles which cover events that remain in the news over a longer period of time. RD stands for the "recent deaths" line, and can include any living thing whose death was recently announced. In some cases, recent deaths may need additional explanation as provided by a blurb; this is decided by consensus.

Find the correct section below for the date of the event (not the date nominated). Do not add sections for new dates. These are automatically generated (at midnight UTC) by a bot; creating them manually breaks this process. Nominate the blurb for ITN inclusion under the "Suggestions" subheading for the date, emboldening the link in the blurb to the updated article. Use a level 4 header (====) when doing so. Preferably use the template {{ITN candidate}} to nominate the article related to the event in the news. Make sure that you include a reference from a verifiable, reliable secondary source. Press releases are not acceptable. The suggested blurb should be written in simple present tense. Adding an explanation why the event should be posted greatly increases the odds of posting. Please consider alerting editors to the nomination by adding the template {{ITN note}} to the corresponding article's talk page. Purge this page to update the cache There are criteria which guide the decision on whether or not to put a particular item on In the news, based largely on the extensiveness of the updated content and the perceived significance of the recent developments. These are listed at WP:ITN. Submissions that do not follow the guidelines at Wikipedia:In the news will not be placed onto the live template. Headers[edit] Items that have been posted or pulled from the main page are generally marked with (Posted) or (Pulled) in the item's subject so it is clear they are no longer active. Items can also be marked as (Ready) when the article is both updated and there seems to be a consensus to post. The posting admin, however, should always judge the update and the consensus to post themselves. If you find an entry that you don't feel is ready to post is marked (Ready), you should remove the mark in the header. Voicing an opinion on an item[edit] Format your comment to contain "support" or "oppose", and include a rationale for your choice. In particular, address the notability of the event, the quality of the article, and whether it has been updated. Please do not...[edit] add simple "support!" or "oppose!" votes without including your reasons. Similarly, curt replies such as "who?", "meh", or "duh!" are usually not helpful. Instead, explain the reasons why you think the item meets or does not meet the ITN inclusion criteria so a consensus can be reached. oppose an item because the event is only relating to a single country, or failing to relate to one. This applies to a high percentage of the content we post and is unproductive. accuse other editors of supporting, opposing or nominating due to a personal bias (such as ethnocentrism).

I refer to here. Yet another case with zero international impact and interest, yet another case of a purely local trial. Far from being akin to the conviction for the murder of George Floyd. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 20:46, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Alsoriano97 If "international impact" was required for postings, very little would be posted. 331dot (talk) 20:47, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, but it should be much more decisive when it comes to court rulings than in other cases (sports, science, elections...). If the follow-up of a trial has a very low international coverage/interest, will you tell me that it's not an important requirement to take into account when determining whether a court case is blurb-worthy or not? So many people are condemned every day in this world... _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 20:58, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Respectfully, we aren't talking about someone convicted of robbing the corner store, but a black man who was murdered basically for being in the wrong neighborhood in a part of the United States where convictions for this sort of thing are rare. And as I said, this incident has influenced changes in laws. 331dot (talk) 21:55, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support. This was a highly followed trial in the US, and even before the verdict this incident resulted in changes in Georgia law(the elimination of citizens' arrests). 331dot (talk) 20:52, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Article is also of decent quality from what I can see. 331dot (talk) 20:57, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support -- this verdict is likely to influence future trials of this type in the United States, and it is an historic decision in an area of the country known for its virulent racism. I doubt a jury would have reached this verdict in that area even 20 years ago. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 21:47, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support High profile case with notable legal impact, quality article. SpencerT•C 21:55, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support.

Whilst? – Sca (talk) 19:58, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose for now. Article is not developed enough to be ready for the main page. If that is fixed, it can be posted. Also, none of the blurbs link the article. That will need to be fixed. --Jayron32 20:04, 24 November 2021 (UTC) fixed now Llewee (talk) 21:01, 24 November 2021 (UTC) (Removed) Ongoing removal: 2021 Belarus–European Union border crisis[edit] Article: 2021 Belarus–European Union border crisis (talk · history · tag) Ongoing item removal (Post) Nominator's comments: The article has not has any significant updates for a week, and thus fails the ongoing criteria: In order to be posted to ongoing, the article needs to be regularly updated with new, pertinent information. If there have been significant updates in the last week, these should be added, but right now, this article fails the ongoing criteria. In particular, the last significant update is older than the day of the oldest ITN event (21 November), which is a general rule for something not being updated enough for Ongoing. Joseph2302 (talk) 12:26, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Remove. I think Belarus cleared out migrants from the border; Putin must think he made his point. 331dot (talk) 12:28, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Remove. The migrants have been moved away from the border and the situation has calmed down. No longer an ongoing event. Modest Genius talk 13:05, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – Although the situation appears to have been at least partially defused, there have been reports in recent days that in some cases Belorussian guards have continued to help migrants breach the border into Polish territory. [1], [2] [3] – Sca (talk) 13:27, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Remove the existence of news coverage that Sca notes is a necessary but not sufficient condition for maintaining an ongoing link. The article also needs to have been continuously updated. That clearly didn't happen here. --Jayron32 20:06, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – I have read the reports mentioned by Sca. It appears as if the situation have slowed down, but not ended. So still Ongoing.BabbaQ (talk) 20:23, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Removed.

(Post) Alternative blurb: ?Following the resignation of Stefan Löfven, Magdalena Andersson (pictured) is elected by the Riksdag as the first female Prime Minister of Sweden. Alternative blurb II: ?Magdalena Andersson (pictured) is elected as the first female Prime Minister of Sweden. News source(s): BBC Credits: Nominated by BastianMAT (talk · give credit) Article updated The nominated event is listed on WP:ITN/R, so each occurrence is presumed to be important enough to post. Comments should focus on whether the quality of the article and update meet WP:ITNCRIT, not the significance. Nominator's comments: ITNR, as it falls under "Changes in the holder of the office which administer the executive of their respective state/government, in those countries which qualify under the criteria above, as listed at List of current heads of state and government except when that change was already posted as part of a general election". First female prime minister of Sweden. BastianMAT (talk) 09:59, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment she takes office on the 26th (according to her article). Until that point, the blurb isn't correct, as she only becomes the first female PM of Sweden on that date. Is it usual to post when it's announced, or when they take office? Joseph2302 (talk) 10:04, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Usually when they are elected but yeah with the blurb of being elected. BastianMAT (talk) 10:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support - First female PM in Sweden. But change blurb to ”is elected” instead becomes.BabbaQ (talk) 10:06, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Yes. BastianMAT (talk) 10:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support Significant as new PM and first female. Perhaps the blub should be "elected by the Riksdag" since she didn't gain office through a normal election (by the people). cart-Talk 10:15, 24 November 2021 (UTC) That's normal in a parliamentary system. – Sca (talk) 15:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment The blurb should probably start with "Following the resignation of Stefan Löfven, ..." to provide context, since this was not an election outcome but a government reshuffle. --Tone 10:20, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support now the blurb has been changed to "is elected" seems fine to run now. Agree with Tone that we should make it clearer that this wasn't an election that caused this. Joseph2302 (talk) 11:01, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support Her article looks great, is ITNR and altblurb, although somewhat long, it's the most complete and clear of all. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 11:31, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Posting. --Tone 11:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Would suggest that we use the image of Andersson at the front page.BabbaQ (talk) 11:49, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Agree with this, we usually use the image for the newest blurb. Joseph2302 (talk) 14:32, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Post-posting support This is historic. -TenorTwelve (talk) 14:30, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Since Sweden's in the EU, perhaps she'll become the next Merkel. – Sca (talk) 15:25, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Then again, maybe not. – Sca (talk) 20:01, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Update by the nominator Things are looking bad for her and her party now. The Center Party (liberal) voted for the opposition’s budget and it got through. The Center party did not agree with the goverment’s budget, stating it was way too left. That would mean Magdallena now has to rule with right wing economic politics, which she accepted. However their junior party the Green party did not accept it and have left the goverment meaning a new Riksdag election for the prime minister post shall be held. Interesting development. SVT BastianMAT (talk) 16:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Update 2 by nominator Magdallena Andersson has officially resigned. We might have to pull the news back as she won’t be assuming office. She will only assume office if she wins a new prime minister vote, which might take place in a few days/weeks, depending on how the talks with the speaker goes. SVT BastianMAT (talk) 16:46, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Pull (or update the blurb). Her resignation is quickly making international news. 142.182.136.105 (talk) 17:38, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Update blurb Move over Kim Campbell, there's a new sheriff in town. Or more precisely, there was one for a few hours.Scaramouche33 (talk) 17:58, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Pull until it's confirmed whether she will now be the leader or not. Joseph2302 (talk) 18:01, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose pull What is ITNR is that a few hours ago she has been elected by the Swedish parliament. However much she has resigned. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 18:20, 24 November 2021 (UTC) What updating with "and immediately resigns" or something? This is a really weird sequence of events. --Tone 18:21, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Pull - The blurb, as it currently stands, is false.--WaltCip-(talk) 18:50, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Updated to Magdalena Andersson (pictured), shortly after being elected as the first female prime minister of Sweden, resigns. Any further changes, please? --PFHLai (talk) 19:13, 24 November 2021 (UTC) I think this is fine now. --Tone 19:25, 24 November 2021 (UTC) I'm not a big fan of blurbs that contemplate the resignation of a prime minister...But knowing a bit of precedent, it's very likely that in a few days/weeks she will be re-elected, as happened with Löfven in the middle of this year. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 19:48, 24 November 2021 (UTC) For the record, I support this new blurb. It will work until she is finally elected the new PM in a few days or at the longest a week.BabbaQ (talk) 20:21, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks. Hopefully, we'll have an update about her taking office soon. That would be a simple update to do. --PFHLai (talk) 20:31, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Pull -- wait until she actually is seated. She just resigned. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 21:22, 24 November 2021 (UTC) The blurb already says that. It's fine. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 21:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) It's probably just my own bias here; but it seems silly to post this when she just resigned. Forming coalition governments in a parliamentary system is weird. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 21:45, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART)[edit] Article: Double Asteroid Redirection Test (talk · history · tag) Blurb: ?NASA launches DART – the first attempt to change the course of an asteroid (pictured) (Post) Alternative blurb: ?The Double Asteroid Redirection Test spacecraft is launched on a mission to the asteroid Didymos and its moon Dimorphos (artist's impression pictured) Alternative blurb II: ?The Double Asteroid Redirection Test spacecraft is launched on a mission to attempt to deflect the course of the asteroid Dimorphos (artist's impression pictured) News source(s): BBC, Guardian, NYT Credits: Nominated by Andrew Davidson (talk · give credit) Created by Frmorrison (talk · give credit) Updated by CRS-20 (talk · give credit) Article updated Nominator's comments: There's going to be a follow-up launching in 2024 and arriving in 2027 so it's quite a long-term plan. But it's in the news now. Andrew?(talk) 08:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support important mission with global implications, good article. Polyamorph (talk) 08:18, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment. This may be notable as the first mission of its type (to post now); it will be ITNR when it arrives as well. Just saying. 331dot (talk) 08:19, 24 November 2021 (UTC) This may be ITN/R per "first ... launches of any type of rocket" as it's the first mission to use the NEXT drive but that's debatable. Andrew?(talk) 10:09, 24 November 2021 (UTC) The NEXT is the thruster on the spacecraft, not the rocket that put it up there(a Falcon 9). 331dot (talk) 12:31, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Such missions usually have multiple stages and each stage has separate rocket engines. The first stage is usually more spectacular but there's no scientific reason to prefer it. For deep space missions lasting years, the efficiency of the final spacecraft will be most important and this is a new design. Andrew?(talk) 12:54, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support important global mission (even if it does sound like DART is copying the plot of Salvation (TV series)). Added 3 cn tags to article, but apart from that, it looks more than good enough article quality for the front page. Joseph2302 (talk) 09:13, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support Everyone in the world should be happy we'll finally have a way to stop any doomsday asteroids from wiping us all out. Dream Focus 11:15, 24 November 2021 (UTC) If it works, of course... _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 11:39, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support is ITNR from what Andrew says and the global impact of this mission is undoubted, so it's clearly notable. In fact I think it should be one of the most important scientific news of the year. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 11:39, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Global impact?? I thought the idea was to avoid that! Martinevans123 (talk) 13:52, 24 November 2021 (UTC) This event can't be notable, its only impact is on a small unpopulated asteroid! WaltCip-(talk) 14:17, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Impactfulness nonapparent at this pt. in time & space. – Sca (talk) 15:00, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment the proposed blurb is a mess. I've added alt1, though for some reason that's messing up the template formatting - I can't work out why. Modest Genius talk 13:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Also, this is not ITNR, as it's not a new type of rocket and interplanetary probes are ITNR when they arrive at their destination, not when launched. But the gap here is long enough (ten months) that it's reasonable to post both launch and arrival. Modest Genius talk 13:15, 24 November 2021 (UTC) @Modest Genius: I fixed the formatting issue. Adding italics to either of the blurbs breaks it, because italics are already applied by default.--WaltCip-(talk) 13:26, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks. Modest Genius talk 13:44, 24 November 2021 (UTC) The fact that the mission is attempting to alter the course of the asteroid makes this particularly notable. Added alt2. Polyamorph (talk) 13:40, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Alt2 is incorrect. It won't 'deflect the course' of the asteroid. The impact will modify orbit of the moon around the asteroid, not either of their orbits around the Sun. Modest Genius talk 13:44, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Dimorphos is an asteroid (albeit a minor one compared to Didymos). It will deflect its course. Nothing to do with the Sun. Polyamorph (talk) 13:46, 24 November 2021 (UTC) It may deflect its course. – Sca (talk) 15:06, 24 November 2021 (UTC) It will deflect it, even if by only a negligible amount. But this is covered by the wording of alt2 "on a mission to attempt to deflect the course". Polyamorph (talk) 15:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – From what I've seen, this is such a complicated, long-term project that any significant results may be years off. – Sca (talk) 13:30, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose - no mention of Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck or Michael Bay. But seriously Support, though I'd recommend that gallery be trimmed down. --Masem (t) 15:03, 24 November 2021 (UTC) You forgot to mention Taylor Swift. – Sca (talk) 15:07, 24 November 2021 (UTC) @Sca: You mean Liv Tyler :) Brandmeistertalk 20:05, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support ALT2 Very significant, and definitely should be in ITN.

The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 10:35, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Over a million people die on the roads every year – that's over 3,000 every day.

Joseph2302 (talk) 08:35, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Not terrorism, according to "sources", so whilst tragic, it appears to be a worse-than-usual crime gone wrong. Black Kite (talk) 08:44, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support -- It seems that around five people died in the attack. The perpetrator has been reported by a few media outlets as Daniel Brooks, a black man who raps under the name "MathboiFly" and has tons of social media posts supporting BLM, and this was in the aftermath of a very notable event where Rittenhouse was cleared as killing two black men in self-defence. OldPeace7068 (talk) 09:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Complete extrapolation. Police have said they believe he was on the run having committed a separate crime, nothing to do with Rittenhouse at all. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 09:35, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Wikipedia is there to report the facts. Police and many members of the public initially considered the possibility of Islamic terrorism due to similar incidents in the past involving Muslims, the targeting of a western festival, and the recent rise in Islamic terrorist activity, but police have now confirmed that this is not terrorism related. Similarly, there have been widespread links/controversy made between the rapper and his connections to BLM, and it has been linked to Rittenhouse whether you like it or not. It is part of the story. The killer is a major supporter and activist of BLM. And this happened in the aftermath of Rittenhouse's acquittal. It's all part of the background and developing story. OldPeace7068 (talk) 09:45, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Not at all. The police have stated he was fleeing a separate scene. Conflating this with BLM/Rittenhouse is pure crystal balling. Thanks. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 09:47, 22 November 2021 (UTC) "two black men" and you'd think we were on a website about facts... CharredWaffle (talk) 14:04, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. Calling this an "attack" may be a misnomer as it appears that the suspect was fleeing the police, not that it was a preplanned attack or terrorism. 331dot (talk) 12:50, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Maybe so. OTOH, at least one report quotes a witness as saying the vehicle seemed to be "targeting people" as it veered from side to side. Also, reports say it crashed through barriers to reach the parade, which seems to indicate that it was indeed an attack, though possibly not a pre-planned one. – Sca (talk) 16:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment The blurb should (and currently does not) mention the country in which this event took place. Chrisclear (talk) 12:56, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose - It's not at all clear that this is an act of terrorism, and thus not something that would be imminently notable.--WaltCip-(talk) 13:09, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose both on merit and article quality. As of this comment, the incident does not appear to have been a deliberate attack. I would be open to reconsideration if contrary information comes to light. Also, at present the article is little more than an oversized stub. It's not ready for the main page. -Ad Orientem (talk) 13:13, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support ... pending expansion of article, which presently comprises a mere 250 words, i.e. a stub.

ArsenalGhanaPartey (talk) 15:31, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment If the incident turns out not to be terrorist motivated, I honestly don't see it in Main Page, and if it's , with five dead, I 'mnot very clear, although the number of injured is dantesque. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 15:51, 22 November 2021 (UTC) If this is confirmed as an unfortunate series of events with no purposeful motivating factor (driver escaping from knife fight and inadvertently ran through parade crowd), then I would agree this is not really something that should be posted. This doesn't mean motiveless events can't ever be posted but I would expect the results to be more devasting (like the various major building fires or collapses that we had). --Masem (t) 16:36, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Exactly, I think the same Masem. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 17:30, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Wait – As an AP update seems to suggest this was the act of a lone nutcase with a record, I've withdrawn my provisonal support. However, it seems we're still in a wait situation, since nine of the injured are listed in critical condition. If the toll were to rise to double digits, we might still want to consider a blurb about this very nasty event. – Sca (talk) 18:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support if the motivation turns out to be terrorism, neutral if otherwise. Mlb96 (talk) 19:04, 22 November 2021 (UTC) A post – by an IT user with no other contributions – on our article's talk page posits racial motivation.

The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 19:11, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Please see expanded comment above. Thanks. – Sca (talk) 19:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support. This event is in the news and the article looks to be in good shape. -- Tavix (talk) 19:38, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: – Since perp's been ID'd & police say he'll face five counts of first-degree intentional homicide, this is looking potentially more significant. – Sca (talk) 20:02, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Per The Independent this guy had a domestic dispute, and drove his car like a lunatic. Not terror-related, just an idiot behind the wheel. Not significant, tragic, but will never make the top 1000 things that happened on Planet Earth in 2021, let alone the top 250. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support - a mass-casualty event, receiving international coverage (e.g., BBC), a suspect is being charged, and the article has been improved to sufficient quality. Levivich 20:04, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support - rare (even in the US) mass-casualty event. Article quality is decent. Destroyeraa (Alternate account) 20:28, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment a road traffic accident in the US is not rare. Mass-casualty events in the US are far from rare. It's pretty obvious that giving this tragic yet non-terrorist/non-BLM/non-protest/non-deliberate accident undue prominence is not what the encyclopedia was designed to do. Of course, you can dig into the BBC website and find coverage, it's all "shock and think of the children" in the US, but the rest of the world has moved on the moment it was clear it was a sad instance of a crime somewhere else having shitty side-effects, and literally nothing more. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) The last time I remember a similar incident happened in the US was late 2017 when somebody plowed into a crowd in Virginia after a violent demonstration got broken up. We posted the event that it was tangentially related to, largely on the strength of somebody plowing their car into a crowd and killing someone. You supported posting it. Rockphed (talk) 01:03, 23 November 2021 (UTC) If you're referring to Charlottesville car attack, that was about a man deliberately setting out to ram people. This is about a man trying to escape the scene of a domestic incident and getting into a road traffic accident. The two are incomparable. But good try. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 08:07, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Agreeing with previous posters, posting this event would seem to be giving undue weight to a tragic traffic accident. Comparison with the Charlottesville incident from several years back is unfair, given the explicitly political motivations of the earlier event. Wizardoftheyear (talk) 01:17, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Neutral and Wait Yes, with the additional details that have come to light, this is literally a domestic issue that had decidedly more tragic consequences. However, that is additional details. The initial response, and the fact there were several fatalities during a celebration, caught on camera and shared around the world before anyone knew what was going on, has made this major news and a source of intrigue. I think we need to wait to see if the news stations drop their coverage now that there is less intrigue and crisis; if it has effectively left the news cycle by end of day, take this as an oppose, but if it is still on the news banners, take this as support. Kingsif (talk) 01:42, 23 November 2021 (UTC) 4 of the 12 paragraphs in this article start "On November 2X". Typical anti-American bias from the Brits (which is far from rare) notwithstanding, the quality is not there yet. GreatCaesarsGhost 02:23, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Support - Tragic, criminally-induced mass-casualty. Significant details are now known.

This at first got attention because it might have been terrorism related, no problem there. But all we are left with now is an accident which leaves 5 death: while tragic, this is sadly an everyday occurrence. We have e.g. this week a ferry accident in Sri Lanka (at least 6 death)[5], 7 death in Greece when migrants flee the police[6], 22 deaths on Lake Kivu[7], nine deaths in a fire in Bulgaria[8], 10 deaths in China after a car crash[9], ... I see no reason to post this, as it is not exceptional, has no lasting importance, and isn't even very interesting (without the terrorism angle). It's a sad tragedy, but a very common one. Fram (talk) 17:03, 23 November 2021 (UTC) I think it is WP:TOOSOON to make a determination as to whether this was an act of terror or not. Terrorism or not, the ramming appears to be deliberate, and it has made national and international headlines. Aasim (talk) 06:53, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose.

Major election in an EU member state. – Illegitimate Barrister (talk • contribs), 02:46, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Question Do we post presidential elections even if the president has mostly symbolic roles? Scaramouche33 (talk) 07:32, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, heads of state elections are posted even if they are ceremonial/wield little power, it mostly depends on the article quality itself which should be more than sufficient. Two examples are the Italian presidental election and Czech presidental election, both having similar powers to the Bulgarian one. [10] [11] BastianMAT (talk) 09:02, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Weak support this article has been on front page for a week already, but I guess the second round presidency vote means that it's ITN eligible again. Article looks to have been sufficiently updated about the presidential second round vote. Joseph2302 (talk) 12:10, 22 November 2021 (UTC) This is not ITNR. We no longer post all elections for head of state- we post the election/choosing of the official with actual executive power, according to List of current heads of state and government; in Bulgaria that is the PM, not the president. 331dot (talk) 12:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) In which case, I oppose this nomination, and it shouldn't have been tagged as ITNR. Joseph2302 (talk) 12:37, 22 November 2021 (UTC) In fairness, it is a recent change that not everyone may be aware of. 331dot (talk) 12:41, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Alright, I thought going by older posts that head of state elections are still part of ITNR but if its been removed, no problem and thanks for the headsup for future nominations. BastianMAT (talk) 12:46, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I just saw this now. I must have missed the change or forgot about it. So my comment on other presidents is not relevant here. --Tone 17:49, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Exactly, that’s what got me confused to when I ITNR nominated this. In the past as you and I mentioned, similar head of state elections (with similar powers) such as Moldova(November 2020), Germany, Austria, Italy, Czech Republic have been posted. 331dot said the removal of ceremonial head of state elections from ITNR were ’recently’ done, so the change must have not been too long ago for us to not know that.BastianMAT (talk) 18:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Blurb on MainPage was updated and moved up --PFHLai (talk) 13:11, 22 November 2021 (UTC) PFHLai there wasn't consensus to do this update- the presidential election is not ITNR, and there was not consensus here that it's important enough for ITN. We should leave it where it is, so it can roll off soon, instead of moving it up so it'll stay on ITN for another week... Joseph2302 (talk) 13:27, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Post posting support If the election was stand-alone, we would probably post it. This is just the case where the general election were held together with the first round of presidential, so there is a single article. I don't see a problem. --Tone 14:56, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I doubt we would post this as a standalone item. He may be head of state, but he has no power. It's the Prime Minister of Bulgaria who would be posted automatically.  — Amakuru (talk) 17:18, 22 November 2021 (UTC) In fact he has been in de facto power since the 2021 April elections as he appointed his friend as acting prime minister. The de jure power he wields is similar to those in Italy and Czech Republic, where he gets to nominate the prime minister and supreme court judges, he can veto laws (although parliament can override) and he of course serves as head of state, don’t forget Bulgaria even has a vice president. In the past we have posted the Italian presidental and Czech Republic presidental elections, both are parliamantary republics too. I thought it was ITNR, but 331dot mentioned that head of state elections (where the head of state is not head of goverment) was recently removed from ITNR. Italian presidental election posted Czech Republic presidental election posted BastianMAT (talk) 17:32, 22 November 2021 (UTC) (ec) As far as I remember we post both if the articles are ok. We've posted presidents of Austria and Germany, which have a similar role, for example. Furthermore, the president of Germany is elected by Bundestag, not by a popular vote. --Tone 17:36, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Pull update and Revert back to previous version per Joseph2302. This guy is just a figure head, and we already posted the main election result. There was no reason to have bumped this up, and the result is not ITN/R so needs consensus, which it doesn't have.  — Amakuru (talk) 17:14, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Pull update and agree with above, not seeing consensus here for this to have even been posted in the first instance. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 17:21, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Beyond the issue of whether it should be on the main page, the blurb is clumsy. "In Bulgaria," is redundant. Where else but in Bulgaria would you be elected President of Bulgaria? Schwede66 17:57, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Restored old blurb. --PFHLai (talk) 18:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose pull Not a head of state change but in the same spirit This post was made by orbitalbuzzsaw gang (talk) 19:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment I think we need some kind of page break to restart voting. A lot of the opposition above was to the unilateral action and not the nom itself. as for me, Oppose while there are some states with significant power invested in the secondary office, this is not one of them. GreatCaesarsGhost 21:55, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I didn't particularly mind about the unilateral action myself - it was made in good faith - and my oppose is purely on the merits of the case, for much the same reasons as you.

The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 23:23, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Not that it matters to this nomination, but Rittenhouse's victims were white. GreatCaesarsGhost 00:04, 20 November 2021 (UTC) *cough cough* Rittenhouse's victims were white *cough cough* – John M Wolfson (talk • contribs) 00:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Who said he wasn't talking about Young Dolph's routine assassin? We don't know he wasn't white. We don't know if he had other black American victims. Memphis is all about unsolved mysteries! AGF. InedibleHulk (talk) 02:06, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose on quality The article needs a lot of work, as there are multiple sections with no inline citations.Pawnkingthree (talk) 23:42, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support While this might be unduly implicative of the Chinese state being connected, if RSs are making that connection this definitely belongs. – John M Wolfson (talk • contribs) 00:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose on quality I would support this if the article has some ref work done. There's sections that are unsourced. --TDKR Chicago 101 (talk) 00:34, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose this is newsworthy for sure but blurbing that someone "disappeared" after making an accusation seems like a WP:BLPCRIME issue to me. --LaserLegs (talk) 00:39, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Completely agree it's an awkward thing to summarise in a way that fits BLP while keeping it clear why the event is notable, I'd welcome suggestions for alternative phrasing. I realise this is a fairly limited action, but for that reason I deliberately didn't link to the person she accused in the proposed blurb. Blythwood (talk) 01:57, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose as per LaserLegs, there's something wrong about posting speculation that someone disappeared straight after they made accusations. With little reliable information, this seems like a BLP issue to post it. Joseph2302 (talk) 01:47, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Far too speculative, with overtones of anti-China sentiment, and with too many unknowns. Needs far more clarification before it is posted. And a guarantee that ITN will publish a full We Were Wrong! statement and retraction on the Main page when it is found out she has just eloped with her boyfriend or girlfriend, as the case may be. HiLo48 (talk) 01:55, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Clearly if China "disappeared" her, that would be a story, but this appears to be Western nations making a demand of China and there's no hard evidence she has been killed or imprisoned or the like. We don't post this type of speculative stories. --Masem (t) 02:16, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support Per wide coverage in RSes. Normchou?? 03:22, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose unless the incident has a separate article. Sun8908?Talk 07:38, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support — article looks decent enough for ITN standards by my eye, wide coverage in RSes. If the choice of "disappears" is undesirable, then "is reported missing" might be a potential alternative (posted as altblurb). [osunpokeh/talk/contributions] 08:41, 20 November 2021 (UTC) I think that suggests she was reported missing in the police report sense, not that Novak Djokovic described her as "a missing person" to reporters. Not a bad idea. Just a bit ambiguous. InedibleHulk (talk) 09:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Strong support, in the news, top page news in many countries. The issue is she has suddenly disappeared after accusing a senior cabinet minister of a serious crime, and the involved parties are public figures indept of this incident, so there is nothing wrong as long as it is sourced and not stated as truth. Peng's disappearance and the resulting sports diplomacy pressure and boycott threats are sufficient Bumbubookworm (talk) 12:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Have you ever studied the difference between correlation and causation? HiLo48 (talk) 21:48, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Yes I have and I wonder if it's possible to have a maths competition over Wikipedia lol. I never said there was a causation, although I am sure many on Wikipedia have noted your hard-left POV eg trying to get all right of centre Australian newspapers struck off at RSN. Bumbubookworm (talk) 22:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Applause.

Something that may have happened isn't blurbworthy, no matter how widely it's hyped. – Sca (talk) 13:05, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose per Masem, Sca.

Polyamorph (talk) 20:03, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support per above. The article has unref'd sections about her tennis career, but the linked section is ready. Davey2116 (talk) 21:52, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. We shouldn't (and don't) post articles with multiple unsourced sections. The fact that the section linked in bold is referenced is irrelevant. Black Kite (talk) 23:26, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Wait Let's wait until we are 100% sure what has happened to her. Heythereimaguy (talk) 23:53, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Global Times continues to point to her, this time at a restaurant with a coach and friends, seemingly quite visible. Western speculation now turns to whether she's safe, though, or free from external interference or to be believed. All very personal and hard-to-answer questions, for anybody anywhere. InedibleHulk (talk) 00:10, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose it's just one person in a world where much worse things happen in other places like Ethiopia. Banedon (talk) 01:11, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose for now. Videos of Peng Shuai have supposedly surfaced. Nice4What (talk · contribs) – (Thanks ?) 03:30, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Support However, I propose removing the term 'Chinese' in front of Peng Shuai. It does not add to her character or her identity as a professional tennis player. Something along the lines of "Professional tennis player Peng Shuai disappears after accusing former Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli of sexual assault." would be better imo. However, we should also note the videos posted by Global Times editors (primarily those tweeted by editor-in-chief Hu Xijin) and their aftermath. JMonkey2006 (talk) 11:10, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – She's reappeared, online at least. End of story? – Sca (talk) 13:34, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Strong support Wide coverage by RSes and notable. Fakescientist8000 (talk) 14:05, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Still too murky and speculative, with little general impact. – Sca (talk) 15:24, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Leaving aside anything else, there is video evidence of her out and about so she hasn't been "disappeared" and isn't "missing". Whether or not something else is happening is in the realm of speculation, and would require a separate blurb. Also, very large swathes of the article on her career lack even a single citation.

This applies to a high percentage of the content we post and is unproductive." "International notability" is not a criteria for posting at ITN, nor has it ever been. --Jayron32 19:05, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Well my direct opinion is that it is not notable. My reasoning is the discussion that already took place on the 2021 talk page. I also have previous discussions months ago where things highly notable to one country aren’t included. Elijahandskip (talk) 19:11, 19 November 2021 (UTC) This is not a discussion of the page 2021. The criteria established for other parts of Wikipedia don't apply here. If you wish to change the criteria used for the ITN box, then start a discussion at WT:ITN. Votes without valid rationales are given little weight. It's fine if you have a useful rationale, but merely "I don't think it's notable enough" does not provide any useful guidance to admins when deciding consensus. I mean, you're allowed to say any silly thing you want, I suppose, but you can't expect anyone to take you seriously if it isn't valid. --Jayron32 19:18, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Well since you don’t like my reasoning, just let me say “no”. People have supported ITN’s in the past without giving a reason, so my “Oppose” in this case will not have a reason. Elijahandskip (talk) 19:22, 19 November 2021 (UTC) As I said, it's a free world. People do nonsensical things all of the time. --Jayron32 19:24, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Yep, I couldn’t agree more. In reality, my oppose on this comes more to combat American Wikipedia vs English Wikipedia. There is a essay on Wikipedia that I recently read that has that meaning. Not everything that happens in America is notable for Wikipedia/2021/ITN/Portal Current Events, etc….Elijahandskip (talk) 19:34, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose (at least on news of just the verdict). It was a highly watched case in the U.S., but it was clear early on to many legal experts that are crying foul on judicial behavior. It is very very likely to see an appeal and so this is not the end. This is not like the result from the very public George Floyd protests (which we posted and had ongoing about those, and the verdict). That said, there had been concerns there may be rioting following an acquittal , and while I'm not seeing any immediate news on that, a major riot (akin to the LA riots after King's verdict) would likely be the newsworthy factor here. --Masem (t) 19:05, 19 November 2021 (UTC) There literally cannot be any appeal of a not guilty verdict. This is a core principle of how double jeopardy is handled in American jurisprudence. A not guilty jury verdict is basically always final. See [12]. There are some exceedingly rare exceptions to this, but none of them would apply in this case. An ordinary jury verdict of "not guilty" like this one (even in a controversial trial) is treated as basically sacrosanct, and there can be no appeals by the government. --Jayron32 19:08, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Except for the calls for a mistrial that are being entered now. I know there's complexities with double jeopardy there, but that's still on the books and that itself can be a legal process. --Masem (t) 19:15, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Um, what? There were calls for a mistrial by Rittenhouse's defense team prior to the jury verdict coming back. Now that the verdict is in their client's favor, I doubt highly they will press forward with these requests. Indeed, articles such as this one note "The verdict also meant that Judge Bruce Schroeder did not have to rule on the defense's motions for a mistrial." --Jayron32 19:23, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose as above. If we had to have an American court psychodrama today, the better option from a world-historical perspective would probably be the acquittal of the purported killers of Malcolm X. —Brigade Piron (talk) 19:20, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose AGF, but this is such a small story in the grand scheme. GreatCaesarsGhost 19:23, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Wait. It is too early to tell what impact this will have. It could be a Rodney King-like result where acquittal of the accused leads to broad social unrest, or it could pass with a shrug. I expect that we will know within 24 hours.

I wonder if we should put this blurb up now, or when Parliament repeals them and the farmers go home (don't have strong opinions either way, but I lean towards waiting). If we're going to put it up now, I've uploaded this screengrab of Modi's announcement from his CC-BY YouTube channel; we could use it. Btw Indefensible - Dracophyllum was the only updater, not DiplomatTesterMan. Kind regards, W. Tell DCCXLVI (talk to me!/c) 07:05, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Using the update to put back in ongoing instead of a final blurb would be fine too if preferable. And DiplomatTesterMan did more updates on the article before that, he still deserves some credit too I think. - Indefensible (talk) 07:12, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose because the article is not sufficiently updated. There is currently a 1 sentence mention in the lead of the repeal of the laws, and no mention of it, nor of any follow-on protests, anywhere in the body of the article. Before this can be posted, the latest developments would need to be added to the article appropriately. --Jayron32 12:18, 19 November 2021 (UTC) @Jayron32 Have you read the repeal section? Dracophyllum 20:10, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Your response is 8 hours after Jayron32's, Dracophyllum. The section may have not existed when Jayron commented. But then again, I am not going to take the time to check if it did exist at 12:18 PM UTC on 19 Nov 2021. Tube·of·Light 02:30, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: The announcement by itself has no legal value. Parliament has to repeal the laws, which it will probably do in the coming Winter Session. Also some farmer's unions are continuing protests until the laws are repealed and minimum support prices reconsidered. So it might be better to wait, but no strong opinion either way. --Jose Mathew (talk) 12:24, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Wait and see what the impact of this is.

In fact, we do post many India-centric stories here, this one having festered in ongoing for nearly a year. --LaserLegs (talk) 23:36, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support. Invariably it is announcements that get more attention than the actual act, most of the time(we post elections when the result is known, not when the results are official/certified). If Modi renegs, that will likely be newsworthy itself. 331dot (talk) 23:16, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Weak oppose - as Wilhelm Tell DCCXLVI says, the BKU is still protesting. I would prefer waiting till the laws are actually repealed (and FWIW, these laws are being repealed just before the 2022 Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly elections and elections in some other states, which are crucial for Modi's political party). Tube·of·Light 02:30, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – On article quality – and as others have noted because the laws haven't taken effect.

And of course, there will be no "permanent cancellation of The Boat Race", that's total bollocks, but perhaps inline with your regular contributions. As you perhaps should know already, The Boat Race 2022 is scheduled for next year, and if COVID stymies it, one imagines it will simply be moved to the River Great Ouse once again. I'm unclear as to where you think that a lunar eclipse would be a portent for the permanent cancellation of an event which has been conducted since 1829, even before the Third Reich failed to play nicely. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 17:56, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Ease up, Ramblo, it was a joke. (And BTW, the Third Reich and this topic are entirely unrelated.) – Sca (talk) 18:26, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Yeah, and this topic and the Boat Race are completely unrelated. And it wasn't funny in any sense. So explain yourself. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 18:45, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support, this lunar eclipse has gotten significant news coverage.

The assassination itself, of course, would have been ITN-worthy, as would the convictions of the accused. To me, this is on the same level. BD2412 T 21:30, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Just remembered it won't make DYK as much of the content was copy/pasted from the main article, and it's not 5x from that. ITN it is! – Muboshgu (talk) 21:36, 17 November 2021 (UTC) It was also created nine months ago so any expansion at that time is far too old; you could conceivably get it through DYK if it passes as a Good Article though. ??????? ? 21:43, 17 November 2021 (UTC) It was just moved to mainspace. – Muboshgu (talk) 23:34, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Not only would this by DYK material, it's not even eligible per Muboshgu.

The two who are being exonerated are not independently notable and were released decades ago, so the actual impact is minimal.

The history books are not often changed in such a manner. 331dot (talk) 14:35, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Those two examples were incomparably more significant, as both victims were heads of state. – Sca (talk) 15:24, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Malcolm X was not a head of state but he was highly influential in the cause of civil rights. The point is that history is not often corrected as it was here. 331dot (talk) 16:53, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – per Modest Genius.

Joseph2302 (talk) 20:40, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: Perhaps the blurb can mention the evacuation of thousands of residents and the destruction of infrastructure. Power outage and a small death toll won't cut it. --PFHLai (talk) 22:35, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Comment - this is quite a significant event in Canada, with reports that it could become the most expensive natural disaster in Canadian history [16], the death toll is expected to rise, along with wide ranging effects on supply chains and transportation networks. If I recall correctly, I think we did post the 2013 Alberta floods, for precedent. Connormah (talk) 22:39, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I guess "could be" is key here. If it does become the most expensive natural disaster after electing Trudeau in the history of Canada, then it's well placed for a blurb. Maybe now is premature. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:42, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Wait Living through this, it's a pretty devastating disaster, with all road access cut off to and from the Port of Vancouver, which is having a major impact on supply chains across Western Canada. But I don't think this meets the standard previously set for ITN just yet, although there are reports that the death toll is expected to rise. There's also reports of an imminent dike breach into a large city. As such, I'd suggest that we wait. NorthernFalcon (talk) 22:51, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – Lots of damage & dislocation but so far only one fatal. – Sca (talk) 23:29, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Wait If this gets worse and deadlier, then I will support. Heythereimaguy (talk) 13:02, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Wait per NorthernFalcon & Sca. Modest Genius talk 13:16, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Comment I would further comment that given Port of Vancouver is affected (the fourth largest port in North America by volume of goods) the supply chain issues are pretty notable. [17] CaffeinAddict (talk) 23:11, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, just “affected” the fourth in North America. Not America. Not even in the world. Let's not overestimate it. Storms are storms, and it happen...a lot of things. International impact is very low. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 01:52, 21 November 2021 (UTC) The discussion above is closed. Please do not modify it.

Please read the guidelines. Admin instructions are here. ??Skip to suggestions In the news toolbox Error reports Nominations (Archives) Discussion General criteria Death criteria Recurring items Admin guide Image protection Current events portal v t e Shortcut WP:ITN/C This page provides a forum for editors to suggest items for inclusion on In the news (ITN), a protected template on the Main Page, as well as the forum for discussion of candidates. This is not the page to report errors in the ITN section on the Main Page—please go to the appropriate section at WP:ERRORS. Archives of past nominations can be found here. This candidates page is integrated with the daily pages of Portal:Current events. Under each daily section header below is the transcluded Portal:Current events items for that day (with a light green header). Each day's portal page is followed by a subsection for suggestions and discussion. A blurb is a one sentence summary of the news story. An alternate suggestion for the blurb is called an altblurb, and any more suggestions get labelled alt1, alt2, etc. A blurb needs at least one target article, highlighted in bold; reviewers check the quality of that article and whether it is updated, and whether reliable sources demonstrate the significance of the event. Other articles can also be linked. The Ongoing line is for regularly updated articles which cover events that remain in the news over a longer period of time. RD stands for the "recent deaths" line, and can include any living thing whose death was recently announced. In some cases, recent deaths may need additional explanation as provided by a blurb; this is decided by consensus.

Find the correct section below for the date of the event (not the date nominated). Do not add sections for new dates. These are automatically generated (at midnight UTC) by a bot; creating them manually breaks this process. Nominate the blurb for ITN inclusion under the "Suggestions" subheading for the date, emboldening the link in the blurb to the updated article. Use a level 4 header (====) when doing so. Preferably use the template {{ITN candidate}} to nominate the article related to the event in the news. Make sure that you include a reference from a verifiable, reliable secondary source. Press releases are not acceptable. The suggested blurb should be written in simple present tense. Adding an explanation why the event should be posted greatly increases the odds of posting. Please consider alerting editors to the nomination by adding the template {{ITN note}} to the corresponding article's talk page. Purge this page to update the cache There are criteria which guide the decision on whether or not to put a particular item on In the news, based largely on the extensiveness of the updated content and the perceived significance of the recent developments. These are listed at WP:ITN. Submissions that do not follow the guidelines at Wikipedia:In the news will not be placed onto the live template. Headers[edit] Items that have been posted or pulled from the main page are generally marked with (Posted) or (Pulled) in the item's subject so it is clear they are no longer active. Items can also be marked as (Ready) when the article is both updated and there seems to be a consensus to post. The posting admin, however, should always judge the update and the consensus to post themselves. If you find an entry that you don't feel is ready to post is marked (Ready), you should remove the mark in the header. Voicing an opinion on an item[edit] Format your comment to contain "support" or "oppose", and include a rationale for your choice. In particular, address the notability of the event, the quality of the article, and whether it has been updated. Please do not...[edit] add simple "support!" or "oppose!" votes without including your reasons. Similarly, curt replies such as "who?", "meh", or "duh!" are usually not helpful. Instead, explain the reasons why you think the item meets or does not meet the ITN inclusion criteria so a consensus can be reached. oppose an item because the event is only relating to a single country, or failing to relate to one. This applies to a high percentage of the content we post and is unproductive. accuse other editors of supporting, opposing or nominating due to a personal bias (such as ethnocentrism).

I refer to here. Yet another case with zero international impact and interest, yet another case of a purely local trial. Far from being akin to the conviction for the murder of George Floyd. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 20:46, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Alsoriano97 If "international impact" was required for postings, very little would be posted. 331dot (talk) 20:47, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, but it should be much more decisive when it comes to court rulings than in other cases (sports, science, elections...). If the follow-up of a trial has a very low international coverage/interest, will you tell me that it's not an important requirement to take into account when determining whether a court case is blurb-worthy or not? So many people are condemned every day in this world... _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 20:58, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Respectfully, we aren't talking about someone convicted of robbing the corner store, but a black man who was murdered basically for being in the wrong neighborhood in a part of the United States where convictions for this sort of thing are rare. And as I said, this incident has influenced changes in laws. 331dot (talk) 21:55, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support. This was a highly followed trial in the US, and even before the verdict this incident resulted in changes in Georgia law(the elimination of citizens' arrests). 331dot (talk) 20:52, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Article is also of decent quality from what I can see. 331dot (talk) 20:57, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support -- this verdict is likely to influence future trials of this type in the United States, and it is an historic decision in an area of the country known for its virulent racism. I doubt a jury would have reached this verdict in that area even 20 years ago. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 21:47, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support High profile case with notable legal impact, quality article. SpencerT•C 21:55, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support.

Whilst? – Sca (talk) 19:58, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose for now. Article is not developed enough to be ready for the main page. If that is fixed, it can be posted. Also, none of the blurbs link the article. That will need to be fixed. --Jayron32 20:04, 24 November 2021 (UTC) fixed now Llewee (talk) 21:01, 24 November 2021 (UTC) (Removed) Ongoing removal: 2021 Belarus–European Union border crisis[edit] Article: 2021 Belarus–European Union border crisis (talk · history · tag) Ongoing item removal (Post) Nominator's comments: The article has not has any significant updates for a week, and thus fails the ongoing criteria: In order to be posted to ongoing, the article needs to be regularly updated with new, pertinent information. If there have been significant updates in the last week, these should be added, but right now, this article fails the ongoing criteria. In particular, the last significant update is older than the day of the oldest ITN event (21 November), which is a general rule for something not being updated enough for Ongoing. Joseph2302 (talk) 12:26, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Remove. I think Belarus cleared out migrants from the border; Putin must think he made his point. 331dot (talk) 12:28, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Remove. The migrants have been moved away from the border and the situation has calmed down. No longer an ongoing event. Modest Genius talk 13:05, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – Although the situation appears to have been at least partially defused, there have been reports in recent days that in some cases Belorussian guards have continued to help migrants breach the border into Polish territory. [1], [2] [3] – Sca (talk) 13:27, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Remove the existence of news coverage that Sca notes is a necessary but not sufficient condition for maintaining an ongoing link. The article also needs to have been continuously updated. That clearly didn't happen here. --Jayron32 20:06, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – I have read the reports mentioned by Sca. It appears as if the situation have slowed down, but not ended. So still Ongoing.BabbaQ (talk) 20:23, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Removed.

(Post) Alternative blurb: ?Following the resignation of Stefan Löfven, Magdalena Andersson (pictured) is elected by the Riksdag as the first female Prime Minister of Sweden. Alternative blurb II: ?Magdalena Andersson (pictured) is elected as the first female Prime Minister of Sweden. News source(s): BBC Credits: Nominated by BastianMAT (talk · give credit) Article updated The nominated event is listed on WP:ITN/R, so each occurrence is presumed to be important enough to post. Comments should focus on whether the quality of the article and update meet WP:ITNCRIT, not the significance. Nominator's comments: ITNR, as it falls under "Changes in the holder of the office which administer the executive of their respective state/government, in those countries which qualify under the criteria above, as listed at List of current heads of state and government except when that change was already posted as part of a general election". First female prime minister of Sweden. BastianMAT (talk) 09:59, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment she takes office on the 26th (according to her article). Until that point, the blurb isn't correct, as she only becomes the first female PM of Sweden on that date. Is it usual to post when it's announced, or when they take office? Joseph2302 (talk) 10:04, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Usually when they are elected but yeah with the blurb of being elected. BastianMAT (talk) 10:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support - First female PM in Sweden. But change blurb to ”is elected” instead becomes.BabbaQ (talk) 10:06, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Yes. BastianMAT (talk) 10:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support Significant as new PM and first female. Perhaps the blub should be "elected by the Riksdag" since she didn't gain office through a normal election (by the people). cart-Talk 10:15, 24 November 2021 (UTC) That's normal in a parliamentary system. – Sca (talk) 15:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment The blurb should probably start with "Following the resignation of Stefan Löfven, ..." to provide context, since this was not an election outcome but a government reshuffle. --Tone 10:20, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support now the blurb has been changed to "is elected" seems fine to run now. Agree with Tone that we should make it clearer that this wasn't an election that caused this. Joseph2302 (talk) 11:01, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support Her article looks great, is ITNR and altblurb, although somewhat long, it's the most complete and clear of all. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 11:31, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Posting. --Tone 11:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Would suggest that we use the image of Andersson at the front page.BabbaQ (talk) 11:49, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Agree with this, we usually use the image for the newest blurb. Joseph2302 (talk) 14:32, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Post-posting support This is historic. -TenorTwelve (talk) 14:30, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Since Sweden's in the EU, perhaps she'll become the next Merkel. – Sca (talk) 15:25, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Then again, maybe not. – Sca (talk) 20:01, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Update by the nominator Things are looking bad for her and her party now. The Center Party (liberal) voted for the opposition’s budget and it got through. The Center party did not agree with the goverment’s budget, stating it was way too left. That would mean Magdallena now has to rule with right wing economic politics, which she accepted. However their junior party the Green party did not accept it and have left the goverment meaning a new Riksdag election for the prime minister post shall be held. Interesting development. SVT BastianMAT (talk) 16:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Update 2 by nominator Magdallena Andersson has officially resigned. We might have to pull the news back as she won’t be assuming office. She will only assume office if she wins a new prime minister vote, which might take place in a few days/weeks, depending on how the talks with the speaker goes. SVT BastianMAT (talk) 16:46, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Pull (or update the blurb). Her resignation is quickly making international news. 142.182.136.105 (talk) 17:38, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Update blurb Move over Kim Campbell, there's a new sheriff in town. Or more precisely, there was one for a few hours.Scaramouche33 (talk) 17:58, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Pull until it's confirmed whether she will now be the leader or not. Joseph2302 (talk) 18:01, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose pull What is ITNR is that a few hours ago she has been elected by the Swedish parliament. However much she has resigned. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 18:20, 24 November 2021 (UTC) What updating with "and immediately resigns" or something? This is a really weird sequence of events. --Tone 18:21, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Pull - The blurb, as it currently stands, is false.--WaltCip-(talk) 18:50, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Updated to Magdalena Andersson (pictured), shortly after being elected as the first female prime minister of Sweden, resigns. Any further changes, please? --PFHLai (talk) 19:13, 24 November 2021 (UTC) I think this is fine now. --Tone 19:25, 24 November 2021 (UTC) I'm not a big fan of blurbs that contemplate the resignation of a prime minister...But knowing a bit of precedent, it's very likely that in a few days/weeks she will be re-elected, as happened with Löfven in the middle of this year. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 19:48, 24 November 2021 (UTC) For the record, I support this new blurb. It will work until she is finally elected the new PM in a few days or at the longest a week.BabbaQ (talk) 20:21, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks. Hopefully, we'll have an update about her taking office soon. That would be a simple update to do. --PFHLai (talk) 20:31, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Pull -- wait until she actually is seated. She just resigned. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 21:22, 24 November 2021 (UTC) The blurb already says that. It's fine. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 21:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) It's probably just my own bias here; but it seems silly to post this when she just resigned. Forming coalition governments in a parliamentary system is weird. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 21:45, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART)[edit] Article: Double Asteroid Redirection Test (talk · history · tag) Blurb: ?NASA launches DART – the first attempt to change the course of an asteroid (pictured) (Post) Alternative blurb: ?The Double Asteroid Redirection Test spacecraft is launched on a mission to the asteroid Didymos and its moon Dimorphos (artist's impression pictured) Alternative blurb II: ?The Double Asteroid Redirection Test spacecraft is launched on a mission to attempt to deflect the course of the asteroid Dimorphos (artist's impression pictured) News source(s): BBC, Guardian, NYT Credits: Nominated by Andrew Davidson (talk · give credit) Created by Frmorrison (talk · give credit) Updated by CRS-20 (talk · give credit) Article updated Nominator's comments: There's going to be a follow-up launching in 2024 and arriving in 2027 so it's quite a long-term plan. But it's in the news now. Andrew?(talk) 08:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support important mission with global implications, good article. Polyamorph (talk) 08:18, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment. This may be notable as the first mission of its type (to post now); it will be ITNR when it arrives as well. Just saying. 331dot (talk) 08:19, 24 November 2021 (UTC) This may be ITN/R per "first ... launches of any type of rocket" as it's the first mission to use the NEXT drive but that's debatable. Andrew?(talk) 10:09, 24 November 2021 (UTC) The NEXT is the thruster on the spacecraft, not the rocket that put it up there(a Falcon 9). 331dot (talk) 12:31, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Such missions usually have multiple stages and each stage has separate rocket engines. The first stage is usually more spectacular but there's no scientific reason to prefer it. For deep space missions lasting years, the efficiency of the final spacecraft will be most important and this is a new design. Andrew?(talk) 12:54, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support important global mission (even if it does sound like DART is copying the plot of Salvation (TV series)). Added 3 cn tags to article, but apart from that, it looks more than good enough article quality for the front page. Joseph2302 (talk) 09:13, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support Everyone in the world should be happy we'll finally have a way to stop any doomsday asteroids from wiping us all out. Dream Focus 11:15, 24 November 2021 (UTC) If it works, of course... _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 11:39, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support is ITNR from what Andrew says and the global impact of this mission is undoubted, so it's clearly notable. In fact I think it should be one of the most important scientific news of the year. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 11:39, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Global impact?? I thought the idea was to avoid that! Martinevans123 (talk) 13:52, 24 November 2021 (UTC) This event can't be notable, its only impact is on a small unpopulated asteroid! WaltCip-(talk) 14:17, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Impactfulness nonapparent at this pt. in time & space. – Sca (talk) 15:00, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment the proposed blurb is a mess. I've added alt1, though for some reason that's messing up the template formatting - I can't work out why. Modest Genius talk 13:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Also, this is not ITNR, as it's not a new type of rocket and interplanetary probes are ITNR when they arrive at their destination, not when launched. But the gap here is long enough (ten months) that it's reasonable to post both launch and arrival. Modest Genius talk 13:15, 24 November 2021 (UTC) @Modest Genius: I fixed the formatting issue. Adding italics to either of the blurbs breaks it, because italics are already applied by default.--WaltCip-(talk) 13:26, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks. Modest Genius talk 13:44, 24 November 2021 (UTC) The fact that the mission is attempting to alter the course of the asteroid makes this particularly notable. Added alt2. Polyamorph (talk) 13:40, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Alt2 is incorrect. It won't 'deflect the course' of the asteroid. The impact will modify orbit of the moon around the asteroid, not either of their orbits around the Sun. Modest Genius talk 13:44, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Dimorphos is an asteroid (albeit a minor one compared to Didymos). It will deflect its course. Nothing to do with the Sun. Polyamorph (talk) 13:46, 24 November 2021 (UTC) It may deflect its course. – Sca (talk) 15:06, 24 November 2021 (UTC) It will deflect it, even if by only a negligible amount. But this is covered by the wording of alt2 "on a mission to attempt to deflect the course". Polyamorph (talk) 15:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – From what I've seen, this is such a complicated, long-term project that any significant results may be years off. – Sca (talk) 13:30, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose - no mention of Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck or Michael Bay. But seriously Support, though I'd recommend that gallery be trimmed down. --Masem (t) 15:03, 24 November 2021 (UTC) You forgot to mention Taylor Swift. – Sca (talk) 15:07, 24 November 2021 (UTC) @Sca: You mean Liv Tyler :) Brandmeistertalk 20:05, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support ALT2 Very significant, and definitely should be in ITN.

The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 10:35, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Over a million people die on the roads every year – that's over 3,000 every day.

Joseph2302 (talk) 08:35, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Not terrorism, according to "sources", so whilst tragic, it appears to be a worse-than-usual crime gone wrong. Black Kite (talk) 08:44, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support -- It seems that around five people died in the attack. The perpetrator has been reported by a few media outlets as Daniel Brooks, a black man who raps under the name "MathboiFly" and has tons of social media posts supporting BLM, and this was in the aftermath of a very notable event where Rittenhouse was cleared as killing two black men in self-defence. OldPeace7068 (talk) 09:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Complete extrapolation. Police have said they believe he was on the run having committed a separate crime, nothing to do with Rittenhouse at all. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 09:35, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Wikipedia is there to report the facts. Police and many members of the public initially considered the possibility of Islamic terrorism due to similar incidents in the past involving Muslims, the targeting of a western festival, and the recent rise in Islamic terrorist activity, but police have now confirmed that this is not terrorism related. Similarly, there have been widespread links/controversy made between the rapper and his connections to BLM, and it has been linked to Rittenhouse whether you like it or not. It is part of the story. The killer is a major supporter and activist of BLM. And this happened in the aftermath of Rittenhouse's acquittal. It's all part of the background and developing story. OldPeace7068 (talk) 09:45, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Not at all. The police have stated he was fleeing a separate scene. Conflating this with BLM/Rittenhouse is pure crystal balling. Thanks. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 09:47, 22 November 2021 (UTC) "two black men" and you'd think we were on a website about facts... CharredWaffle (talk) 14:04, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. Calling this an "attack" may be a misnomer as it appears that the suspect was fleeing the police, not that it was a preplanned attack or terrorism. 331dot (talk) 12:50, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Maybe so. OTOH, at least one report quotes a witness as saying the vehicle seemed to be "targeting people" as it veered from side to side. Also, reports say it crashed through barriers to reach the parade, which seems to indicate that it was indeed an attack, though possibly not a pre-planned one. – Sca (talk) 16:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment The blurb should (and currently does not) mention the country in which this event took place. Chrisclear (talk) 12:56, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose - It's not at all clear that this is an act of terrorism, and thus not something that would be imminently notable.--WaltCip-(talk) 13:09, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose both on merit and article quality. As of this comment, the incident does not appear to have been a deliberate attack. I would be open to reconsideration if contrary information comes to light. Also, at present the article is little more than an oversized stub. It's not ready for the main page. -Ad Orientem (talk) 13:13, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support ... pending expansion of article, which presently comprises a mere 250 words, i.e. a stub.

ArsenalGhanaPartey (talk) 15:31, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment If the incident turns out not to be terrorist motivated, I honestly don't see it in Main Page, and if it's , with five dead, I 'mnot very clear, although the number of injured is dantesque. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 15:51, 22 November 2021 (UTC) If this is confirmed as an unfortunate series of events with no purposeful motivating factor (driver escaping from knife fight and inadvertently ran through parade crowd), then I would agree this is not really something that should be posted. This doesn't mean motiveless events can't ever be posted but I would expect the results to be more devasting (like the various major building fires or collapses that we had). --Masem (t) 16:36, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Exactly, I think the same Masem. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 17:30, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Wait – As an AP update seems to suggest this was the act of a lone nutcase with a record, I've withdrawn my provisonal support. However, it seems we're still in a wait situation, since nine of the injured are listed in critical condition. If the toll were to rise to double digits, we might still want to consider a blurb about this very nasty event. – Sca (talk) 18:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support if the motivation turns out to be terrorism, neutral if otherwise. Mlb96 (talk) 19:04, 22 November 2021 (UTC) A post – by an IT user with no other contributions – on our article's talk page posits racial motivation.

The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 19:11, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Please see expanded comment above. Thanks. – Sca (talk) 19:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support. This event is in the news and the article looks to be in good shape. -- Tavix (talk) 19:38, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: – Since perp's been ID'd & police say he'll face five counts of first-degree intentional homicide, this is looking potentially more significant. – Sca (talk) 20:02, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Per The Independent this guy had a domestic dispute, and drove his car like a lunatic. Not terror-related, just an idiot behind the wheel. Not significant, tragic, but will never make the top 1000 things that happened on Planet Earth in 2021, let alone the top 250. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support - a mass-casualty event, receiving international coverage (e.g., BBC), a suspect is being charged, and the article has been improved to sufficient quality. Levivich 20:04, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support - rare (even in the US) mass-casualty event. Article quality is decent. Destroyeraa (Alternate account) 20:28, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment a road traffic accident in the US is not rare. Mass-casualty events in the US are far from rare. It's pretty obvious that giving this tragic yet non-terrorist/non-BLM/non-protest/non-deliberate accident undue prominence is not what the encyclopedia was designed to do. Of course, you can dig into the BBC website and find coverage, it's all "shock and think of the children" in the US, but the rest of the world has moved on the moment it was clear it was a sad instance of a crime somewhere else having shitty side-effects, and literally nothing more. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) The last time I remember a similar incident happened in the US was late 2017 when somebody plowed into a crowd in Virginia after a violent demonstration got broken up. We posted the event that it was tangentially related to, largely on the strength of somebody plowing their car into a crowd and killing someone. You supported posting it. Rockphed (talk) 01:03, 23 November 2021 (UTC) If you're referring to Charlottesville car attack, that was about a man deliberately setting out to ram people. This is about a man trying to escape the scene of a domestic incident and getting into a road traffic accident. The two are incomparable. But good try. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 08:07, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Agreeing with previous posters, posting this event would seem to be giving undue weight to a tragic traffic accident. Comparison with the Charlottesville incident from several years back is unfair, given the explicitly political motivations of the earlier event. Wizardoftheyear (talk) 01:17, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Neutral and Wait Yes, with the additional details that have come to light, this is literally a domestic issue that had decidedly more tragic consequences. However, that is additional details. The initial response, and the fact there were several fatalities during a celebration, caught on camera and shared around the world before anyone knew what was going on, has made this major news and a source of intrigue. I think we need to wait to see if the news stations drop their coverage now that there is less intrigue and crisis; if it has effectively left the news cycle by end of day, take this as an oppose, but if it is still on the news banners, take this as support. Kingsif (talk) 01:42, 23 November 2021 (UTC) 4 of the 12 paragraphs in this article start "On November 2X". Typical anti-American bias from the Brits (which is far from rare) notwithstanding, the quality is not there yet. GreatCaesarsGhost 02:23, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Support - Tragic, criminally-induced mass-casualty. Significant details are now known.

This at first got attention because it might have been terrorism related, no problem there. But all we are left with now is an accident which leaves 5 death: while tragic, this is sadly an everyday occurrence. We have e.g. this week a ferry accident in Sri Lanka (at least 6 death)[5], 7 death in Greece when migrants flee the police[6], 22 deaths on Lake Kivu[7], nine deaths in a fire in Bulgaria[8], 10 deaths in China after a car crash[9], ... I see no reason to post this, as it is not exceptional, has no lasting importance, and isn't even very interesting (without the terrorism angle). It's a sad tragedy, but a very common one. Fram (talk) 17:03, 23 November 2021 (UTC) I think it is WP:TOOSOON to make a determination as to whether this was an act of terror or not. Terrorism or not, the ramming appears to be deliberate, and it has made national and international headlines. Aasim (talk) 06:53, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose.

Major election in an EU member state. – Illegitimate Barrister (talk • contribs), 02:46, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Question Do we post presidential elections even if the president has mostly symbolic roles? Scaramouche33 (talk) 07:32, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, heads of state elections are posted even if they are ceremonial/wield little power, it mostly depends on the article quality itself which should be more than sufficient. Two examples are the Italian presidental election and Czech presidental election, both having similar powers to the Bulgarian one. [10] [11] BastianMAT (talk) 09:02, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Weak support this article has been on front page for a week already, but I guess the second round presidency vote means that it's ITN eligible again. Article looks to have been sufficiently updated about the presidential second round vote. Joseph2302 (talk) 12:10, 22 November 2021 (UTC) This is not ITNR. We no longer post all elections for head of state- we post the election/choosing of the official with actual executive power, according to List of current heads of state and government; in Bulgaria that is the PM, not the president. 331dot (talk) 12:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) In which case, I oppose this nomination, and it shouldn't have been tagged as ITNR. Joseph2302 (talk) 12:37, 22 November 2021 (UTC) In fairness, it is a recent change that not everyone may be aware of. 331dot (talk) 12:41, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Alright, I thought going by older posts that head of state elections are still part of ITNR but if its been removed, no problem and thanks for the headsup for future nominations. BastianMAT (talk) 12:46, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I just saw this now. I must have missed the change or forgot about it. So my comment on other presidents is not relevant here. --Tone 17:49, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Exactly, that’s what got me confused to when I ITNR nominated this. In the past as you and I mentioned, similar head of state elections (with similar powers) such as Moldova(November 2020), Germany, Austria, Italy, Czech Republic have been posted. 331dot said the removal of ceremonial head of state elections from ITNR were ’recently’ done, so the change must have not been too long ago for us to not know that.BastianMAT (talk) 18:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Blurb on MainPage was updated and moved up --PFHLai (talk) 13:11, 22 November 2021 (UTC) PFHLai there wasn't consensus to do this update- the presidential election is not ITNR, and there was not consensus here that it's important enough for ITN. We should leave it where it is, so it can roll off soon, instead of moving it up so it'll stay on ITN for another week... Joseph2302 (talk) 13:27, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Post posting support If the election was stand-alone, we would probably post it. This is just the case where the general election were held together with the first round of presidential, so there is a single article. I don't see a problem. --Tone 14:56, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I doubt we would post this as a standalone item. He may be head of state, but he has no power. It's the Prime Minister of Bulgaria who would be posted automatically.  — Amakuru (talk) 17:18, 22 November 2021 (UTC) In fact he has been in de facto power since the 2021 April elections as he appointed his friend as acting prime minister. The de jure power he wields is similar to those in Italy and Czech Republic, where he gets to nominate the prime minister and supreme court judges, he can veto laws (although parliament can override) and he of course serves as head of state, don’t forget Bulgaria even has a vice president. In the past we have posted the Italian presidental and Czech Republic presidental elections, both are parliamantary republics too. I thought it was ITNR, but 331dot mentioned that head of state elections (where the head of state is not head of goverment) was recently removed from ITNR. Italian presidental election posted Czech Republic presidental election posted BastianMAT (talk) 17:32, 22 November 2021 (UTC) (ec) As far as I remember we post both if the articles are ok. We've posted presidents of Austria and Germany, which have a similar role, for example. Furthermore, the president of Germany is elected by Bundestag, not by a popular vote. --Tone 17:36, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Pull update and Revert back to previous version per Joseph2302. This guy is just a figure head, and we already posted the main election result. There was no reason to have bumped this up, and the result is not ITN/R so needs consensus, which it doesn't have.  — Amakuru (talk) 17:14, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Pull update and agree with above, not seeing consensus here for this to have even been posted in the first instance. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 17:21, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Beyond the issue of whether it should be on the main page, the blurb is clumsy. "In Bulgaria," is redundant. Where else but in Bulgaria would you be elected President of Bulgaria? Schwede66 17:57, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Restored old blurb. --PFHLai (talk) 18:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose pull Not a head of state change but in the same spirit This post was made by orbitalbuzzsaw gang (talk) 19:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment I think we need some kind of page break to restart voting. A lot of the opposition above was to the unilateral action and not the nom itself. as for me, Oppose while there are some states with significant power invested in the secondary office, this is not one of them. GreatCaesarsGhost 21:55, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I didn't particularly mind about the unilateral action myself - it was made in good faith - and my oppose is purely on the merits of the case, for much the same reasons as you.

The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 23:23, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Not that it matters to this nomination, but Rittenhouse's victims were white. GreatCaesarsGhost 00:04, 20 November 2021 (UTC) *cough cough* Rittenhouse's victims were white *cough cough* – John M Wolfson (talk • contribs) 00:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Who said he wasn't talking about Young Dolph's routine assassin? We don't know he wasn't white. We don't know if he had other black American victims. Memphis is all about unsolved mysteries! AGF. InedibleHulk (talk) 02:06, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose on quality The article needs a lot of work, as there are multiple sections with no inline citations.Pawnkingthree (talk) 23:42, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support While this might be unduly implicative of the Chinese state being connected, if RSs are making that connection this definitely belongs. – John M Wolfson (talk • contribs) 00:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose on quality I would support this if the article has some ref work done. There's sections that are unsourced. --TDKR Chicago 101 (talk) 00:34, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose this is newsworthy for sure but blurbing that someone "disappeared" after making an accusation seems like a WP:BLPCRIME issue to me. --LaserLegs (talk) 00:39, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Completely agree it's an awkward thing to summarise in a way that fits BLP while keeping it clear why the event is notable, I'd welcome suggestions for alternative phrasing. I realise this is a fairly limited action, but for that reason I deliberately didn't link to the person she accused in the proposed blurb. Blythwood (talk) 01:57, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose as per LaserLegs, there's something wrong about posting speculation that someone disappeared straight after they made accusations. With little reliable information, this seems like a BLP issue to post it. Joseph2302 (talk) 01:47, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Far too speculative, with overtones of anti-China sentiment, and with too many unknowns. Needs far more clarification before it is posted. And a guarantee that ITN will publish a full We Were Wrong! statement and retraction on the Main page when it is found out she has just eloped with her boyfriend or girlfriend, as the case may be. HiLo48 (talk) 01:55, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Clearly if China "disappeared" her, that would be a story, but this appears to be Western nations making a demand of China and there's no hard evidence she has been killed or imprisoned or the like. We don't post this type of speculative stories. --Masem (t) 02:16, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support Per wide coverage in RSes. Normchou?? 03:22, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose unless the incident has a separate article. Sun8908?Talk 07:38, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support — article looks decent enough for ITN standards by my eye, wide coverage in RSes. If the choice of "disappears" is undesirable, then "is reported missing" might be a potential alternative (posted as altblurb). [osunpokeh/talk/contributions] 08:41, 20 November 2021 (UTC) I think that suggests she was reported missing in the police report sense, not that Novak Djokovic described her as "a missing person" to reporters. Not a bad idea. Just a bit ambiguous. InedibleHulk (talk) 09:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Strong support, in the news, top page news in many countries. The issue is she has suddenly disappeared after accusing a senior cabinet minister of a serious crime, and the involved parties are public figures indept of this incident, so there is nothing wrong as long as it is sourced and not stated as truth. Peng's disappearance and the resulting sports diplomacy pressure and boycott threats are sufficient Bumbubookworm (talk) 12:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Have you ever studied the difference between correlation and causation? HiLo48 (talk) 21:48, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Yes I have and I wonder if it's possible to have a maths competition over Wikipedia lol. I never said there was a causation, although I am sure many on Wikipedia have noted your hard-left POV eg trying to get all right of centre Australian newspapers struck off at RSN. Bumbubookworm (talk) 22:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Applause.

Something that may have happened isn't blurbworthy, no matter how widely it's hyped. – Sca (talk) 13:05, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose per Masem, Sca.

Polyamorph (talk) 20:03, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support per above. The article has unref'd sections about her tennis career, but the linked section is ready. Davey2116 (talk) 21:52, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. We shouldn't (and don't) post articles with multiple unsourced sections. The fact that the section linked in bold is referenced is irrelevant. Black Kite (talk) 23:26, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Wait Let's wait until we are 100% sure what has happened to her. Heythereimaguy (talk) 23:53, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Global Times continues to point to her, this time at a restaurant with a coach and friends, seemingly quite visible. Western speculation now turns to whether she's safe, though, or free from external interference or to be believed. All very personal and hard-to-answer questions, for anybody anywhere. InedibleHulk (talk) 00:10, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose it's just one person in a world where much worse things happen in other places like Ethiopia. Banedon (talk) 01:11, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose for now. Videos of Peng Shuai have supposedly surfaced. Nice4What (talk · contribs) – (Thanks ?) 03:30, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Support However, I propose removing the term 'Chinese' in front of Peng Shuai. It does not add to her character or her identity as a professional tennis player. Something along the lines of "Professional tennis player Peng Shuai disappears after accusing former Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli of sexual assault." would be better imo. However, we should also note the videos posted by Global Times editors (primarily those tweeted by editor-in-chief Hu Xijin) and their aftermath. JMonkey2006 (talk) 11:10, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – She's reappeared, online at least. End of story? – Sca (talk) 13:34, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Strong support Wide coverage by RSes and notable. Fakescientist8000 (talk) 14:05, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Still too murky and speculative, with little general impact. – Sca (talk) 15:24, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Leaving aside anything else, there is video evidence of her out and about so she hasn't been "disappeared" and isn't "missing". Whether or not something else is happening is in the realm of speculation, and would require a separate blurb. Also, very large swathes of the article on her career lack even a single citation.

This applies to a high percentage of the content we post and is unproductive." "International notability" is not a criteria for posting at ITN, nor has it ever been. --Jayron32 19:05, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Well my direct opinion is that it is not notable. My reasoning is the discussion that already took place on the 2021 talk page. I also have previous discussions months ago where things highly notable to one country aren’t included. Elijahandskip (talk) 19:11, 19 November 2021 (UTC) This is not a discussion of the page 2021. The criteria established for other parts of Wikipedia don't apply here. If you wish to change the criteria used for the ITN box, then start a discussion at WT:ITN. Votes without valid rationales are given little weight. It's fine if you have a useful rationale, but merely "I don't think it's notable enough" does not provide any useful guidance to admins when deciding consensus. I mean, you're allowed to say any silly thing you want, I suppose, but you can't expect anyone to take you seriously if it isn't valid. --Jayron32 19:18, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Well since you don’t like my reasoning, just let me say “no”. People have supported ITN’s in the past without giving a reason, so my “Oppose” in this case will not have a reason. Elijahandskip (talk) 19:22, 19 November 2021 (UTC) As I said, it's a free world. People do nonsensical things all of the time. --Jayron32 19:24, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Yep, I couldn’t agree more. In reality, my oppose on this comes more to combat American Wikipedia vs English Wikipedia. There is a essay on Wikipedia that I recently read that has that meaning. Not everything that happens in America is notable for Wikipedia/2021/ITN/Portal Current Events, etc….Elijahandskip (talk) 19:34, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose (at least on news of just the verdict). It was a highly watched case in the U.S., but it was clear early on to many legal experts that are crying foul on judicial behavior. It is very very likely to see an appeal and so this is not the end. This is not like the result from the very public George Floyd protests (which we posted and had ongoing about those, and the verdict). That said, there had been concerns there may be rioting following an acquittal , and while I'm not seeing any immediate news on that, a major riot (akin to the LA riots after King's verdict) would likely be the newsworthy factor here. --Masem (t) 19:05, 19 November 2021 (UTC) There literally cannot be any appeal of a not guilty verdict. This is a core principle of how double jeopardy is handled in American jurisprudence. A not guilty jury verdict is basically always final. See [12]. There are some exceedingly rare exceptions to this, but none of them would apply in this case. An ordinary jury verdict of "not guilty" like this one (even in a controversial trial) is treated as basically sacrosanct, and there can be no appeals by the government. --Jayron32 19:08, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Except for the calls for a mistrial that are being entered now. I know there's complexities with double jeopardy there, but that's still on the books and that itself can be a legal process. --Masem (t) 19:15, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Um, what? There were calls for a mistrial by Rittenhouse's defense team prior to the jury verdict coming back. Now that the verdict is in their client's favor, I doubt highly they will press forward with these requests. Indeed, articles such as this one note "The verdict also meant that Judge Bruce Schroeder did not have to rule on the defense's motions for a mistrial." --Jayron32 19:23, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose as above. If we had to have an American court psychodrama today, the better option from a world-historical perspective would probably be the acquittal of the purported killers of Malcolm X. —Brigade Piron (talk) 19:20, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose AGF, but this is such a small story in the grand scheme. GreatCaesarsGhost 19:23, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Wait. It is too early to tell what impact this will have. It could be a Rodney King-like result where acquittal of the accused leads to broad social unrest, or it could pass with a shrug. I expect that we will know within 24 hours.

I wonder if we should put this blurb up now, or when Parliament repeals them and the farmers go home (don't have strong opinions either way, but I lean towards waiting). If we're going to put it up now, I've uploaded this screengrab of Modi's announcement from his CC-BY YouTube channel; we could use it. Btw Indefensible - Dracophyllum was the only updater, not DiplomatTesterMan. Kind regards, W. Tell DCCXLVI (talk to me!/c) 07:05, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Using the update to put back in ongoing instead of a final blurb would be fine too if preferable. And DiplomatTesterMan did more updates on the article before that, he still deserves some credit too I think. - Indefensible (talk) 07:12, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose because the article is not sufficiently updated. There is currently a 1 sentence mention in the lead of the repeal of the laws, and no mention of it, nor of any follow-on protests, anywhere in the body of the article. Before this can be posted, the latest developments would need to be added to the article appropriately. --Jayron32 12:18, 19 November 2021 (UTC) @Jayron32 Have you read the repeal section? Dracophyllum 20:10, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Your response is 8 hours after Jayron32's, Dracophyllum. The section may have not existed when Jayron commented. But then again, I am not going to take the time to check if it did exist at 12:18 PM UTC on 19 Nov 2021. Tube·of·Light 02:30, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: The announcement by itself has no legal value. Parliament has to repeal the laws, which it will probably do in the coming Winter Session. Also some farmer's unions are continuing protests until the laws are repealed and minimum support prices reconsidered. So it might be better to wait, but no strong opinion either way. --Jose Mathew (talk) 12:24, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Wait and see what the impact of this is.

In fact, we do post many India-centric stories here, this one having festered in ongoing for nearly a year. --LaserLegs (talk) 23:36, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support. Invariably it is announcements that get more attention than the actual act, most of the time(we post elections when the result is known, not when the results are official/certified). If Modi renegs, that will likely be newsworthy itself. 331dot (talk) 23:16, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Weak oppose - as Wilhelm Tell DCCXLVI says, the BKU is still protesting. I would prefer waiting till the laws are actually repealed (and FWIW, these laws are being repealed just before the 2022 Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly elections and elections in some other states, which are crucial for Modi's political party). Tube·of·Light 02:30, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – On article quality – and as others have noted because the laws haven't taken effect.

And of course, there will be no "permanent cancellation of The Boat Race", that's total bollocks, but perhaps inline with your regular contributions. As you perhaps should know already, The Boat Race 2022 is scheduled for next year, and if COVID stymies it, one imagines it will simply be moved to the River Great Ouse once again. I'm unclear as to where you think that a lunar eclipse would be a portent for the permanent cancellation of an event which has been conducted since 1829, even before the Third Reich failed to play nicely. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 17:56, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Ease up, Ramblo, it was a joke. (And BTW, the Third Reich and this topic are entirely unrelated.) – Sca (talk) 18:26, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Yeah, and this topic and the Boat Race are completely unrelated. And it wasn't funny in any sense. So explain yourself. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 18:45, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support, this lunar eclipse has gotten significant news coverage.

The assassination itself, of course, would have been ITN-worthy, as would the convictions of the accused. To me, this is on the same level. BD2412 T 21:30, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Just remembered it won't make DYK as much of the content was copy/pasted from the main article, and it's not 5x from that. ITN it is! – Muboshgu (talk) 21:36, 17 November 2021 (UTC) It was also created nine months ago so any expansion at that time is far too old; you could conceivably get it through DYK if it passes as a Good Article though. ??????? ? 21:43, 17 November 2021 (UTC) It was just moved to mainspace. – Muboshgu (talk) 23:34, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Not only would this by DYK material, it's not even eligible per Muboshgu.

The two who are being exonerated are not independently notable and were released decades ago, so the actual impact is minimal.

The history books are not often changed in such a manner. 331dot (talk) 14:35, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Those two examples were incomparably more significant, as both victims were heads of state. – Sca (talk) 15:24, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Malcolm X was not a head of state but he was highly influential in the cause of civil rights. The point is that history is not often corrected as it was here. 331dot (talk) 16:53, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – per Modest Genius.

Joseph2302 (talk) 20:40, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: Perhaps the blurb can mention the evacuation of thousands of residents and the destruction of infrastructure. Power outage and a small death toll won't cut it. --PFHLai (talk) 22:35, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Comment - this is quite a significant event in Canada, with reports that it could become the most expensive natural disaster in Canadian history [16], the death toll is expected to rise, along with wide ranging effects on supply chains and transportation networks. If I recall correctly, I think we did post the 2013 Alberta floods, for precedent. Connormah (talk) 22:39, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I guess "could be" is key here. If it does become the most expensive natural disaster after electing Trudeau in the history of Canada, then it's well placed for a blurb. Maybe now is premature. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:42, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Wait Living through this, it's a pretty devastating disaster, with all road access cut off to and from the Port of Vancouver, which is having a major impact on supply chains across Western Canada. But I don't think this meets the standard previously set for ITN just yet, although there are reports that the death toll is expected to rise. There's also reports of an imminent dike breach into a large city. As such, I'd suggest that we wait. NorthernFalcon (talk) 22:51, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – Lots of damage & dislocation but so far only one fatal. – Sca (talk) 23:29, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Wait If this gets worse and deadlier, then I will support. Heythereimaguy (talk) 13:02, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Wait per NorthernFalcon & Sca. Modest Genius talk 13:16, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Comment I would further comment that given Port of Vancouver is affected (the fourth largest port in North America by volume of goods) the supply chain issues are pretty notable. [17] CaffeinAddict (talk) 23:11, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, just “affected” the fourth in North America. Not America. Not even in the world. Let's not overestimate it. Storms are storms, and it happen...a lot of things. International impact is very low. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 01:52, 21 November 2021 (UTC) The discussion above is closed. Please do not modify it.

Please read the guidelines. Admin instructions are here. ??Skip to suggestions In the news toolbox Error reports Nominations (Archives) Discussion General criteria Death criteria Recurring items Admin guide Image protection Current events portal v t e Shortcut WP:ITN/C This page provides a forum for editors to suggest items for inclusion on In the news (ITN), a protected template on the Main Page, as well as the forum for discussion of candidates. This is not the page to report errors in the ITN section on the Main Page—please go to the appropriate section at WP:ERRORS. Archives of past nominations can be found here. This candidates page is integrated with the daily pages of Portal:Current events. Under each daily section header below is the transcluded Portal:Current events items for that day (with a light green header). Each day's portal page is followed by a subsection for suggestions and discussion. A blurb is a one sentence summary of the news story. An alternate suggestion for the blurb is called an altblurb, and any more suggestions get labelled alt1, alt2, etc. A blurb needs at least one target article, highlighted in bold; reviewers check the quality of that article and whether it is updated, and whether reliable sources demonstrate the significance of the event. Other articles can also be linked. The Ongoing line is for regularly updated articles which cover events that remain in the news over a longer period of time. RD stands for the "recent deaths" line, and can include any living thing whose death was recently announced. In some cases, recent deaths may need additional explanation as provided by a blurb; this is decided by consensus.

Find the correct section below for the date of the event (not the date nominated). Do not add sections for new dates. These are automatically generated (at midnight UTC) by a bot; creating them manually breaks this process. Nominate the blurb for ITN inclusion under the "Suggestions" subheading for the date, emboldening the link in the blurb to the updated article. Use a level 4 header (====) when doing so. Preferably use the template {{ITN candidate}} to nominate the article related to the event in the news. Make sure that you include a reference from a verifiable, reliable secondary source. Press releases are not acceptable. The suggested blurb should be written in simple present tense. Adding an explanation why the event should be posted greatly increases the odds of posting. Please consider alerting editors to the nomination by adding the template {{ITN note}} to the corresponding article's talk page. Purge this page to update the cache There are criteria which guide the decision on whether or not to put a particular item on In the news, based largely on the extensiveness of the updated content and the perceived significance of the recent developments. These are listed at WP:ITN. Submissions that do not follow the guidelines at Wikipedia:In the news will not be placed onto the live template. Headers[edit] Items that have been posted or pulled from the main page are generally marked with (Posted) or (Pulled) in the item's subject so it is clear they are no longer active. Items can also be marked as (Ready) when the article is both updated and there seems to be a consensus to post. The posting admin, however, should always judge the update and the consensus to post themselves. If you find an entry that you don't feel is ready to post is marked (Ready), you should remove the mark in the header. Voicing an opinion on an item[edit] Format your comment to contain "support" or "oppose", and include a rationale for your choice. In particular, address the notability of the event, the quality of the article, and whether it has been updated. Please do not...[edit] add simple "support!" or "oppose!" votes without including your reasons. Similarly, curt replies such as "who?", "meh", or "duh!" are usually not helpful. Instead, explain the reasons why you think the item meets or does not meet the ITN inclusion criteria so a consensus can be reached. oppose an item because the event is only relating to a single country, or failing to relate to one. This applies to a high percentage of the content we post and is unproductive. accuse other editors of supporting, opposing or nominating due to a personal bias (such as ethnocentrism).

I refer to here. Yet another case with zero international impact and interest, yet another case of a purely local trial. Far from being akin to the conviction for the murder of George Floyd. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 20:46, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Alsoriano97 If "international impact" was required for postings, very little would be posted. 331dot (talk) 20:47, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, but it should be much more decisive when it comes to court rulings than in other cases (sports, science, elections...). If the follow-up of a trial has a very low international coverage/interest, will you tell me that it's not an important requirement to take into account when determining whether a court case is blurb-worthy or not? So many people are condemned every day in this world... _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 20:58, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Respectfully, we aren't talking about someone convicted of robbing the corner store, but a black man who was murdered basically for being in the wrong neighborhood in a part of the United States where convictions for this sort of thing are rare. And as I said, this incident has influenced changes in laws. 331dot (talk) 21:55, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support. This was a highly followed trial in the US, and even before the verdict this incident resulted in changes in Georgia law(the elimination of citizens' arrests). 331dot (talk) 20:52, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Article is also of decent quality from what I can see. 331dot (talk) 20:57, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support -- this verdict is likely to influence future trials of this type in the United States, and it is an historic decision in an area of the country known for its virulent racism. I doubt a jury would have reached this verdict in that area even 20 years ago. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 21:47, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support High profile case with notable legal impact, quality article. SpencerT•C 21:55, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support. This is a newsworthy verdict, and the article is in good shape from a skim-through. -- Tavix (talk) 21:56, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose people found guilty of crime. Seriously.

Whilst? – Sca (talk) 19:58, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose for now. Article is not developed enough to be ready for the main page. If that is fixed, it can be posted. Also, none of the blurbs link the article. That will need to be fixed. --Jayron32 20:04, 24 November 2021 (UTC) fixed now Llewee (talk) 21:01, 24 November 2021 (UTC) (Removed) Ongoing removal: 2021 Belarus–European Union border crisis[edit] Article: 2021 Belarus–European Union border crisis (talk · history · tag) Ongoing item removal (Post) Nominator's comments: The article has not has any significant updates for a week, and thus fails the ongoing criteria: In order to be posted to ongoing, the article needs to be regularly updated with new, pertinent information. If there have been significant updates in the last week, these should be added, but right now, this article fails the ongoing criteria. In particular, the last significant update is older than the day of the oldest ITN event (21 November), which is a general rule for something not being updated enough for Ongoing. Joseph2302 (talk) 12:26, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Remove. I think Belarus cleared out migrants from the border; Putin must think he made his point. 331dot (talk) 12:28, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Remove. The migrants have been moved away from the border and the situation has calmed down. No longer an ongoing event. Modest Genius talk 13:05, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – Although the situation appears to have been at least partially defused, there have been reports in recent days that in some cases Belorussian guards have continued to help migrants breach the border into Polish territory. [1], [2] [3] – Sca (talk) 13:27, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Remove the existence of news coverage that Sca notes is a necessary but not sufficient condition for maintaining an ongoing link. The article also needs to have been continuously updated. That clearly didn't happen here. --Jayron32 20:06, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – I have read the reports mentioned by Sca. It appears as if the situation have slowed down, but not ended. So still Ongoing.BabbaQ (talk) 20:23, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Removed.

(Post) Alternative blurb: ?Following the resignation of Stefan Löfven, Magdalena Andersson (pictured) is elected by the Riksdag as the first female Prime Minister of Sweden. Alternative blurb II: ?Magdalena Andersson (pictured) is elected as the first female Prime Minister of Sweden. News source(s): BBC Credits: Nominated by BastianMAT (talk · give credit) Article updated The nominated event is listed on WP:ITN/R, so each occurrence is presumed to be important enough to post. Comments should focus on whether the quality of the article and update meet WP:ITNCRIT, not the significance. Nominator's comments: ITNR, as it falls under "Changes in the holder of the office which administer the executive of their respective state/government, in those countries which qualify under the criteria above, as listed at List of current heads of state and government except when that change was already posted as part of a general election". First female prime minister of Sweden. BastianMAT (talk) 09:59, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment she takes office on the 26th (according to her article). Until that point, the blurb isn't correct, as she only becomes the first female PM of Sweden on that date. Is it usual to post when it's announced, or when they take office? Joseph2302 (talk) 10:04, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Usually when they are elected but yeah with the blurb of being elected. BastianMAT (talk) 10:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support - First female PM in Sweden. But change blurb to ”is elected” instead becomes.BabbaQ (talk) 10:06, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Yes. BastianMAT (talk) 10:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support Significant as new PM and first female. Perhaps the blub should be "elected by the Riksdag" since she didn't gain office through a normal election (by the people). cart-Talk 10:15, 24 November 2021 (UTC) That's normal in a parliamentary system. – Sca (talk) 15:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment The blurb should probably start with "Following the resignation of Stefan Löfven, ..." to provide context, since this was not an election outcome but a government reshuffle. --Tone 10:20, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support now the blurb has been changed to "is elected" seems fine to run now. Agree with Tone that we should make it clearer that this wasn't an election that caused this. Joseph2302 (talk) 11:01, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support Her article looks great, is ITNR and altblurb, although somewhat long, it's the most complete and clear of all. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 11:31, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Posting. --Tone 11:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Would suggest that we use the image of Andersson at the front page.BabbaQ (talk) 11:49, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Agree with this, we usually use the image for the newest blurb. Joseph2302 (talk) 14:32, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Post-posting support This is historic. -TenorTwelve (talk) 14:30, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Since Sweden's in the EU, perhaps she'll become the next Merkel. – Sca (talk) 15:25, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Then again, maybe not. – Sca (talk) 20:01, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Update by the nominator Things are looking bad for her and her party now. The Center Party (liberal) voted for the opposition’s budget and it got through. The Center party did not agree with the goverment’s budget, stating it was way too left. That would mean Magdallena now has to rule with right wing economic politics, which she accepted. However their junior party the Green party did not accept it and have left the goverment meaning a new Riksdag election for the prime minister post shall be held. Interesting development. SVT BastianMAT (talk) 16:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Update 2 by nominator Magdallena Andersson has officially resigned. We might have to pull the news back as she won’t be assuming office. She will only assume office if she wins a new prime minister vote, which might take place in a few days/weeks, depending on how the talks with the speaker goes. SVT BastianMAT (talk) 16:46, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Pull (or update the blurb). Her resignation is quickly making international news. 142.182.136.105 (talk) 17:38, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Update blurb Move over Kim Campbell, there's a new sheriff in town. Or more precisely, there was one for a few hours.Scaramouche33 (talk) 17:58, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Pull until it's confirmed whether she will now be the leader or not. Joseph2302 (talk) 18:01, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose pull What is ITNR is that a few hours ago she has been elected by the Swedish parliament. However much she has resigned. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 18:20, 24 November 2021 (UTC) What updating with "and immediately resigns" or something? This is a really weird sequence of events. --Tone 18:21, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Pull - The blurb, as it currently stands, is false.--WaltCip-(talk) 18:50, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Updated to Magdalena Andersson (pictured), shortly after being elected as the first female prime minister of Sweden, resigns. Any further changes, please? --PFHLai (talk) 19:13, 24 November 2021 (UTC) I think this is fine now. --Tone 19:25, 24 November 2021 (UTC) I'm not a big fan of blurbs that contemplate the resignation of a prime minister...But knowing a bit of precedent, it's very likely that in a few days/weeks she will be re-elected, as happened with Löfven in the middle of this year. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 19:48, 24 November 2021 (UTC) For the record, I support this new blurb. It will work until she is finally elected the new PM in a few days or at the longest a week.BabbaQ (talk) 20:21, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks. Hopefully, we'll have an update about her taking office soon. That would be a simple update to do. --PFHLai (talk) 20:31, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Pull -- wait until she actually is seated. She just resigned. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 21:22, 24 November 2021 (UTC) The blurb already says that. It's fine. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 21:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) It's probably just my own bias here; but it seems silly to post this when she just resigned. Forming coalition governments in a parliamentary system is weird. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 21:45, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART)[edit] Article: Double Asteroid Redirection Test (talk · history · tag) Blurb: ?NASA launches DART – the first attempt to change the course of an asteroid (pictured) (Post) Alternative blurb: ?The Double Asteroid Redirection Test spacecraft is launched on a mission to the asteroid Didymos and its moon Dimorphos (artist's impression pictured) Alternative blurb II: ?The Double Asteroid Redirection Test spacecraft is launched on a mission to attempt to deflect the course of the asteroid Dimorphos (artist's impression pictured) News source(s): BBC, Guardian, NYT Credits: Nominated by Andrew Davidson (talk · give credit) Created by Frmorrison (talk · give credit) Updated by CRS-20 (talk · give credit) Article updated Nominator's comments: There's going to be a follow-up launching in 2024 and arriving in 2027 so it's quite a long-term plan. But it's in the news now. Andrew?(talk) 08:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support important mission with global implications, good article. Polyamorph (talk) 08:18, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment. This may be notable as the first mission of its type (to post now); it will be ITNR when it arrives as well. Just saying. 331dot (talk) 08:19, 24 November 2021 (UTC) This may be ITN/R per "first ... launches of any type of rocket" as it's the first mission to use the NEXT drive but that's debatable. Andrew?(talk) 10:09, 24 November 2021 (UTC) The NEXT is the thruster on the spacecraft, not the rocket that put it up there(a Falcon 9). 331dot (talk) 12:31, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Such missions usually have multiple stages and each stage has separate rocket engines. The first stage is usually more spectacular but there's no scientific reason to prefer it. For deep space missions lasting years, the efficiency of the final spacecraft will be most important and this is a new design. Andrew?(talk) 12:54, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support important global mission (even if it does sound like DART is copying the plot of Salvation (TV series)). Added 3 cn tags to article, but apart from that, it looks more than good enough article quality for the front page. Joseph2302 (talk) 09:13, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support Everyone in the world should be happy we'll finally have a way to stop any doomsday asteroids from wiping us all out. Dream Focus 11:15, 24 November 2021 (UTC) If it works, of course... _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 11:39, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support is ITNR from what Andrew says and the global impact of this mission is undoubted, so it's clearly notable. In fact I think it should be one of the most important scientific news of the year. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 11:39, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Global impact?? I thought the idea was to avoid that! Martinevans123 (talk) 13:52, 24 November 2021 (UTC) This event can't be notable, its only impact is on a small unpopulated asteroid! WaltCip-(talk) 14:17, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Impactfulness nonapparent at this pt. in time & space. – Sca (talk) 15:00, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment the proposed blurb is a mess. I've added alt1, though for some reason that's messing up the template formatting - I can't work out why. Modest Genius talk 13:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Also, this is not ITNR, as it's not a new type of rocket and interplanetary probes are ITNR when they arrive at their destination, not when launched. But the gap here is long enough (ten months) that it's reasonable to post both launch and arrival. Modest Genius talk 13:15, 24 November 2021 (UTC) @Modest Genius: I fixed the formatting issue. Adding italics to either of the blurbs breaks it, because italics are already applied by default.--WaltCip-(talk) 13:26, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks. Modest Genius talk 13:44, 24 November 2021 (UTC) The fact that the mission is attempting to alter the course of the asteroid makes this particularly notable. Added alt2. Polyamorph (talk) 13:40, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Alt2 is incorrect. It won't 'deflect the course' of the asteroid. The impact will modify orbit of the moon around the asteroid, not either of their orbits around the Sun. Modest Genius talk 13:44, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Dimorphos is an asteroid (albeit a minor one compared to Didymos). It will deflect its course. Nothing to do with the Sun. Polyamorph (talk) 13:46, 24 November 2021 (UTC) It may deflect its course. – Sca (talk) 15:06, 24 November 2021 (UTC) It will deflect it, even if by only a negligible amount. But this is covered by the wording of alt2 "on a mission to attempt to deflect the course". Polyamorph (talk) 15:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – From what I've seen, this is such a complicated, long-term project that any significant results may be years off. – Sca (talk) 13:30, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose - no mention of Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck or Michael Bay. But seriously Support, though I'd recommend that gallery be trimmed down. --Masem (t) 15:03, 24 November 2021 (UTC) You forgot to mention Taylor Swift. – Sca (talk) 15:07, 24 November 2021 (UTC) @Sca: You mean Liv Tyler :) Brandmeistertalk 20:05, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support ALT2 Very significant, and definitely should be in ITN.

The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 08:33, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose on quality right now the article is a stub, but I expect more information will come out at some point today, so article can be expanded. Event itself is ITN-worthy. Joseph2302 (talk) 10:00, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose It's a bus plunge and so just routine news. Andrew?(talk) 10:10, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Nope, it didn't "plunge", it crashed into a barrier and then caught fire, killing dozens of people. That's not routine anywhere. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 10:35, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Over a million people die on the roads every year – that's over 3,000 every day. The coverage of this case says that "there were often accidents in the area". It's routine. Andrew?(talk) 14:17, 23 November 2021 (UTC) There may have been many accidents, even some fatalities. That section of road has probably been in need of improvement for decades. But not Europe’s worst bus crash for a decade.

Joseph2302 (talk) 08:35, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Not terrorism, according to "sources", so whilst tragic, it appears to be a worse-than-usual crime gone wrong. Black Kite (talk) 08:44, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support -- It seems that around five people died in the attack. The perpetrator has been reported by a few media outlets as Daniel Brooks, a black man who raps under the name "MathboiFly" and has tons of social media posts supporting BLM, and this was in the aftermath of a very notable event where Rittenhouse was cleared as killing two black men in self-defence. OldPeace7068 (talk) 09:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Complete extrapolation. Police have said they believe he was on the run having committed a separate crime, nothing to do with Rittenhouse at all. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 09:35, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Wikipedia is there to report the facts. Police and many members of the public initially considered the possibility of Islamic terrorism due to similar incidents in the past involving Muslims, the targeting of a western festival, and the recent rise in Islamic terrorist activity, but police have now confirmed that this is not terrorism related. Similarly, there have been widespread links/controversy made between the rapper and his connections to BLM, and it has been linked to Rittenhouse whether you like it or not. It is part of the story. The killer is a major supporter and activist of BLM. And this happened in the aftermath of Rittenhouse's acquittal. It's all part of the background and developing story. OldPeace7068 (talk) 09:45, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Not at all. The police have stated he was fleeing a separate scene. Conflating this with BLM/Rittenhouse is pure crystal balling. Thanks. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 09:47, 22 November 2021 (UTC) "two black men" and you'd think we were on a website about facts... CharredWaffle (talk) 14:04, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. Calling this an "attack" may be a misnomer as it appears that the suspect was fleeing the police, not that it was a preplanned attack or terrorism. 331dot (talk) 12:50, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Maybe so. OTOH, at least one report quotes a witness as saying the vehicle seemed to be "targeting people" as it veered from side to side. Also, reports say it crashed through barriers to reach the parade, which seems to indicate that it was indeed an attack, though possibly not a pre-planned one. – Sca (talk) 16:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment The blurb should (and currently does not) mention the country in which this event took place. Chrisclear (talk) 12:56, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose - It's not at all clear that this is an act of terrorism, and thus not something that would be imminently notable.--WaltCip-(talk) 13:09, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose both on merit and article quality. As of this comment, the incident does not appear to have been a deliberate attack. I would be open to reconsideration if contrary information comes to light. Also, at present the article is little more than an oversized stub. It's not ready for the main page. -Ad Orientem (talk) 13:13, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support ... pending expansion of article, which presently comprises a mere 250 words, i.e. a stub.

This event is unusual and widely covered.) – Sca (talk) 14:34, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Not sure this deserves to be on the main page and the article doesn't look very good. ArsenalGhanaPartey (talk) 15:31, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment If the incident turns out not to be terrorist motivated, I honestly don't see it in Main Page, and if it's , with five dead, I 'mnot very clear, although the number of injured is dantesque. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 15:51, 22 November 2021 (UTC) If this is confirmed as an unfortunate series of events with no purposeful motivating factor (driver escaping from knife fight and inadvertently ran through parade crowd), then I would agree this is not really something that should be posted. This doesn't mean motiveless events can't ever be posted but I would expect the results to be more devasting (like the various major building fires or collapses that we had). --Masem (t) 16:36, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Exactly, I think the same Masem. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 17:30, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Wait – As an AP update seems to suggest this was the act of a lone nutcase with a record, I've withdrawn my provisonal support. However, it seems we're still in a wait situation, since nine of the injured are listed in critical condition. If the toll were to rise to double digits, we might still want to consider a blurb about this very nasty event. – Sca (talk) 18:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support if the motivation turns out to be terrorism, neutral if otherwise. Mlb96 (talk) 19:04, 22 November 2021 (UTC) A post – by an IT user with no other contributions – on our article's talk page posits racial motivation. Seems highly dubious at this point, though. – Sca (talk) 19:08, 22 November 2021 (UTC) See WP:RS. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 19:11, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Please see expanded comment above. Thanks. – Sca (talk) 19:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support. This event is in the news and the article looks to be in good shape. -- Tavix (talk) 19:38, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: – Since perp's been ID'd & police say he'll face five counts of first-degree intentional homicide, this is looking potentially more significant. – Sca (talk) 20:02, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Per The Independent this guy had a domestic dispute, and drove his car like a lunatic. Not terror-related, just an idiot behind the wheel. Not significant, tragic, but will never make the top 1000 things that happened on Planet Earth in 2021, let alone the top 250. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support - a mass-casualty event, receiving international coverage (e.g., BBC), a suspect is being charged, and the article has been improved to sufficient quality. Levivich 20:04, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support - rare (even in the US) mass-casualty event. Article quality is decent. Destroyeraa (Alternate account) 20:28, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment a road traffic accident in the US is not rare. Mass-casualty events in the US are far from rare. It's pretty obvious that giving this tragic yet non-terrorist/non-BLM/non-protest/non-deliberate accident undue prominence is not what the encyclopedia was designed to do. Of course, you can dig into the BBC website and find coverage, it's all "shock and think of the children" in the US, but the rest of the world has moved on the moment it was clear it was a sad instance of a crime somewhere else having shitty side-effects, and literally nothing more. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) The last time I remember a similar incident happened in the US was late 2017 when somebody plowed into a crowd in Virginia after a violent demonstration got broken up. We posted the event that it was tangentially related to, largely on the strength of somebody plowing their car into a crowd and killing someone. You supported posting it. Rockphed (talk) 01:03, 23 November 2021 (UTC) If you're referring to Charlottesville car attack, that was about a man deliberately setting out to ram people. This is about a man trying to escape the scene of a domestic incident and getting into a road traffic accident. The two are incomparable. But good try. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 08:07, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Agreeing with previous posters, posting this event would seem to be giving undue weight to a tragic traffic accident. Comparison with the Charlottesville incident from several years back is unfair, given the explicitly political motivations of the earlier event. Wizardoftheyear (talk) 01:17, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Neutral and Wait Yes, with the additional details that have come to light, this is literally a domestic issue that had decidedly more tragic consequences. However, that is additional details. The initial response, and the fact there were several fatalities during a celebration, caught on camera and shared around the world before anyone knew what was going on, has made this major news and a source of intrigue. I think we need to wait to see if the news stations drop their coverage now that there is less intrigue and crisis; if it has effectively left the news cycle by end of day, take this as an oppose, but if it is still on the news banners, take this as support. Kingsif (talk) 01:42, 23 November 2021 (UTC) 4 of the 12 paragraphs in this article start "On November 2X". Typical anti-American bias from the Brits (which is far from rare) notwithstanding, the quality is not there yet. GreatCaesarsGhost 02:23, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Support - Tragic, criminally-induced mass-casualty. Significant details are now known. CoatCheck (talk) 03:03, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Wait It's very clear that there won't be consensus as is, but there may be more of one as things develop. Wait for now. DarkSide830 (talk) 03:46, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Strong Support. This is the deadliest vehicle ramming incident in the United States or Canada since 2018 and the deadliest in the US since 2017. 142.182.136.105 (talk) 07:37, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Comment I see there's been a tragic bus crash in Bulgaria which has killed at least 45 people. It would be safe to presume that supporters of this accident would support the posting of the Bulgarian crash, right? The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 08:09, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Nominate an article on it so that I can assess the quality.

This at first got attention because it might have been terrorism related, no problem there. But all we are left with now is an accident which leaves 5 death: while tragic, this is sadly an everyday occurrence. We have e.g. this week a ferry accident in Sri Lanka (at least 6 death)[5], 7 death in Greece when migrants flee the police[6], 22 deaths on Lake Kivu[7], nine deaths in a fire in Bulgaria[8], 10 deaths in China after a car crash[9], ... I see no reason to post this, as it is not exceptional, has no lasting importance, and isn't even very interesting (without the terrorism angle). It's a sad tragedy, but a very common one. Fram (talk) 17:03, 23 November 2021 (UTC) I think it is WP:TOOSOON to make a determination as to whether this was an act of terror or not. Terrorism or not, the ramming appears to be deliberate, and it has made national and international headlines. Aasim (talk) 06:53, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. Per Fram, tragic, but not significant enough at a global scale: we don't even have articles about many similar tragedies elsewhere. Vanamonde (Talk) 17:45, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose.

Major election in an EU member state. – Illegitimate Barrister (talk • contribs), 02:46, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Question Do we post presidential elections even if the president has mostly symbolic roles? Scaramouche33 (talk) 07:32, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, heads of state elections are posted even if they are ceremonial/wield little power, it mostly depends on the article quality itself which should be more than sufficient. Two examples are the Italian presidental election and Czech presidental election, both having similar powers to the Bulgarian one. [10] [11] BastianMAT (talk) 09:02, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Weak support this article has been on front page for a week already, but I guess the second round presidency vote means that it's ITN eligible again. Article looks to have been sufficiently updated about the presidential second round vote. Joseph2302 (talk) 12:10, 22 November 2021 (UTC) This is not ITNR. We no longer post all elections for head of state- we post the election/choosing of the official with actual executive power, according to List of current heads of state and government; in Bulgaria that is the PM, not the president. 331dot (talk) 12:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) In which case, I oppose this nomination, and it shouldn't have been tagged as ITNR. Joseph2302 (talk) 12:37, 22 November 2021 (UTC) In fairness, it is a recent change that not everyone may be aware of. 331dot (talk) 12:41, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Alright, I thought going by older posts that head of state elections are still part of ITNR but if its been removed, no problem and thanks for the headsup for future nominations. BastianMAT (talk) 12:46, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I just saw this now. I must have missed the change or forgot about it. So my comment on other presidents is not relevant here. --Tone 17:49, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Exactly, that’s what got me confused to when I ITNR nominated this. In the past as you and I mentioned, similar head of state elections (with similar powers) such as Moldova(November 2020), Germany, Austria, Italy, Czech Republic have been posted. 331dot said the removal of ceremonial head of state elections from ITNR were ’recently’ done, so the change must have not been too long ago for us to not know that.BastianMAT (talk) 18:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Blurb on MainPage was updated and moved up --PFHLai (talk) 13:11, 22 November 2021 (UTC) PFHLai there wasn't consensus to do this update- the presidential election is not ITNR, and there was not consensus here that it's important enough for ITN. We should leave it where it is, so it can roll off soon, instead of moving it up so it'll stay on ITN for another week... Joseph2302 (talk) 13:27, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Post posting support If the election was stand-alone, we would probably post it. This is just the case where the general election were held together with the first round of presidential, so there is a single article. I don't see a problem. --Tone 14:56, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I doubt we would post this as a standalone item. He may be head of state, but he has no power. It's the Prime Minister of Bulgaria who would be posted automatically.  — Amakuru (talk) 17:18, 22 November 2021 (UTC) In fact he has been in de facto power since the 2021 April elections as he appointed his friend as acting prime minister. The de jure power he wields is similar to those in Italy and Czech Republic, where he gets to nominate the prime minister and supreme court judges, he can veto laws (although parliament can override) and he of course serves as head of state, don’t forget Bulgaria even has a vice president. In the past we have posted the Italian presidental and Czech Republic presidental elections, both are parliamantary republics too. I thought it was ITNR, but 331dot mentioned that head of state elections (where the head of state is not head of goverment) was recently removed from ITNR. Italian presidental election posted Czech Republic presidental election posted BastianMAT (talk) 17:32, 22 November 2021 (UTC) (ec) As far as I remember we post both if the articles are ok. We've posted presidents of Austria and Germany, which have a similar role, for example. Furthermore, the president of Germany is elected by Bundestag, not by a popular vote. --Tone 17:36, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Pull update and Revert back to previous version per Joseph2302. This guy is just a figure head, and we already posted the main election result. There was no reason to have bumped this up, and the result is not ITN/R so needs consensus, which it doesn't have.  — Amakuru (talk) 17:14, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Pull update and agree with above, not seeing consensus here for this to have even been posted in the first instance. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 17:21, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Beyond the issue of whether it should be on the main page, the blurb is clumsy. "In Bulgaria," is redundant. Where else but in Bulgaria would you be elected President of Bulgaria? Schwede66 17:57, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Restored old blurb. --PFHLai (talk) 18:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose pull Not a head of state change but in the same spirit This post was made by orbitalbuzzsaw gang (talk) 19:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment I think we need some kind of page break to restart voting. A lot of the opposition above was to the unilateral action and not the nom itself. as for me, Oppose while there are some states with significant power invested in the secondary office, this is not one of them. GreatCaesarsGhost 21:55, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I didn't particularly mind about the unilateral action myself - it was made in good faith - and my oppose is purely on the merits of the case, for much the same reasons as you.

The two are about completely different things. -- KTC (talk) 23:12, 19 November 2021 (UTC) I don't think either are worthy of being posted. --RockstoneSend me a message! 01:20, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support per Jehochman. However I'm not quite sure about the term "disappears" here, even if I personally think the Chinese state did exactly that. -- KTC (talk) 23:16, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support per Jehochman. -- Tavix (talk) 23:20, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support this is far more notable than "another white American kills black Americans" and regardless of the fact that headlines are currently obsessing over the US proclivity to allow kids to routinely assassinate people without any kind of criminal conviction, Peng's disappearance is genuinely newsworthy and encyclopedic. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 23:23, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Not that it matters to this nomination, but Rittenhouse's victims were white. GreatCaesarsGhost 00:04, 20 November 2021 (UTC) *cough cough* Rittenhouse's victims were white *cough cough* – John M Wolfson (talk • contribs) 00:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Who said he wasn't talking about Young Dolph's routine assassin? We don't know he wasn't white. We don't know if he had other black American victims. Memphis is all about unsolved mysteries! AGF. InedibleHulk (talk) 02:06, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose on quality The article needs a lot of work, as there are multiple sections with no inline citations.Pawnkingthree (talk) 23:42, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support While this might be unduly implicative of the Chinese state being connected, if RSs are making that connection this definitely belongs. – John M Wolfson (talk • contribs) 00:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose on quality I would support this if the article has some ref work done. There's sections that are unsourced. --TDKR Chicago 101 (talk) 00:34, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose this is newsworthy for sure but blurbing that someone "disappeared" after making an accusation seems like a WP:BLPCRIME issue to me. --LaserLegs (talk) 00:39, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Completely agree it's an awkward thing to summarise in a way that fits BLP while keeping it clear why the event is notable, I'd welcome suggestions for alternative phrasing. I realise this is a fairly limited action, but for that reason I deliberately didn't link to the person she accused in the proposed blurb. Blythwood (talk) 01:57, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose as per LaserLegs, there's something wrong about posting speculation that someone disappeared straight after they made accusations. With little reliable information, this seems like a BLP issue to post it. Joseph2302 (talk) 01:47, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Far too speculative, with overtones of anti-China sentiment, and with too many unknowns. Needs far more clarification before it is posted. And a guarantee that ITN will publish a full We Were Wrong! statement and retraction on the Main page when it is found out she has just eloped with her boyfriend or girlfriend, as the case may be. HiLo48 (talk) 01:55, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Clearly if China "disappeared" her, that would be a story, but this appears to be Western nations making a demand of China and there's no hard evidence she has been killed or imprisoned or the like. We don't post this type of speculative stories. --Masem (t) 02:16, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support Per wide coverage in RSes. Normchou?? 03:22, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose unless the incident has a separate article. Sun8908?Talk 07:38, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support — article looks decent enough for ITN standards by my eye, wide coverage in RSes. If the choice of "disappears" is undesirable, then "is reported missing" might be a potential alternative (posted as altblurb). [osunpokeh/talk/contributions] 08:41, 20 November 2021 (UTC) I think that suggests she was reported missing in the police report sense, not that Novak Djokovic described her as "a missing person" to reporters. Not a bad idea. Just a bit ambiguous. InedibleHulk (talk) 09:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Strong support, in the news, top page news in many countries. The issue is she has suddenly disappeared after accusing a senior cabinet minister of a serious crime, and the involved parties are public figures indept of this incident, so there is nothing wrong as long as it is sourced and not stated as truth. Peng's disappearance and the resulting sports diplomacy pressure and boycott threats are sufficient Bumbubookworm (talk) 12:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Have you ever studied the difference between correlation and causation? HiLo48 (talk) 21:48, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Yes I have and I wonder if it's possible to have a maths competition over Wikipedia lol. I never said there was a causation, although I am sure many on Wikipedia have noted your hard-left POV eg trying to get all right of centre Australian newspapers struck off at RSN. Bumbubookworm (talk) 22:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Applause.

Something that may have happened isn't blurbworthy, no matter how widely it's hyped. – Sca (talk) 13:05, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose per Masem, Sca. It could be the start of something noteworthy, or it could be nothing. We can post when it turns out to be something noteworthy if it does.

Polyamorph (talk) 20:03, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support per above. The article has unref'd sections about her tennis career, but the linked section is ready. Davey2116 (talk) 21:52, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. We shouldn't (and don't) post articles with multiple unsourced sections. The fact that the section linked in bold is referenced is irrelevant. Black Kite (talk) 23:26, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Wait Let's wait until we are 100% sure what has happened to her. Heythereimaguy (talk) 23:53, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Global Times continues to point to her, this time at a restaurant with a coach and friends, seemingly quite visible. Western speculation now turns to whether she's safe, though, or free from external interference or to be believed. All very personal and hard-to-answer questions, for anybody anywhere. InedibleHulk (talk) 00:10, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose it's just one person in a world where much worse things happen in other places like Ethiopia. Banedon (talk) 01:11, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose for now. Videos of Peng Shuai have supposedly surfaced. Nice4What (talk · contribs) – (Thanks ?) 03:30, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Support However, I propose removing the term 'Chinese' in front of Peng Shuai. It does not add to her character or her identity as a professional tennis player. Something along the lines of "Professional tennis player Peng Shuai disappears after accusing former Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli of sexual assault." would be better imo. However, we should also note the videos posted by Global Times editors (primarily those tweeted by editor-in-chief Hu Xijin) and their aftermath. JMonkey2006 (talk) 11:10, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – She's reappeared, online at least. End of story? – Sca (talk) 13:34, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Strong support Wide coverage by RSes and notable. Fakescientist8000 (talk) 14:05, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Still too murky and speculative, with little general impact. – Sca (talk) 15:24, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Leaving aside anything else, there is video evidence of her out and about so she hasn't been "disappeared" and isn't "missing". Whether or not something else is happening is in the realm of speculation, and would require a separate blurb. Also, very large swathes of the article on her career lack even a single citation. Is it not time to close this as no consensus already? Preceding posted by User:BSMRD – Sca (talk) 17:35, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: – Discussion tops 1,500 words.

This applies to a high percentage of the content we post and is unproductive." "International notability" is not a criteria for posting at ITN, nor has it ever been. --Jayron32 19:05, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Well my direct opinion is that it is not notable. My reasoning is the discussion that already took place on the 2021 talk page. I also have previous discussions months ago where things highly notable to one country aren’t included. Elijahandskip (talk) 19:11, 19 November 2021 (UTC) This is not a discussion of the page 2021. The criteria established for other parts of Wikipedia don't apply here. If you wish to change the criteria used for the ITN box, then start a discussion at WT:ITN. Votes without valid rationales are given little weight. It's fine if you have a useful rationale, but merely "I don't think it's notable enough" does not provide any useful guidance to admins when deciding consensus. I mean, you're allowed to say any silly thing you want, I suppose, but you can't expect anyone to take you seriously if it isn't valid. --Jayron32 19:18, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Well since you don’t like my reasoning, just let me say “no”. People have supported ITN’s in the past without giving a reason, so my “Oppose” in this case will not have a reason. Elijahandskip (talk) 19:22, 19 November 2021 (UTC) As I said, it's a free world. People do nonsensical things all of the time. --Jayron32 19:24, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Yep, I couldn’t agree more. In reality, my oppose on this comes more to combat American Wikipedia vs English Wikipedia. There is a essay on Wikipedia that I recently read that has that meaning. Not everything that happens in America is notable for Wikipedia/2021/ITN/Portal Current Events, etc….Elijahandskip (talk) 19:34, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose (at least on news of just the verdict). It was a highly watched case in the U.S., but it was clear early on to many legal experts that are crying foul on judicial behavior. It is very very likely to see an appeal and so this is not the end. This is not like the result from the very public George Floyd protests (which we posted and had ongoing about those, and the verdict). That said, there had been concerns there may be rioting following an acquittal , and while I'm not seeing any immediate news on that, a major riot (akin to the LA riots after King's verdict) would likely be the newsworthy factor here. --Masem (t) 19:05, 19 November 2021 (UTC) There literally cannot be any appeal of a not guilty verdict. This is a core principle of how double jeopardy is handled in American jurisprudence. A not guilty jury verdict is basically always final. See [12]. There are some exceedingly rare exceptions to this, but none of them would apply in this case. An ordinary jury verdict of "not guilty" like this one (even in a controversial trial) is treated as basically sacrosanct, and there can be no appeals by the government. --Jayron32 19:08, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Except for the calls for a mistrial that are being entered now. I know there's complexities with double jeopardy there, but that's still on the books and that itself can be a legal process. --Masem (t) 19:15, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Um, what? There were calls for a mistrial by Rittenhouse's defense team prior to the jury verdict coming back. Now that the verdict is in their client's favor, I doubt highly they will press forward with these requests. Indeed, articles such as this one note "The verdict also meant that Judge Bruce Schroeder did not have to rule on the defense's motions for a mistrial." --Jayron32 19:23, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose as above. If we had to have an American court psychodrama today, the better option from a world-historical perspective would probably be the acquittal of the purported killers of Malcolm X. —Brigade Piron (talk) 19:20, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose AGF, but this is such a small story in the grand scheme. GreatCaesarsGhost 19:23, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Wait. It is too early to tell what impact this will have. It could be a Rodney King-like result where acquittal of the accused leads to broad social unrest, or it could pass with a shrug. I expect that we will know within 24 hours.

I wonder if we should put this blurb up now, or when Parliament repeals them and the farmers go home (don't have strong opinions either way, but I lean towards waiting). If we're going to put it up now, I've uploaded this screengrab of Modi's announcement from his CC-BY YouTube channel; we could use it. Btw Indefensible - Dracophyllum was the only updater, not DiplomatTesterMan. Kind regards, W. Tell DCCXLVI (talk to me!/c) 07:05, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Using the update to put back in ongoing instead of a final blurb would be fine too if preferable. And DiplomatTesterMan did more updates on the article before that, he still deserves some credit too I think. - Indefensible (talk) 07:12, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose because the article is not sufficiently updated. There is currently a 1 sentence mention in the lead of the repeal of the laws, and no mention of it, nor of any follow-on protests, anywhere in the body of the article. Before this can be posted, the latest developments would need to be added to the article appropriately. --Jayron32 12:18, 19 November 2021 (UTC) @Jayron32 Have you read the repeal section? Dracophyllum 20:10, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Your response is 8 hours after Jayron32's, Dracophyllum. The section may have not existed when Jayron commented. But then again, I am not going to take the time to check if it did exist at 12:18 PM UTC on 19 Nov 2021. Tube·of·Light 02:30, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: The announcement by itself has no legal value. Parliament has to repeal the laws, which it will probably do in the coming Winter Session. Also some farmer's unions are continuing protests until the laws are repealed and minimum support prices reconsidered. So it might be better to wait, but no strong opinion either way. --Jose Mathew (talk) 12:24, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Wait and see what the impact of this is.

In fact, we do post many India-centric stories here, this one having festered in ongoing for nearly a year. --LaserLegs (talk) 23:36, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support. Invariably it is announcements that get more attention than the actual act, most of the time(we post elections when the result is known, not when the results are official/certified). If Modi renegs, that will likely be newsworthy itself. 331dot (talk) 23:16, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Weak oppose - as Wilhelm Tell DCCXLVI says, the BKU is still protesting. I would prefer waiting till the laws are actually repealed (and FWIW, these laws are being repealed just before the 2022 Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly elections and elections in some other states, which are crucial for Modi's political party). Tube·of·Light 02:30, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – On article quality – and as others have noted because the laws haven't taken effect.

And of course, there will be no "permanent cancellation of The Boat Race", that's total bollocks, but perhaps inline with your regular contributions. As you perhaps should know already, The Boat Race 2022 is scheduled for next year, and if COVID stymies it, one imagines it will simply be moved to the River Great Ouse once again. I'm unclear as to where you think that a lunar eclipse would be a portent for the permanent cancellation of an event which has been conducted since 1829, even before the Third Reich failed to play nicely. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 17:56, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Ease up, Ramblo, it was a joke. (And BTW, the Third Reich and this topic are entirely unrelated.) – Sca (talk) 18:26, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Yeah, and this topic and the Boat Race are completely unrelated. And it wasn't funny in any sense. So explain yourself. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 18:45, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support, this lunar eclipse has gotten significant news coverage.

The assassination itself, of course, would have been ITN-worthy, as would the convictions of the accused. To me, this is on the same level. BD2412 T 21:30, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Just remembered it won't make DYK as much of the content was copy/pasted from the main article, and it's not 5x from that. ITN it is! – Muboshgu (talk) 21:36, 17 November 2021 (UTC) It was also created nine months ago so any expansion at that time is far too old; you could conceivably get it through DYK if it passes as a Good Article though. ??????? ? 21:43, 17 November 2021 (UTC) It was just moved to mainspace. – Muboshgu (talk) 23:34, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Not only would this by DYK material, it's not even eligible per Muboshgu.

The two who are being exonerated are not independently notable and were released decades ago, so the actual impact is minimal.

The history books are not often changed in such a manner. 331dot (talk) 14:35, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Those two examples were incomparably more significant, as both victims were heads of state. – Sca (talk) 15:24, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Malcolm X was not a head of state but he was highly influential in the cause of civil rights. The point is that history is not often corrected as it was here. 331dot (talk) 16:53, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – per Modest Genius.

Joseph2302 (talk) 20:40, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: Perhaps the blurb can mention the evacuation of thousands of residents and the destruction of infrastructure. Power outage and a small death toll won't cut it. --PFHLai (talk) 22:35, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Comment - this is quite a significant event in Canada, with reports that it could become the most expensive natural disaster in Canadian history [16], the death toll is expected to rise, along with wide ranging effects on supply chains and transportation networks. If I recall correctly, I think we did post the 2013 Alberta floods, for precedent. Connormah (talk) 22:39, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I guess "could be" is key here. If it does become the most expensive natural disaster after electing Trudeau in the history of Canada, then it's well placed for a blurb. Maybe now is premature. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:42, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Wait Living through this, it's a pretty devastating disaster, with all road access cut off to and from the Port of Vancouver, which is having a major impact on supply chains across Western Canada. But I don't think this meets the standard previously set for ITN just yet, although there are reports that the death toll is expected to rise. There's also reports of an imminent dike breach into a large city. As such, I'd suggest that we wait. NorthernFalcon (talk) 22:51, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – Lots of damage & dislocation but so far only one fatal. – Sca (talk) 23:29, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Wait If this gets worse and deadlier, then I will support. Heythereimaguy (talk) 13:02, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Wait per NorthernFalcon & Sca. Modest Genius talk 13:16, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Comment I would further comment that given Port of Vancouver is affected (the fourth largest port in North America by volume of goods) the supply chain issues are pretty notable. [17] CaffeinAddict (talk) 23:11, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, just “affected” the fourth in North America. Not America. Not even in the world. Let's not overestimate it. Storms are storms, and it happen...a lot of things. International impact is very low. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 01:52, 21 November 2021 (UTC) The discussion above is closed. Please do not modify it.

Please read the guidelines. Admin instructions are here. ??Skip to suggestions In the news toolbox Error reports Nominations (Archives) Discussion General criteria Death criteria Recurring items Admin guide Image protection Current events portal v t e Shortcut WP:ITN/C This page provides a forum for editors to suggest items for inclusion on In the news (ITN), a protected template on the Main Page, as well as the forum for discussion of candidates. This is not the page to report errors in the ITN section on the Main Page—please go to the appropriate section at WP:ERRORS. Archives of past nominations can be found here. This candidates page is integrated with the daily pages of Portal:Current events. Under each daily section header below is the transcluded Portal:Current events items for that day (with a light green header). Each day's portal page is followed by a subsection for suggestions and discussion. A blurb is a one sentence summary of the news story. An alternate suggestion for the blurb is called an altblurb, and any more suggestions get labelled alt1, alt2, etc. A blurb needs at least one target article, highlighted in bold; reviewers check the quality of that article and whether it is updated, and whether reliable sources demonstrate the significance of the event. Other articles can also be linked. The Ongoing line is for regularly updated articles which cover events that remain in the news over a longer period of time. RD stands for the "recent deaths" line, and can include any living thing whose death was recently announced. In some cases, recent deaths may need additional explanation as provided by a blurb; this is decided by consensus.

Ongoing: COVID-19 pandemic Recent deaths: Bill Virdon Peter Buck Doug Jones Cedric Robinson David Longdon Jay Last Nominate an article view — page history — related changes — edit How to nominate an item[edit] In order to suggest a candidate: Update an article to be linked to from the blurb to include the recent developments, or find an article that has already been updated. Find the correct section below for the date of the event (not the date nominated). Do not add sections for new dates. These are automatically generated (at midnight UTC) by a bot; creating them manually breaks this process. Nominate the blurb for ITN inclusion under the "Suggestions" subheading for the date, emboldening the link in the blurb to the updated article. Use a level 4 header (====) when doing so. Preferably use the template {{ITN candidate}} to nominate the article related to the event in the news. Make sure that you include a reference from a verifiable, reliable secondary source. Press releases are not acceptable. The suggested blurb should be written in simple present tense. Adding an explanation why the event should be posted greatly increases the odds of posting. Please consider alerting editors to the nomination by adding the template {{ITN note}} to the corresponding article's talk page. Purge this page to update the cache There are criteria which guide the decision on whether or not to put a particular item on In the news, based largely on the extensiveness of the updated content and the perceived significance of the recent developments. These are listed at WP:ITN. Submissions that do not follow the guidelines at Wikipedia:In the news will not be placed onto the live template. Headers[edit] Items that have been posted or pulled from the main page are generally marked with (Posted) or (Pulled) in the item's subject so it is clear they are no longer active. Items can also be marked as (Ready) when the article is both updated and there seems to be a consensus to post. The posting admin, however, should always judge the update and the consensus to post themselves. If you find an entry that you don't feel is ready to post is marked (Ready), you should remove the mark in the header. Voicing an opinion on an item[edit] Format your comment to contain "support" or "oppose", and include a rationale for your choice. In particular, address the notability of the event, the quality of the article, and whether it has been updated. Please do not...[edit] add simple "support!" or "oppose!" votes without including your reasons. Similarly, curt replies such as "who?", "meh", or "duh!" are usually not helpful. Instead, explain the reasons why you think the item meets or does not meet the ITN inclusion criteria so a consensus can be reached. oppose an item because the event is only relating to a single country, or failing to relate to one. This applies to a high percentage of the content we post and is unproductive. accuse other editors of supporting, opposing or nominating due to a personal bias (such as ethnocentrism).

(Radio Sweden) (Reuters) Murder of Ahmaud Arbery verdict[edit] Article: Murder of Ahmaud Arbery (talk · history · tag) Blurb: ?All three men, George McMichael, Travis McMichael, and William Bryan Jr., are found guilty in the Murder of Ahmaud Arbery (Post) News source(s): CNN, The New York Times BBC Credits: Nominated by Andise1 (talk · give credit) Article updated Nominator's comments: Ending to a major court case related to racial issues in the US. Andise1 (talk) 20:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Is it really necessary to discuss such a case again? I refer to here. Yet another case with zero international impact and interest, yet another case of a purely local trial. Far from being akin to the conviction for the murder of George Floyd. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 20:46, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Alsoriano97 If "international impact" was required for postings, very little would be posted. 331dot (talk) 20:47, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, but it should be much more decisive when it comes to court rulings than in other cases (sports, science, elections...). If the follow-up of a trial has a very low international coverage/interest, will you tell me that it's not an important requirement to take into account when determining whether a court case is blurb-worthy or not? So many people are condemned every day in this world... _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 20:58, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Respectfully, we aren't talking about someone convicted of robbing the corner store, but a black man who was murdered basically for being in the wrong neighborhood in a part of the United States where convictions for this sort of thing are rare. And as I said, this incident has influenced changes in laws. 331dot (talk) 21:55, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, laws of a single U.S. state (as far as I know). If it were at the federal level I might come to support it, but not at this one. And many are the events that trigger legislative changes. And without a doubt, the article is in excellent shape. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 22:35, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support. This was a highly followed trial in the US, and even before the verdict this incident resulted in changes in Georgia law(the elimination of citizens' arrests). 331dot (talk) 20:52, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Article is also of decent quality from what I can see. 331dot (talk) 20:57, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support -- this verdict is likely to influence future trials of this type in the United States, and it is an historic decision in an area of the country known for its virulent racism. I doubt a jury would have reached this verdict in that area even 20 years ago. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 21:47, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support High profile case with notable legal impact, quality article. SpencerT•C 21:55, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support. This is a newsworthy verdict, and the article is in good shape from a skim-through. -- Tavix (talk) 21:56, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose people found guilty of crime that they themselves were stupid enough to video. Seriously. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:18, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose It's gotten a lot of attention for emotional reasons, and on a human level the crime was shocking. But its long-term significance is likely to be minimal. People are murdered every day all over the world. Some get a lot of press attention. We almost never post them. -Ad Orientem (talk) 22:25, 24 November 2021 (UTC) It's already had long term significance, both legally and perhaps socially. This was not a garden variety murder. I don't understand this line of thinking more generally. If this event is not notable due to not having "long term significance", it should be proposed for deletion. 331dot (talk) 22:31, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Not at all, there does exist a middle ground between ITN and AFD. This is a prime example. It's the result of a clear-cut murder case which the perps videoed themselves. A no-brainer. What would have been newsworthy would have been this ending in a non-guilty verdict and the no-doubt ensuing riots. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:34, 24 November 2021 (UTC) English channel disaster[edit] Article: November 2021 English Channel disaster (talk · history · tag) Blurb: ?31 people die whilst crossing the English channel (Post) Alternative blurb: ?31 people die whilst crossing the English channel, in the channel's worst disaster in modern times News source(s): https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/world/calais-migrant-drowning-is-worst-ever-in-english-channel-official-says/ar-AAR5RlY https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/11/24/20-migrants-die-boat-capsizes-channel-near-calais/ Credits: Nominated by Llewee (talk · give credit) Nominator's comments: Article needs work but clearly a serious incident which should be posted once the page is ready Llewee (talk) 18:54, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Wait ... pending development of article, now a 150-word stub, more than half reactions. Whilst? – Sca (talk) 19:58, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose for now. Article is not developed enough to be ready for the main page. If that is fixed, it can be posted. Also, none of the blurbs link the article. That will need to be fixed. --Jayron32 20:04, 24 November 2021 (UTC) fixed now Llewee (talk) 21:01, 24 November 2021 (UTC) (Removed) Ongoing removal: 2021 Belarus–European Union border crisis[edit] Article: 2021 Belarus–European Union border crisis (talk · history · tag) Ongoing item removal (Post) Nominator's comments: The article has not has any significant updates for a week, and thus fails the ongoing criteria: In order to be posted to ongoing, the article needs to be regularly updated with new, pertinent information. If there have been significant updates in the last week, these should be added, but right now, this article fails the ongoing criteria. In particular, the last significant update is older than the day of the oldest ITN event (21 November), which is a general rule for something not being updated enough for Ongoing. Joseph2302 (talk) 12:26, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Remove. I think Belarus cleared out migrants from the border; Putin must think he made his point. 331dot (talk) 12:28, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Remove. The migrants have been moved away from the border and the situation has calmed down. No longer an ongoing event. Modest Genius talk 13:05, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – Although the situation appears to have been at least partially defused, there have been reports in recent days that in some cases Belorussian guards have continued to help migrants breach the border into Polish territory. [1], [2] [3] – Sca (talk) 13:27, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Remove the existence of news coverage that Sca notes is a necessary but not sufficient condition for maintaining an ongoing link. The article also needs to have been continuously updated. That clearly didn't happen here. --Jayron32 20:06, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – I have read the reports mentioned by Sca. It appears as if the situation have slowed down, but not ended. So still Ongoing.BabbaQ (talk) 20:23, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Removed. SpencerT•C 21:57, 24 November 2021 (UTC) (Posted) Magdalena Andersson[edit] Article: Magdalena Andersson (talk · history · tag) Blurb: ?Magdalena Andersson (pictured) is elected by the Riksdag as the first female Prime Minister of Sweden. (Post) Alternative blurb: ?Following the resignation of Stefan Löfven, Magdalena Andersson (pictured) is elected by the Riksdag as the first female Prime Minister of Sweden. Alternative blurb II: ?Magdalena Andersson (pictured) is elected as the first female Prime Minister of Sweden. News source(s): BBC Credits: Nominated by BastianMAT (talk · give credit) Article updated The nominated event is listed on WP:ITN/R, so each occurrence is presumed to be important enough to post. Comments should focus on whether the quality of the article and update meet WP:ITNCRIT, not the significance. Nominator's comments: ITNR, as it falls under "Changes in the holder of the office which administer the executive of their respective state/government, in those countries which qualify under the criteria above, as listed at List of current heads of state and government except when that change was already posted as part of a general election". First female prime minister of Sweden. BastianMAT (talk) 09:59, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment she takes office on the 26th (according to her article). Until that point, the blurb isn't correct, as she only becomes the first female PM of Sweden on that date. Is it usual to post when it's announced, or when they take office? Joseph2302 (talk) 10:04, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Usually when they are elected but yeah with the blurb of being elected. BastianMAT (talk) 10:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support - First female PM in Sweden. But change blurb to ”is elected” instead becomes.BabbaQ (talk) 10:06, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Yes. BastianMAT (talk) 10:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support Significant as new PM and first female. Perhaps the blub should be "elected by the Riksdag" since she didn't gain office through a normal election (by the people). cart-Talk 10:15, 24 November 2021 (UTC) That's normal in a parliamentary system. – Sca (talk) 15:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment The blurb should probably start with "Following the resignation of Stefan Löfven, ..." to provide context, since this was not an election outcome but a government reshuffle. --Tone 10:20, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support now the blurb has been changed to "is elected" seems fine to run now. Agree with Tone that we should make it clearer that this wasn't an election that caused this. Joseph2302 (talk) 11:01, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support Her article looks great, is ITNR and altblurb, although somewhat long, it's the most complete and clear of all. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 11:31, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Posting. --Tone 11:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Would suggest that we use the image of Andersson at the front page.BabbaQ (talk) 11:49, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Agree with this, we usually use the image for the newest blurb. Joseph2302 (talk) 14:32, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Post-posting support This is historic. -TenorTwelve (talk) 14:30, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Since Sweden's in the EU, perhaps she'll become the next Merkel. – Sca (talk) 15:25, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Then again, maybe not. – Sca (talk) 20:01, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Update by the nominator Things are looking bad for her and her party now. The Center Party (liberal) voted for the opposition’s budget and it got through. The Center party did not agree with the goverment’s budget, stating it was way too left. That would mean Magdallena now has to rule with right wing economic politics, which she accepted. However their junior party the Green party did not accept it and have left the goverment meaning a new Riksdag election for the prime minister post shall be held. Interesting development. SVT BastianMAT (talk) 16:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Update 2 by nominator Magdallena Andersson has officially resigned. We might have to pull the news back as she won’t be assuming office. She will only assume office if she wins a new prime minister vote, which might take place in a few days/weeks, depending on how the talks with the speaker goes. SVT BastianMAT (talk) 16:46, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Pull (or update the blurb). Her resignation is quickly making international news. 142.182.136.105 (talk) 17:38, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Update blurb Move over Kim Campbell, there's a new sheriff in town. Or more precisely, there was one for a few hours.Scaramouche33 (talk) 17:58, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Pull until it's confirmed whether she will now be the leader or not. Joseph2302 (talk) 18:01, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose pull What is ITNR is that a few hours ago she has been elected by the Swedish parliament. However much she has resigned. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 18:20, 24 November 2021 (UTC) What updating with "and immediately resigns" or something? This is a really weird sequence of events. --Tone 18:21, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Pull - The blurb, as it currently stands, is false.--WaltCip-(talk) 18:50, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Updated to Magdalena Andersson (pictured), shortly after being elected as the first female prime minister of Sweden, resigns. Any further changes, please? --PFHLai (talk) 19:13, 24 November 2021 (UTC) I think this is fine now. --Tone 19:25, 24 November 2021 (UTC) I'm not a big fan of blurbs that contemplate the resignation of a prime minister...But knowing a bit of precedent, it's very likely that in a few days/weeks she will be re-elected, as happened with Löfven in the middle of this year. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 19:48, 24 November 2021 (UTC) For the record, I support this new blurb. It will work until she is finally elected the new PM in a few days or at the longest a week.BabbaQ (talk) 20:21, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks. Hopefully, we'll have an update about her taking office soon. That would be a simple update to do. --PFHLai (talk) 20:31, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Pull -- wait until she actually is seated. She just resigned. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 21:22, 24 November 2021 (UTC) The blurb already says that. It's fine. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 21:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) It's probably just my own bias here; but it seems silly to post this when she just resigned. Forming coalition governments in a parliamentary system is weird. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 21:45, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART)[edit] Article: Double Asteroid Redirection Test (talk · history · tag) Blurb: ?NASA launches DART – the first attempt to change the course of an asteroid (pictured) (Post) Alternative blurb: ?The Double Asteroid Redirection Test spacecraft is launched on a mission to the asteroid Didymos and its moon Dimorphos (artist's impression pictured) Alternative blurb II: ?The Double Asteroid Redirection Test spacecraft is launched on a mission to attempt to deflect the course of the asteroid Dimorphos (artist's impression pictured) News source(s): BBC, Guardian, NYT Credits: Nominated by Andrew Davidson (talk · give credit) Created by Frmorrison (talk · give credit) Updated by CRS-20 (talk · give credit) Article updated Nominator's comments: There's going to be a follow-up launching in 2024 and arriving in 2027 so it's quite a long-term plan. But it's in the news now. Andrew?(talk) 08:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support important mission with global implications, good article. Polyamorph (talk) 08:18, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment. This may be notable as the first mission of its type (to post now); it will be ITNR when it arrives as well. Just saying. 331dot (talk) 08:19, 24 November 2021 (UTC) This may be ITN/R per "first ... launches of any type of rocket" as it's the first mission to use the NEXT drive but that's debatable. Andrew?(talk) 10:09, 24 November 2021 (UTC) The NEXT is the thruster on the spacecraft, not the rocket that put it up there(a Falcon 9). 331dot (talk) 12:31, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Such missions usually have multiple stages and each stage has separate rocket engines. The first stage is usually more spectacular but there's no scientific reason to prefer it. For deep space missions lasting years, the efficiency of the final spacecraft will be most important and this is a new design. Andrew?(talk) 12:54, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support important global mission (even if it does sound like DART is copying the plot of Salvation (TV series)). Added 3 cn tags to article, but apart from that, it looks more than good enough article quality for the front page. Joseph2302 (talk) 09:13, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support Everyone in the world should be happy we'll finally have a way to stop any doomsday asteroids from wiping us all out. Dream Focus 11:15, 24 November 2021 (UTC) If it works, of course... _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 11:39, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support is ITNR from what Andrew says and the global impact of this mission is undoubted, so it's clearly notable. In fact I think it should be one of the most important scientific news of the year. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 11:39, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Global impact?? I thought the idea was to avoid that! Martinevans123 (talk) 13:52, 24 November 2021 (UTC) This event can't be notable, its only impact is on a small unpopulated asteroid! WaltCip-(talk) 14:17, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Impactfulness nonapparent at this pt. in time & space. – Sca (talk) 15:00, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment the proposed blurb is a mess. I've added alt1, though for some reason that's messing up the template formatting - I can't work out why. Modest Genius talk 13:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Also, this is not ITNR, as it's not a new type of rocket and interplanetary probes are ITNR when they arrive at their destination, not when launched. But the gap here is long enough (ten months) that it's reasonable to post both launch and arrival. Modest Genius talk 13:15, 24 November 2021 (UTC) @Modest Genius: I fixed the formatting issue. Adding italics to either of the blurbs breaks it, because italics are already applied by default.--WaltCip-(talk) 13:26, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks. Modest Genius talk 13:44, 24 November 2021 (UTC) The fact that the mission is attempting to alter the course of the asteroid makes this particularly notable. Added alt2. Polyamorph (talk) 13:40, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Alt2 is incorrect. It won't 'deflect the course' of the asteroid. The impact will modify orbit of the moon around the asteroid, not either of their orbits around the Sun. Modest Genius talk 13:44, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Dimorphos is an asteroid (albeit a minor one compared to Didymos). It will deflect its course. Nothing to do with the Sun. Polyamorph (talk) 13:46, 24 November 2021 (UTC) It may deflect its course. – Sca (talk) 15:06, 24 November 2021 (UTC) It will deflect it, even if by only a negligible amount.

Joseph2302 (talk) 08:35, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Not terrorism, according to "sources", so whilst tragic, it appears to be a worse-than-usual crime gone wrong. Black Kite (talk) 08:44, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support -- It seems that around five people died in the attack. The perpetrator has been reported by a few media outlets as Daniel Brooks, a black man who raps under the name "MathboiFly" and has tons of social media posts supporting BLM, and this was in the aftermath of a very notable event where Rittenhouse was cleared as killing two black men in self-defence. OldPeace7068 (talk) 09:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Complete extrapolation. Police have said they believe he was on the run having committed a separate crime, nothing to do with Rittenhouse at all. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 09:35, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Wikipedia is there to report the facts. Police and many members of the public initially considered the possibility of Islamic terrorism due to similar incidents in the past involving Muslims, the targeting of a western festival, and the recent rise in Islamic terrorist activity, but police have now confirmed that this is not terrorism related. Similarly, there have been widespread links/controversy made between the rapper and his connections to BLM, and it has been linked to Rittenhouse whether you like it or not. It is part of the story. The killer is a major supporter and activist of BLM. And this happened in the aftermath of Rittenhouse's acquittal. It's all part of the background and developing story. OldPeace7068 (talk) 09:45, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Not at all. The police have stated he was fleeing a separate scene. Conflating this with BLM/Rittenhouse is pure crystal balling. Thanks. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 09:47, 22 November 2021 (UTC) "two black men" and you'd think we were on a website about facts... CharredWaffle (talk) 14:04, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. Calling this an "attack" may be a misnomer as it appears that the suspect was fleeing the police, not that it was a preplanned attack or terrorism. 331dot (talk) 12:50, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Maybe so. OTOH, at least one report quotes a witness as saying the vehicle seemed to be "targeting people" as it veered from side to side. Also, reports say it crashed through barriers to reach the parade, which seems to indicate that it was indeed an attack, though possibly not a pre-planned one. – Sca (talk) 16:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment The blurb should (and currently does not) mention the country in which this event took place. Chrisclear (talk) 12:56, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose - It's not at all clear that this is an act of terrorism, and thus not something that would be imminently notable.--WaltCip-(talk) 13:09, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose both on merit and article quality. As of this comment, the incident does not appear to have been a deliberate attack. I would be open to reconsideration if contrary information comes to light. Also, at present the article is little more than an oversized stub. It's not ready for the main page. -Ad Orientem (talk) 13:13, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support ... pending expansion of article, which presently comprises a mere 250 words, i.e. a stub.

This doesn't mean motiveless events can't ever be posted but I would expect the results to be more devasting (like the various major building fires or collapses that we had). --Masem (t) 16:36, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Exactly, I think the same Masem. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 17:30, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Wait – As an AP update seems to suggest this was the act of a lone nutcase with a record, I've withdrawn my provisonal support. However, it seems we're still in a wait situation, since nine of the injured are listed in critical condition. If the toll were to rise to double digits, we might still want to consider a blurb about this very nasty event. – Sca (talk) 18:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support if the motivation turns out to be terrorism, neutral if otherwise. Mlb96 (talk) 19:04, 22 November 2021 (UTC) A post – by an IT user with no other contributions – on our article's talk page posits racial motivation.

Not terror-related, just an idiot behind the wheel. Not significant, tragic, but will never make the top 1000 things that happened on Planet Earth in 2021, let alone the top 250. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support - a mass-casualty event, receiving international coverage (e.g., BBC), a suspect is being charged, and the article has been improved to sufficient quality. Levivich 20:04, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support - rare (even in the US) mass-casualty event. Article quality is decent. Destroyeraa (Alternate account) 20:28, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment a road traffic accident in the US is not rare. Mass-casualty events in the US are far from rare. It's pretty obvious that giving this tragic yet non-terrorist/non-BLM/non-protest/non-deliberate accident undue prominence is not what the encyclopedia was designed to do. Of course, you can dig into the BBC website and find coverage, it's all "shock and think of the children" in the US, but the rest of the world has moved on the moment it was clear it was a sad instance of a crime somewhere else having shitty side-effects, and literally nothing more. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) The last time I remember a similar incident happened in the US was late 2017 when somebody plowed into a crowd in Virginia after a violent demonstration got broken up. We posted the event that it was tangentially related to, largely on the strength of somebody plowing their car into a crowd and killing someone. You supported posting it. Rockphed (talk) 01:03, 23 November 2021 (UTC) If you're referring to Charlottesville car attack, that was about a man deliberately setting out to ram people. This is about a man trying to escape the scene of a domestic incident and getting into a road traffic accident. The two are incomparable. But good try. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 08:07, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Agreeing with previous posters, posting this event would seem to be giving undue weight to a tragic traffic accident. Comparison with the Charlottesville incident from several years back is unfair, given the explicitly political motivations of the earlier event. Wizardoftheyear (talk) 01:17, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Neutral and Wait Yes, with the additional details that have come to light, this is literally a domestic issue that had decidedly more tragic consequences. However, that is additional details. The initial response, and the fact there were several fatalities during a celebration, caught on camera and shared around the world before anyone knew what was going on, has made this major news and a source of intrigue. I think we need to wait to see if the news stations drop their coverage now that there is less intrigue and crisis; if it has effectively left the news cycle by end of day, take this as an oppose, but if it is still on the news banners, take this as support. Kingsif (talk) 01:42, 23 November 2021 (UTC) 4 of the 12 paragraphs in this article start "On November 2X". Typical anti-American bias from the Brits (which is far from rare) notwithstanding, the quality is not there yet. GreatCaesarsGhost 02:23, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Support - Tragic, criminally-induced mass-casualty. Significant details are now known. CoatCheck (talk) 03:03, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Wait It's very clear that there won't be consensus as is, but there may be more of one as things develop. Wait for now. DarkSide830 (talk) 03:46, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Strong Support. This is the deadliest vehicle ramming incident in the United States or Canada since 2018 and the deadliest in the US since 2017. 142.182.136.105 (talk) 07:37, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Comment I see there's been a tragic bus crash in Bulgaria which has killed at least 45 people. It would be safe to presume that supporters of this accident would support the posting of the Bulgarian crash, right? The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 08:09, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Nominate an article on it so that I can assess the quality. Without knowing what we are posting on the main page, it is impossible for me to know if the article is appropriate. --Jayron32 12:56, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Four hours ago....

This at first got attention because it might have been terrorism related, no problem there. But all we are left with now is an accident which leaves 5 death: while tragic, this is sadly an everyday occurrence. We have e.g. this week a ferry accident in Sri Lanka (at least 6 death)[5], 7 death in Greece when migrants flee the police[6], 22 deaths on Lake Kivu[7], nine deaths in a fire in Bulgaria[8], 10 deaths in China after a car crash[9], ... I see no reason to post this, as it is not exceptional, has no lasting importance, and isn't even very interesting (without the terrorism angle). It's a sad tragedy, but a very common one. Fram (talk) 17:03, 23 November 2021 (UTC) I think it is WP:TOOSOON to make a determination as to whether this was an act of terror or not. Terrorism or not, the ramming appears to be deliberate, and it has made national and international headlines. Aasim (talk) 06:53, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. Per Fram, tragic, but not significant enough at a global scale: we don't even have articles about many similar tragedies elsewhere. Vanamonde (Talk) 17:45, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose.

Major election in an EU member state. – Illegitimate Barrister (talk • contribs), 02:46, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Question Do we post presidential elections even if the president has mostly symbolic roles? Scaramouche33 (talk) 07:32, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, heads of state elections are posted even if they are ceremonial/wield little power, it mostly depends on the article quality itself which should be more than sufficient. Two examples are the Italian presidental election and Czech presidental election, both having similar powers to the Bulgarian one. [10] [11] BastianMAT (talk) 09:02, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Weak support this article has been on front page for a week already, but I guess the second round presidency vote means that it's ITN eligible again. Article looks to have been sufficiently updated about the presidential second round vote. Joseph2302 (talk) 12:10, 22 November 2021 (UTC) This is not ITNR. We no longer post all elections for head of state- we post the election/choosing of the official with actual executive power, according to List of current heads of state and government; in Bulgaria that is the PM, not the president. 331dot (talk) 12:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) In which case, I oppose this nomination, and it shouldn't have been tagged as ITNR. Joseph2302 (talk) 12:37, 22 November 2021 (UTC) In fairness, it is a recent change that not everyone may be aware of. 331dot (talk) 12:41, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Alright, I thought going by older posts that head of state elections are still part of ITNR but if its been removed, no problem and thanks for the headsup for future nominations. BastianMAT (talk) 12:46, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I just saw this now. I must have missed the change or forgot about it. So my comment on other presidents is not relevant here. --Tone 17:49, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Exactly, that’s what got me confused to when I ITNR nominated this. In the past as you and I mentioned, similar head of state elections (with similar powers) such as Moldova(November 2020), Germany, Austria, Italy, Czech Republic have been posted. 331dot said the removal of ceremonial head of state elections from ITNR were ’recently’ done, so the change must have not been too long ago for us to not know that.BastianMAT (talk) 18:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Blurb on MainPage was updated and moved up --PFHLai (talk) 13:11, 22 November 2021 (UTC) PFHLai there wasn't consensus to do this update- the presidential election is not ITNR, and there was not consensus here that it's important enough for ITN. We should leave it where it is, so it can roll off soon, instead of moving it up so it'll stay on ITN for another week... Joseph2302 (talk) 13:27, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Post posting support If the election was stand-alone, we would probably post it. This is just the case where the general election were held together with the first round of presidential, so there is a single article. I don't see a problem. --Tone 14:56, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I doubt we would post this as a standalone item. He may be head of state, but he has no power. It's the Prime Minister of Bulgaria who would be posted automatically.  — Amakuru (talk) 17:18, 22 November 2021 (UTC) In fact he has been in de facto power since the 2021 April elections as he appointed his friend as acting prime minister. The de jure power he wields is similar to those in Italy and Czech Republic, where he gets to nominate the prime minister and supreme court judges, he can veto laws (although parliament can override) and he of course serves as head of state, don’t forget Bulgaria even has a vice president. In the past we have posted the Italian presidental and Czech Republic presidental elections, both are parliamantary republics too. I thought it was ITNR, but 331dot mentioned that head of state elections (where the head of state is not head of goverment) was recently removed from ITNR. Italian presidental election posted Czech Republic presidental election posted BastianMAT (talk) 17:32, 22 November 2021 (UTC) (ec) As far as I remember we post both if the articles are ok. We've posted presidents of Austria and Germany, which have a similar role, for example. Furthermore, the president of Germany is elected by Bundestag, not by a popular vote. --Tone 17:36, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Pull update and Revert back to previous version per Joseph2302. This guy is just a figure head, and we already posted the main election result. There was no reason to have bumped this up, and the result is not ITN/R so needs consensus, which it doesn't have.  — Amakuru (talk) 17:14, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Pull update and agree with above, not seeing consensus here for this to have even been posted in the first instance. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 17:21, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Beyond the issue of whether it should be on the main page, the blurb is clumsy. "In Bulgaria," is redundant. Where else but in Bulgaria would you be elected President of Bulgaria? Schwede66 17:57, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Restored old blurb. --PFHLai (talk) 18:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose pull Not a head of state change but in the same spirit This post was made by orbitalbuzzsaw gang (talk) 19:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment I think we need some kind of page break to restart voting. A lot of the opposition above was to the unilateral action and not the nom itself. as for me, Oppose while there are some states with significant power invested in the secondary office, this is not one of them. GreatCaesarsGhost 21:55, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I didn't particularly mind about the unilateral action myself - it was made in good faith - and my oppose is purely on the merits of the case, for much the same reasons as you.

Article: Peng Shuai (talk · history · tag) Blurb: ?Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai disappears after accusing a former Chinese Vice Premier of sexual assault. (Post) Alternative blurb: ?Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai is reported missing after accusing former Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli of sexual assault. News source(s): Guardian Credits: Nominated by Blythwood (talk · give credit) Article updatedNominator's comments: Seems to be a forced disappearance. This is a bit unusual, but has been a major news story. Disappearance section seems solid but the rest of the article on her career is less well sourced. The person has disappeared without a trace, so while it cannot be verified that this person person has died or been imprisoned, her disappearance is in itself the notable event. I wonder if this could be treated as something like the equivalent of a recent death. Blythwood (talk) 22:39, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support - Article is in good condition and the news is prominent, exceptional, and of great public interest around the world. Jehochman Talk 22:45, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose - Article appear in news, but headlines on CBC, CNN, BBC are still focused on Rittenhouse Trial for now, although this may change. Otherwise, the blurb should describe whats happening now (the reactions), that she has not been publicly heard is not ITN as that is a few days old. 99.247.176.90 (talk) 23:06, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose - I fail to see how this is any more worthy of ITN than the Rittenhouse trial, which was also not worthy of ITN. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 23:10, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Please don't oppose because you think another nomination should be posted and you don't think this one is as worthy. Judge nomination on its own merit. The two are about completely different things. -- KTC (talk) 23:12, 19 November 2021 (UTC) I don't think either are worthy of being posted. --RockstoneSend me a message! 01:20, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support per Jehochman. However I'm not quite sure about the term "disappears" here, even if I personally think the Chinese state did exactly that. -- KTC (talk) 23:16, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support per Jehochman. -- Tavix (talk) 23:20, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support this is far more notable than "another white American kills black Americans" and regardless of the fact that headlines are currently obsessing over the US proclivity to allow kids to routinely assassinate people without any kind of criminal conviction, Peng's disappearance is genuinely newsworthy and encyclopedic. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 23:23, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Not that it matters to this nomination, but Rittenhouse's victims were white. GreatCaesarsGhost 00:04, 20 November 2021 (UTC) *cough cough* Rittenhouse's victims were white *cough cough* – John M Wolfson (talk • contribs) 00:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Who said he wasn't talking about Young Dolph's routine assassin? We don't know he wasn't white. We don't know if he had other black American victims. Memphis is all about unsolved mysteries! AGF. InedibleHulk (talk) 02:06, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose on quality The article needs a lot of work, as there are multiple sections with no inline citations.Pawnkingthree (talk) 23:42, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support While this might be unduly implicative of the Chinese state being connected, if RSs are making that connection this definitely belongs. – John M Wolfson (talk • contribs) 00:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose on quality I would support this if the article has some ref work done. There's sections that are unsourced. --TDKR Chicago 101 (talk) 00:34, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose this is newsworthy for sure but blurbing that someone "disappeared" after making an accusation seems like a WP:BLPCRIME issue to me. --LaserLegs (talk) 00:39, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Completely agree it's an awkward thing to summarise in a way that fits BLP while keeping it clear why the event is notable, I'd welcome suggestions for alternative phrasing. I realise this is a fairly limited action, but for that reason I deliberately didn't link to the person she accused in the proposed blurb. Blythwood (talk) 01:57, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose as per LaserLegs, there's something wrong about posting speculation that someone disappeared straight after they made accusations. With little reliable information, this seems like a BLP issue to post it. Joseph2302 (talk) 01:47, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Far too speculative, with overtones of anti-China sentiment, and with too many unknowns. Needs far more clarification before it is posted. And a guarantee that ITN will publish a full We Were Wrong! statement and retraction on the Main page when it is found out she has just eloped with her boyfriend or girlfriend, as the case may be. HiLo48 (talk) 01:55, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Clearly if China "disappeared" her, that would be a story, but this appears to be Western nations making a demand of China and there's no hard evidence she has been killed or imprisoned or the like. We don't post this type of speculative stories. --Masem (t) 02:16, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support Per wide coverage in RSes. Normchou?? 03:22, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose unless the incident has a separate article. Sun8908?Talk 07:38, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support — article looks decent enough for ITN standards by my eye, wide coverage in RSes. If the choice of "disappears" is undesirable, then "is reported missing" might be a potential alternative (posted as altblurb). [osunpokeh/talk/contributions] 08:41, 20 November 2021 (UTC) I think that suggests she was reported missing in the police report sense, not that Novak Djokovic described her as "a missing person" to reporters. Not a bad idea. Just a bit ambiguous. InedibleHulk (talk) 09:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Strong support, in the news, top page news in many countries. The issue is she has suddenly disappeared after accusing a senior cabinet minister of a serious crime, and the involved parties are public figures indept of this incident, so there is nothing wrong as long as it is sourced and not stated as truth. Peng's disappearance and the resulting sports diplomacy pressure and boycott threats are sufficient Bumbubookworm (talk) 12:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Have you ever studied the difference between correlation and causation? HiLo48 (talk) 21:48, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Yes I have and I wonder if it's possible to have a maths competition over Wikipedia lol. I never said there was a causation, although I am sure many on Wikipedia have noted your hard-left POV eg trying to get all right of centre Australian newspapers struck off at RSN. Bumbubookworm (talk) 22:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Applause. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:33, 20 November 2021 (UTC) I am adding sources to the career section Bumbubookworm (talk) 12:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – Per Masem, Joseph2302. Something that may have happened isn't blurbworthy, no matter how widely it's hyped. – Sca (talk) 13:05, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose per Masem, Sca. It could be the start of something noteworthy, or it could be nothing. We can post when it turns out to be something noteworthy if it does. Usedtobecool ?? 13:23, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support - Do we post news around here anymore? Sometimes I do wonder.--WaltCip-(talk) 18:40, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support highly notable, good article. Polyamorph (talk) 20:03, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support per above. The article has unref'd sections about her tennis career, but the linked section is ready. Davey2116 (talk) 21:52, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. We shouldn't (and don't) post articles with multiple unsourced sections. The fact that the section linked in bold is referenced is irrelevant. Black Kite (talk) 23:26, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Wait Let's wait until we are 100% sure what has happened to her. Heythereimaguy (talk) 23:53, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Global Times continues to point to her, this time at a restaurant with a coach and friends, seemingly quite visible. Western speculation now turns to whether she's safe, though, or free from external interference or to be believed. All very personal and hard-to-answer questions, for anybody anywhere. InedibleHulk (talk) 00:10, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose it's just one person in a world where much worse things happen in other places like Ethiopia. Banedon (talk) 01:11, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose for now. Videos of Peng Shuai have supposedly surfaced. Nice4What (talk · contribs) – (Thanks ?) 03:30, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Support However, I propose removing the term 'Chinese' in front of Peng Shuai. It does not add to her character or her identity as a professional tennis player. Something along the lines of "Professional tennis player Peng Shuai disappears after accusing former Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli of sexual assault." would be better imo. However, we should also note the videos posted by Global Times editors (primarily those tweeted by editor-in-chief Hu Xijin) and their aftermath. JMonkey2006 (talk) 11:10, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – She's reappeared, online at least. End of story? – Sca (talk) 13:34, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Strong support Wide coverage by RSes and notable. Fakescientist8000 (talk) 14:05, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Still too murky and speculative, with little general impact. – Sca (talk) 15:24, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Leaving aside anything else, there is video evidence of her out and about so she hasn't been "disappeared" and isn't "missing". Whether or not something else is happening is in the realm of speculation, and would require a separate blurb. Also, very large swathes of the article on her career lack even a single citation. Is it not time to close this as no consensus already? Preceding posted by User:BSMRD – Sca (talk) 17:35, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: – Discussion tops 1,500 words. Posts running 4:3 against. – Sca (talk) 17:42, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Comment as nominator I'm willing to close soon now there's video of her alive (barring any big development, like it rapidly emerging this is an impersonator). Someone being in big trouble with their government isn't ITN-worthy, although I still think someone being forced-disappeared could be.

A few WP:PROSELINE-issues, but not enough to downgrade the quality too much. Topic has been, and is being covered extensively by quality, reliable news sources in a way that would indicate this is a significant story. Checks all of the boxes for me. --Jayron32 18:55, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose to international notability. It won’t be listed on 2021 per previous discussions of it not having international notability. Elijahandskip (talk) 19:02, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Elijahandskip, #Please do not... oppose an item because the event is only relating to a single country, or failing to relate to one. This applies to a high percentage of the content we post and is unproductive. – Muboshgu (talk) 19:04, 19 November 2021 (UTC) (edit conflict):*See the instructions above "Please do not...oppose an item because the event is only relating to a single country, or failing to relate to one. This applies to a high percentage of the content we post and is unproductive." "International notability" is not a criteria for posting at ITN, nor has it ever been. --Jayron32 19:05, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Well my direct opinion is that it is not notable. My reasoning is the discussion that already took place on the 2021 talk page. I also have previous discussions months ago where things highly notable to one country aren’t included. Elijahandskip (talk) 19:11, 19 November 2021 (UTC) This is not a discussion of the page 2021. The criteria established for other parts of Wikipedia don't apply here. If you wish to change the criteria used for the ITN box, then start a discussion at WT:ITN. Votes without valid rationales are given little weight. It's fine if you have a useful rationale, but merely "I don't think it's notable enough" does not provide any useful guidance to admins when deciding consensus. I mean, you're allowed to say any silly thing you want, I suppose, but you can't expect anyone to take you seriously if it isn't valid. --Jayron32 19:18, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Well since you don’t like my reasoning, just let me say “no”. People have supported ITN’s in the past without giving a reason, so my “Oppose” in this case will not have a reason. Elijahandskip (talk) 19:22, 19 November 2021 (UTC) As I said, it's a free world. People do nonsensical things all of the time. --Jayron32 19:24, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Yep, I couldn’t agree more. In reality, my oppose on this comes more to combat American Wikipedia vs English Wikipedia. There is a essay on Wikipedia that I recently read that has that meaning. Not everything that happens in America is notable for Wikipedia/2021/ITN/Portal Current Events, etc….Elijahandskip (talk) 19:34, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose (at least on news of just the verdict). It was a highly watched case in the U.S., but it was clear early on to many legal experts that are crying foul on judicial behavior. It is very very likely to see an appeal and so this is not the end. This is not like the result from the very public George Floyd protests (which we posted and had ongoing about those, and the verdict). That said, there had been concerns there may be rioting following an acquittal , and while I'm not seeing any immediate news on that, a major riot (akin to the LA riots after King's verdict) would likely be the newsworthy factor here. --Masem (t) 19:05, 19 November 2021 (UTC) There literally cannot be any appeal of a not guilty verdict. This is a core principle of how double jeopardy is handled in American jurisprudence. A not guilty jury verdict is basically always final. See [12]. There are some exceedingly rare exceptions to this, but none of them would apply in this case. An ordinary jury verdict of "not guilty" like this one (even in a controversial trial) is treated as basically sacrosanct, and there can be no appeals by the government. --Jayron32 19:08, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Except for the calls for a mistrial that are being entered now. I know there's complexities with double jeopardy there, but that's still on the books and that itself can be a legal process. --Masem (t) 19:15, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Um, what? There were calls for a mistrial by Rittenhouse's defense team prior to the jury verdict coming back. Now that the verdict is in their client's favor, I doubt highly they will press forward with these requests. Indeed, articles such as this one note "The verdict also meant that Judge Bruce Schroeder did not have to rule on the defense's motions for a mistrial." --Jayron32 19:23, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose as above. If we had to have an American court psychodrama today, the better option from a world-historical perspective would probably be the acquittal of the purported killers of Malcolm X. —Brigade Piron (talk) 19:20, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose AGF, but this is such a small story in the grand scheme. GreatCaesarsGhost 19:23, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Wait. It is too early to tell what impact this will have. It could be a Rodney King-like result where acquittal of the accused leads to broad social unrest, or it could pass with a shrug. I expect that we will know within 24 hours. BD2412 T 19:30, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose and close US-centric nomination, not important enough for ITN. Joseph2302 (talk) 19:45, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose and renominate once the riots get into full swing. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 19:49, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose per above. Far from blurb-worthy, lack of deep international coverage and interest. U.S-centric. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 19:58, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Very US centric. It's probably not even the most important news in the US right now, let alone the world. I agree with Piron above that the clearing of Malcom X's killers is more noteworthy in the grand scheme. CaptainEek Edits Ho Cap'n!? 20:32, 19 November 2021 (UTC) It is the most important US news event ongoing right now.

(Post) News source(s): AP, WSJ Credits: Nominated by Indefensible (talk · give credit) Updated by Dracophyllum (talk · give credit) and DiplomatTesterMan (talk · give credit) Nominator's comments: This article was previously in ongoing, now has a noteworthy update which should bring it towards conclusion. - Indefensible (talk) 06:50, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: One of the major farmers' unions behind the protests, Bharatiya Kisan Union, has promised to continue protesting till the laws are actually repealed (source). I wonder if we should put this blurb up now, or when Parliament repeals them and the farmers go home (don't have strong opinions either way, but I lean towards waiting). If we're going to put it up now, I've uploaded this screengrab of Modi's announcement from his CC-BY YouTube channel; we could use it. Btw Indefensible - Dracophyllum was the only updater, not DiplomatTesterMan. Kind regards, W. Tell DCCXLVI (talk to me!/c) 07:05, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Using the update to put back in ongoing instead of a final blurb would be fine too if preferable. And DiplomatTesterMan did more updates on the article before that, he still deserves some credit too I think. - Indefensible (talk) 07:12, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose because the article is not sufficiently updated. There is currently a 1 sentence mention in the lead of the repeal of the laws, and no mention of it, nor of any follow-on protests, anywhere in the body of the article. Before this can be posted, the latest developments would need to be added to the article appropriately. --Jayron32 12:18, 19 November 2021 (UTC) @Jayron32 Have you read the repeal section? Dracophyllum 20:10, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Your response is 8 hours after Jayron32's, Dracophyllum. The section may have not existed when Jayron commented. But then again, I am not going to take the time to check if it did exist at 12:18 PM UTC on 19 Nov 2021. Tube·of·Light 02:30, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: The announcement by itself has no legal value. Parliament has to repeal the laws, which it will probably do in the coming Winter Session. Also some farmer's unions are continuing protests until the laws are repealed and minimum support prices reconsidered. So it might be better to wait, but no strong opinion either way. --Jose Mathew (talk) 12:24, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Wait and see what the impact of this is. Right now, there isn't enough information on what will happen as a result of this. Joseph2302 (talk) 13:06, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose --LaserLegs (talk) 22:54, 19 November 2021 (UTC) to international notability. It won’t be listed on 2021 per previous discussions of it not having international notability. India-centric nomination, not important enough for ITN and renominate once the riots get into full swing. per above. Far from blurb-worthy, lack of deep international coverage and interest. India-centric Very India centric. It's probably not even the most important news in India right now, let alone the world. Actually not even sure this is going to be more than a couple days' news in India "Please do not oppose an item because the event is only relating to a single country, or failing to relate to one. This applies to a high percentage of the content we post and is unproductive." 331dot (talk) 23:11, 19 November 2021 (UTC) It's important to remember that 1/7 of the people on this planet are Indians. We don’t post a great deal of India related stories. 331dot (talk) 23:13, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Interestingly I didn't see the same PDM feedback from you above for another "country-centric" nomination from the worlds third most populous country. In fact, we do post many India-centric stories here, this one having festered in ongoing for nearly a year. --LaserLegs (talk) 23:36, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support. Invariably it is announcements that get more attention than the actual act, most of the time(we post elections when the result is known, not when the results are official/certified). If Modi renegs, that will likely be newsworthy itself. 331dot (talk) 23:16, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Weak oppose - as Wilhelm Tell DCCXLVI says, the BKU is still protesting. I would prefer waiting till the laws are actually repealed (and FWIW, these laws are being repealed just before the 2022 Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly elections and elections in some other states, which are crucial for Modi's political party). Tube·of·Light 02:30, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – On article quality – and as others have noted because the laws haven't taken effect. The article, at more than 10,000 words, is grossly overwritten, overblown and overweight – presumably by partisans who view the topic as a cause célèbre that calls for a crusade. – Sca (talk) 13:20, 20 November 2021 (UTC) (Closed) November 2021 lunar eclipse[edit] Consensus will not develop to post this.

The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 21:41, 19 November 2021 (UTC) You're forgetting that lunar eclipses often presage globally cataclysmic events, such as permanent cancellation of The Boat Race, which I fear may now be in the offing for 2022. – Sca (talk) 13:30, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Of course, lunar eclipses and the Boat Race are entirely unrelated. And of course, there will be no "permanent cancellation of The Boat Race", that's total bollocks, but perhaps inline with your regular contributions. As you perhaps should know already, The Boat Race 2022 is scheduled for next year, and if COVID stymies it, one imagines it will simply be moved to the River Great Ouse once again. I'm unclear as to where you think that a lunar eclipse would be a portent for the permanent cancellation of an event which has been conducted since 1829, even before the Third Reich failed to play nicely. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 17:56, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Ease up, Ramblo, it was a joke. (And BTW, the Third Reich and this topic are entirely unrelated.) – Sca (talk) 18:26, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Yeah, and this topic and the Boat Race are completely unrelated. And it wasn't funny in any sense. So explain yourself. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 18:45, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support, this lunar eclipse has gotten significant news coverage.

The assassination itself, of course, would have been ITN-worthy, as would the convictions of the accused. To me, this is on the same level. BD2412 T 21:30, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Just remembered it won't make DYK as much of the content was copy/pasted from the main article, and it's not 5x from that.

The two who are being exonerated are not independently notable and were released decades ago, so the actual impact is minimal.

If it was found that John Wilkes Booth did not assassinate Lincoln, or that Lee Harvey Oswald did not assassinate JFK, it would be posted, and I don't see how this is different. The history books are not often changed in such a manner. 331dot (talk) 14:35, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Those two examples were incomparably more significant, as both victims were heads of state. – Sca (talk) 15:24, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Malcolm X was not a head of state but he was highly influential in the cause of civil rights. The point is that history is not often corrected as it was here. 331dot (talk) 16:53, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – per Modest Genius.

Joseph2302 (talk) 20:40, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: Perhaps the blurb can mention the evacuation of thousands of residents and the destruction of infrastructure. Power outage and a small death toll won't cut it. --PFHLai (talk) 22:35, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Comment - this is quite a significant event in Canada, with reports that it could become the most expensive natural disaster in Canadian history [16], the death toll is expected to rise, along with wide ranging effects on supply chains and transportation networks. If I recall correctly, I think we did post the 2013 Alberta floods, for precedent. Connormah (talk) 22:39, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I guess "could be" is key here. If it does become the most expensive natural disaster after electing Trudeau in the history of Canada, then it's well placed for a blurb. Maybe now is premature. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:42, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Wait Living through this, it's a pretty devastating disaster, with all road access cut off to and from the Port of Vancouver, which is having a major impact on supply chains across Western Canada. But I don't think this meets the standard previously set for ITN just yet, although there are reports that the death toll is expected to rise. There's also reports of an imminent dike breach into a large city. As such, I'd suggest that we wait. NorthernFalcon (talk) 22:51, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – Lots of damage & dislocation but so far only one fatal. – Sca (talk) 23:29, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Wait If this gets worse and deadlier, then I will support.

Modest Genius talk 13:16, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Comment I would further comment that given Port of Vancouver is affected (the fourth largest port in North America by volume of goods) the supply chain issues are pretty notable. [17] CaffeinAddict (talk) 23:11, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, just “affected” the fourth in North America. Not America. Not even in the world. Let's not overestimate it. Storms are storms, and it happen...a lot of things. International impact is very low. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 01:52, 21 November 2021 (UTC) The discussion above is closed. Please do not modify it.

Please read the guidelines. Admin instructions are here. ??Skip to suggestions In the news toolbox Error reports Nominations (Archives) Discussion General criteria Death criteria Recurring items Admin guide Image protection Current events portal v t e Shortcut WP:ITN/C This page provides a forum for editors to suggest items for inclusion on In the news (ITN), a protected template on the Main Page, as well as the forum for discussion of candidates. This is not the page to report errors in the ITN section on the Main Page—please go to the appropriate section at WP:ERRORS. Archives of past nominations can be found here. This candidates page is integrated with the daily pages of Portal:Current events. Under each daily section header below is the transcluded Portal:Current events items for that day (with a light green header). Each day's portal page is followed by a subsection for suggestions and discussion. A blurb is a one sentence summary of the news story. An alternate suggestion for the blurb is called an altblurb, and any more suggestions get labelled alt1, alt2, etc. A blurb needs at least one target article, highlighted in bold; reviewers check the quality of that article and whether it is updated, and whether reliable sources demonstrate the significance of the event. Other articles can also be linked. The Ongoing line is for regularly updated articles which cover events that remain in the news over a longer period of time. RD stands for the "recent deaths" line, and can include any living thing whose death was recently announced. In some cases, recent deaths may need additional explanation as provided by a blurb; this is decided by consensus.

Ongoing: COVID-19 pandemic Recent deaths: Bill Virdon Peter Buck Doug Jones Cedric Robinson David Longdon Jay Last Nominate an article view — page history — related changes — edit How to nominate an item[edit] In order to suggest a candidate: Update an article to be linked to from the blurb to include the recent developments, or find an article that has already been updated. Find the correct section below for the date of the event (not the date nominated). Do not add sections for new dates. These are automatically generated (at midnight UTC) by a bot; creating them manually breaks this process. Nominate the blurb for ITN inclusion under the "Suggestions" subheading for the date, emboldening the link in the blurb to the updated article. Use a level 4 header (====) when doing so. Preferably use the template {{ITN candidate}} to nominate the article related to the event in the news. Make sure that you include a reference from a verifiable, reliable secondary source. Press releases are not acceptable. The suggested blurb should be written in simple present tense. Adding an explanation why the event should be posted greatly increases the odds of posting. Please consider alerting editors to the nomination by adding the template {{ITN note}} to the corresponding article's talk page. Purge this page to update the cache There are criteria which guide the decision on whether or not to put a particular item on In the news, based largely on the extensiveness of the updated content and the perceived significance of the recent developments. These are listed at WP:ITN. Submissions that do not follow the guidelines at Wikipedia:In the news will not be placed onto the live template. Headers[edit] Items that have been posted or pulled from the main page are generally marked with (Posted) or (Pulled) in the item's subject so it is clear they are no longer active. Items can also be marked as (Ready) when the article is both updated and there seems to be a consensus to post. The posting admin, however, should always judge the update and the consensus to post themselves. If you find an entry that you don't feel is ready to post is marked (Ready), you should remove the mark in the header. Voicing an opinion on an item[edit] Format your comment to contain "support" or "oppose", and include a rationale for your choice. In particular, address the notability of the event, the quality of the article, and whether it has been updated. Please do not...[edit] add simple "support!" or "oppose!" votes without including your reasons. Similarly, curt replies such as "who?", "meh", or "duh!" are usually not helpful. Instead, explain the reasons why you think the item meets or does not meet the ITN inclusion criteria so a consensus can be reached. oppose an item because the event is only relating to a single country, or failing to relate to one. This applies to a high percentage of the content we post and is unproductive. accuse other editors of supporting, opposing or nominating due to a personal bias (such as ethnocentrism).

(Radio Sweden) (Reuters) Murder of Ahmaud Arbery verdict[edit] Article: Murder of Ahmaud Arbery (talk · history · tag) Blurb: ?All three men, George McMichael, Travis McMichael, and William Bryan Jr., are found guilty in the Murder of Ahmaud Arbery (Post) News source(s): CNN, The New York Times BBC Credits: Nominated by Andise1 (talk · give credit) Article updated Nominator's comments: Ending to a major court case related to racial issues in the US. Andise1 (talk) 20:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Is it really necessary to discuss such a case again? I refer to here. Yet another case with zero international impact and interest, yet another case of a purely local trial. Far from being akin to the conviction for the murder of George Floyd. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 20:46, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Alsoriano97 If "international impact" was required for postings, very little would be posted. 331dot (talk) 20:47, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, but it should be much more decisive when it comes to court rulings than in other cases (sports, science, elections...). If the follow-up of a trial has a very low international coverage/interest, will you tell me that it's not an important requirement to take into account when determining whether a court case is blurb-worthy or not? So many people are condemned every day in this world... _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 20:58, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Respectfully, we aren't talking about someone convicted of robbing the corner store, but a black man who was murdered basically for being in the wrong neighborhood in a part of the United States where convictions for this sort of thing are rare. And as I said, this incident has influenced changes in laws. 331dot (talk) 21:55, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, laws of a single U.S. state (as far as I know). If it were at the federal level I might come to support it, but not at this one. And many are the events that trigger legislative changes. And without a doubt, the article is in excellent shape. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 22:35, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support. This was a highly followed trial in the US, and even before the verdict this incident resulted in changes in Georgia law(the elimination of citizens' arrests). 331dot (talk) 20:52, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Article is also of decent quality from what I can see. 331dot (talk) 20:57, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support -- this verdict is likely to influence future trials of this type in the United States, and it is an historic decision in an area of the country known for its virulent racism. I doubt a jury would have reached this verdict in that area even 20 years ago. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 21:47, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support High profile case with notable legal impact, quality article. SpencerT•C 21:55, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support. This is a newsworthy verdict, and the article is in good shape from a skim-through. -- Tavix (talk) 21:56, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose people found guilty of crime that they themselves were stupid enough to video. Seriously. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:18, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose It's gotten a lot of attention for emotional reasons, and on a human level the crime was shocking. But its long-term significance is likely to be minimal. People are murdered every day all over the world. Some get a lot of press attention. We almost never post them. -Ad Orientem (talk) 22:25, 24 November 2021 (UTC) It's already had long term significance, both legally and perhaps socially. This was not a garden variety murder. I don't understand this line of thinking more generally. If this event is not notable due to not having "long term significance", it should be proposed for deletion. 331dot (talk) 22:31, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Not at all, there does exist a middle ground between ITN and AFD. This is a prime example. It's the result of a clear-cut murder case which the perps videoed themselves. A no-brainer. What would have been newsworthy would have been this ending in a non-guilty verdict and the no-doubt ensuing riots. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:34, 24 November 2021 (UTC) They taped it because they were in their mind attempting to make a citizens arrest(which was banned after this incident) even though they had no evidence of a crime. And in Georgia and elsewhere this is, rightly or wrongly, not clear cut. Even 15 years ago these men might have got off. And there was doubt Derek Chauvin would be convicted for killing George Floyd even though that was on video. 331dot (talk) 22:45, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, it's nuanced and emotive but ultimately it's just another crime story. It's been whipped up with publicity and is precisely the reason that we need to apply some common sense to these kinds of nominations. It is of minimal long term significance. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:49, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support Article is in good shape, well referenced, and story is currently being adequately covered by reliable sources. Meets all requirements. --Jayron32 22:38, 24 November 2021 (UTC) English channel disaster[edit] Article: November 2021 English Channel disaster (talk · history · tag) Blurb: ?31 people die whilst crossing the English channel (Post) Alternative blurb: ?31 people die whilst crossing the English channel, in the channel's worst disaster in modern times News source(s): https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/world/calais-migrant-drowning-is-worst-ever-in-english-channel-official-says/ar-AAR5RlY https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/11/24/20-migrants-die-boat-capsizes-channel-near-calais/ Credits: Nominated by Llewee (talk · give credit) Nominator's comments: Article needs work but clearly a serious incident which should be posted once the page is ready Llewee (talk) 18:54, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Wait ... pending development of article, now a 150-word stub, more than half reactions.

If there have been significant updates in the last week, these should be added, but right now, this article fails the ongoing criteria. In particular, the last significant update is older than the day of the oldest ITN event (21 November), which is a general rule for something not being updated enough for Ongoing. Joseph2302 (talk) 12:26, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Remove. I think Belarus cleared out migrants from the border; Putin must think he made his point. 331dot (talk) 12:28, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Remove. The migrants have been moved away from the border and the situation has calmed down. No longer an ongoing event. Modest Genius talk 13:05, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – Although the situation appears to have been at least partially defused, there have been reports in recent days that in some cases Belorussian guards have continued to help migrants breach the border into Polish territory. [1], [2] [3] – Sca (talk) 13:27, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Remove the existence of news coverage that Sca notes is a necessary but not sufficient condition for maintaining an ongoing link. The article also needs to have been continuously updated. That clearly didn't happen here. --Jayron32 20:06, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – I have read the reports mentioned by Sca. It appears as if the situation have slowed down, but not ended. So still Ongoing.BabbaQ (talk) 20:23, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Removed.

(Post) Alternative blurb: ?Following the resignation of Stefan Löfven, Magdalena Andersson (pictured) is elected by the Riksdag as the first female Prime Minister of Sweden. Alternative blurb II: ?Magdalena Andersson (pictured) is elected as the first female Prime Minister of Sweden. News source(s): BBC Credits: Nominated by BastianMAT (talk · give credit) Article updated The nominated event is listed on WP:ITN/R, so each occurrence is presumed to be important enough to post. Comments should focus on whether the quality of the article and update meet WP:ITNCRIT, not the significance. Nominator's comments: ITNR, as it falls under "Changes in the holder of the office which administer the executive of their respective state/government, in those countries which qualify under the criteria above, as listed at List of current heads of state and government except when that change was already posted as part of a general election". First female prime minister of Sweden. BastianMAT (talk) 09:59, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment she takes office on the 26th (according to her article). Until that point, the blurb isn't correct, as she only becomes the first female PM of Sweden on that date. Is it usual to post when it's announced, or when they take office? Joseph2302 (talk) 10:04, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Usually when they are elected but yeah with the blurb of being elected. BastianMAT (talk) 10:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support - First female PM in Sweden. But change blurb to ”is elected” instead becomes.BabbaQ (talk) 10:06, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Yes. BastianMAT (talk) 10:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support Significant as new PM and first female. Perhaps the blub should be "elected by the Riksdag" since she didn't gain office through a normal election (by the people). cart-Talk 10:15, 24 November 2021 (UTC) That's normal in a parliamentary system. – Sca (talk) 15:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment The blurb should probably start with "Following the resignation of Stefan Löfven, ..." to provide context, since this was not an election outcome but a government reshuffle. --Tone 10:20, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support now the blurb has been changed to "is elected" seems fine to run now. Agree with Tone that we should make it clearer that this wasn't an election that caused this. Joseph2302 (talk) 11:01, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support Her article looks great, is ITNR and altblurb, although somewhat long, it's the most complete and clear of all. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 11:31, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Posting. --Tone 11:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Would suggest that we use the image of Andersson at the front page.BabbaQ (talk) 11:49, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Agree with this, we usually use the image for the newest blurb. Joseph2302 (talk) 14:32, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Post-posting support This is historic. -TenorTwelve (talk) 14:30, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Since Sweden's in the EU, perhaps she'll become the next Merkel. – Sca (talk) 15:25, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Then again, maybe not. – Sca (talk) 20:01, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Update by the nominator Things are looking bad for her and her party now. The Center Party (liberal) voted for the opposition’s budget and it got through. The Center party did not agree with the goverment’s budget, stating it was way too left. That would mean Magdallena now has to rule with right wing economic politics, which she accepted. However their junior party the Green party did not accept it and have left the goverment meaning a new Riksdag election for the prime minister post shall be held. Interesting development. SVT BastianMAT (talk) 16:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Update 2 by nominator Magdallena Andersson has officially resigned. We might have to pull the news back as she won’t be assuming office. She will only assume office if she wins a new prime minister vote, which might take place in a few days/weeks, depending on how the talks with the speaker goes. SVT BastianMAT (talk) 16:46, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Pull (or update the blurb). Her resignation is quickly making international news. 142.182.136.105 (talk) 17:38, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Update blurb Move over Kim Campbell, there's a new sheriff in town. Or more precisely, there was one for a few hours.Scaramouche33 (talk) 17:58, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Pull until it's confirmed whether she will now be the leader or not. Joseph2302 (talk) 18:01, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose pull What is ITNR is that a few hours ago she has been elected by the Swedish parliament. However much she has resigned. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 18:20, 24 November 2021 (UTC) What updating with "and immediately resigns" or something? This is a really weird sequence of events. --Tone 18:21, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Pull - The blurb, as it currently stands, is false.--WaltCip-(talk) 18:50, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Updated to Magdalena Andersson (pictured), shortly after being elected as the first female prime minister of Sweden, resigns. Any further changes, please? --PFHLai (talk) 19:13, 24 November 2021 (UTC) I think this is fine now. --Tone 19:25, 24 November 2021 (UTC) I'm not a big fan of blurbs that contemplate the resignation of a prime minister...But knowing a bit of precedent, it's very likely that in a few days/weeks she will be re-elected, as happened with Löfven in the middle of this year. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 19:48, 24 November 2021 (UTC) For the record, I support this new blurb. It will work until she is finally elected the new PM in a few days or at the longest a week.BabbaQ (talk) 20:21, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks. Hopefully, we'll have an update about her taking office soon. That would be a simple update to do. --PFHLai (talk) 20:31, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Pull -- wait until she actually is seated. She just resigned. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 21:22, 24 November 2021 (UTC) The blurb already says that. It's fine. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 21:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) It's probably just my own bias here; but it seems silly to post this when she just resigned. Forming coalition governments in a parliamentary system is weird. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 21:45, 24 November 2021 (UTC) It's a fascinating and encyclopedic story. Unlike the myriad legal cases being spewed out of the US these days.

But it's in the news now. Andrew?(talk) 08:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support important mission with global implications, good article. Polyamorph (talk) 08:18, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment. This may be notable as the first mission of its type (to post now); it will be ITNR when it arrives as well. Just saying. 331dot (talk) 08:19, 24 November 2021 (UTC) This may be ITN/R per "first ... launches of any type of rocket" as it's the first mission to use the NEXT drive but that's debatable. Andrew?(talk) 10:09, 24 November 2021 (UTC) The NEXT is the thruster on the spacecraft, not the rocket that put it up there(a Falcon 9). 331dot (talk) 12:31, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Such missions usually have multiple stages and each stage has separate rocket engines. The first stage is usually more spectacular but there's no scientific reason to prefer it. For deep space missions lasting years, the efficiency of the final spacecraft will be most important and this is a new design. Andrew?(talk) 12:54, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support important global mission (even if it does sound like DART is copying the plot of Salvation (TV series)). Added 3 cn tags to article, but apart from that, it looks more than good enough article quality for the front page. Joseph2302 (talk) 09:13, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support Everyone in the world should be happy we'll finally have a way to stop any doomsday asteroids from wiping us all out. Dream Focus 11:15, 24 November 2021 (UTC) If it works, of course... _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 11:39, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support is ITNR from what Andrew says and the global impact of this mission is undoubted, so it's clearly notable. In fact I think it should be one of the most important scientific news of the year. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 11:39, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Global impact?? I thought the idea was to avoid that! Martinevans123 (talk) 13:52, 24 November 2021 (UTC) This event can't be notable, its only impact is on a small unpopulated asteroid! WaltCip-(talk) 14:17, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Impactfulness nonapparent at this pt. in time & space. – Sca (talk) 15:00, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment the proposed blurb is a mess. I've added alt1, though for some reason that's messing up the template formatting - I can't work out why. Modest Genius talk 13:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Also, this is not ITNR, as it's not a new type of rocket and interplanetary probes are ITNR when they arrive at their destination, not when launched. But the gap here is long enough (ten months) that it's reasonable to post both launch and arrival. Modest Genius talk 13:15, 24 November 2021 (UTC) @Modest Genius: I fixed the formatting issue. Adding italics to either of the blurbs breaks it, because italics are already applied by default.--WaltCip-(talk) 13:26, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks. Modest Genius talk 13:44, 24 November 2021 (UTC) The fact that the mission is attempting to alter the course of the asteroid makes this particularly notable. Added alt2.

Joseph2302 (talk) 08:35, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Not terrorism, according to "sources", so whilst tragic, it appears to be a worse-than-usual crime gone wrong. Black Kite (talk) 08:44, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support -- It seems that around five people died in the attack. The perpetrator has been reported by a few media outlets as Daniel Brooks, a black man who raps under the name "MathboiFly" and has tons of social media posts supporting BLM, and this was in the aftermath of a very notable event where Rittenhouse was cleared as killing two black men in self-defence. OldPeace7068 (talk) 09:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Complete extrapolation. Police have said they believe he was on the run having committed a separate crime, nothing to do with Rittenhouse at all. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 09:35, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Wikipedia is there to report the facts. Police and many members of the public initially considered the possibility of Islamic terrorism due to similar incidents in the past involving Muslims, the targeting of a western festival, and the recent rise in Islamic terrorist activity, but police have now confirmed that this is not terrorism related. Similarly, there have been widespread links/controversy made between the rapper and his connections to BLM, and it has been linked to Rittenhouse whether you like it or not. It is part of the story. The killer is a major supporter and activist of BLM. And this happened in the aftermath of Rittenhouse's acquittal. It's all part of the background and developing story. OldPeace7068 (talk) 09:45, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Not at all. The police have stated he was fleeing a separate scene. Conflating this with BLM/Rittenhouse is pure crystal balling. Thanks. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 09:47, 22 November 2021 (UTC) "two black men" and you'd think we were on a website about facts... CharredWaffle (talk) 14:04, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. Calling this an "attack" may be a misnomer as it appears that the suspect was fleeing the police, not that it was a preplanned attack or terrorism. 331dot (talk) 12:50, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Maybe so. OTOH, at least one report quotes a witness as saying the vehicle seemed to be "targeting people" as it veered from side to side. Also, reports say it crashed through barriers to reach the parade, which seems to indicate that it was indeed an attack, though possibly not a pre-planned one. – Sca (talk) 16:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment The blurb should (and currently does not) mention the country in which this event took place. Chrisclear (talk) 12:56, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose - It's not at all clear that this is an act of terrorism, and thus not something that would be imminently notable.--WaltCip-(talk) 13:09, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose both on merit and article quality. As of this comment, the incident does not appear to have been a deliberate attack. I would be open to reconsideration if contrary information comes to light.

This doesn't mean motiveless events can't ever be posted but I would expect the results to be more devasting (like the various major building fires or collapses that we had). --Masem (t) 16:36, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Exactly, I think the same Masem. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 17:30, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Wait – As an AP update seems to suggest this was the act of a lone nutcase with a record, I've withdrawn my provisonal support.

If the toll were to rise to double digits, we might still want to consider a blurb about this very nasty event. – Sca (talk) 18:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support if the motivation turns out to be terrorism, neutral if otherwise. Mlb96 (talk) 19:04, 22 November 2021 (UTC) A post – by an IT user with no other contributions – on our article's talk page posits racial motivation.

This event is in the news and the article looks to be in good shape. -- Tavix (talk) 19:38, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: – Since perp's been ID'd & police say he'll face five counts of first-degree intentional homicide, this is looking potentially more significant. – Sca (talk) 20:02, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Per The Independent this guy had a domestic dispute, and drove his car like a lunatic. Not terror-related, just an idiot behind the wheel. Not significant, tragic, but will never make the top 1000 things that happened on Planet Earth in 2021, let alone the top 250. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support - a mass-casualty event, receiving international coverage (e.g., BBC), a suspect is being charged, and the article has been improved to sufficient quality. Levivich 20:04, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support - rare (even in the US) mass-casualty event. Article quality is decent. Destroyeraa (Alternate account) 20:28, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment a road traffic accident in the US is not rare. Mass-casualty events in the US are far from rare. It's pretty obvious that giving this tragic yet non-terrorist/non-BLM/non-protest/non-deliberate accident undue prominence is not what the encyclopedia was designed to do. Of course, you can dig into the BBC website and find coverage, it's all "shock and think of the children" in the US, but the rest of the world has moved on the moment it was clear it was a sad instance of a crime somewhere else having shitty side-effects, and literally nothing more. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) The last time I remember a similar incident happened in the US was late 2017 when somebody plowed into a crowd in Virginia after a violent demonstration got broken up. We posted the event that it was tangentially related to, largely on the strength of somebody plowing their car into a crowd and killing someone. You supported posting it. Rockphed (talk) 01:03, 23 November 2021 (UTC) If you're referring to Charlottesville car attack, that was about a man deliberately setting out to ram people. This is about a man trying to escape the scene of a domestic incident and getting into a road traffic accident. The two are incomparable. But good try. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 08:07, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Agreeing with previous posters, posting this event would seem to be giving undue weight to a tragic traffic accident. Comparison with the Charlottesville incident from several years back is unfair, given the explicitly political motivations of the earlier event. Wizardoftheyear (talk) 01:17, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Neutral and Wait Yes, with the additional details that have come to light, this is literally a domestic issue that had decidedly more tragic consequences. However, that is additional details. The initial response, and the fact there were several fatalities during a celebration, caught on camera and shared around the world before anyone knew what was going on, has made this major news and a source of intrigue. I think we need to wait to see if the news stations drop their coverage now that there is less intrigue and crisis; if it has effectively left the news cycle by end of day, take this as an oppose, but if it is still on the news banners, take this as support. Kingsif (talk) 01:42, 23 November 2021 (UTC) 4 of the 12 paragraphs in this article start "On November 2X". Typical anti-American bias from the Brits (which is far from rare) notwithstanding, the quality is not there yet. GreatCaesarsGhost 02:23, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Support - Tragic, criminally-induced mass-casualty. Significant details are now known. CoatCheck (talk) 03:03, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Wait It's very clear that there won't be consensus as is, but there may be more of one as things develop. Wait for now. DarkSide830 (talk) 03:46, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Strong Support. This is the deadliest vehicle ramming incident in the United States or Canada since 2018 and the deadliest in the US since 2017. 142.182.136.105 (talk) 07:37, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Comment I see there's been a tragic bus crash in Bulgaria which has killed at least 45 people. It would be safe to presume that supporters of this accident would support the posting of the Bulgarian crash, right? The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 08:09, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Nominate an article on it so that I can assess the quality. Without knowing what we are posting on the main page, it is impossible for me to know if the article is appropriate. --Jayron32 12:56, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Four hours ago....

Leaning toward support, for all the diff that would make here. – Sca (talk) 13:49, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Support for multiple fatalities, high number of serious injuries, and widespread news coverage. Jehochman Talk 13:50, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose A tragic event, but it is not a mass-casualty event. ArsenalGhanaPartey (talk) 14:11, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Comment - We have support and oppose !votes that directly contradict each other in terms of the notability of this event. Some say this is very notable. Others say this is not at all notable. How is an admin supposed to derive consensus from this? --WaltCip-(talk) 15:05, 23 November 2021 (UTC) By executive fiat. – Sca (talk) 15:44, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Well most of the support votes are from Americans (of those who have userpages), and almost all of the opposes are from non-Americans. So I guess it'll be a coin toss on whether an American or non-American admin decides...

This at first got attention because it might have been terrorism related, no problem there. But all we are left with now is an accident which leaves 5 death: while tragic, this is sadly an everyday occurrence. We have e.g. this week a ferry accident in Sri Lanka (at least 6 death)[5], 7 death in Greece when migrants flee the police[6], 22 deaths on Lake Kivu[7], nine deaths in a fire in Bulgaria[8], 10 deaths in China after a car crash[9], ... I see no reason to post this, as it is not exceptional, has no lasting importance, and isn't even very interesting (without the terrorism angle). It's a sad tragedy, but a very common one. Fram (talk) 17:03, 23 November 2021 (UTC) I think it is WP:TOOSOON to make a determination as to whether this was an act of terror or not. Terrorism or not, the ramming appears to be deliberate, and it has made national and international headlines. Aasim (talk) 06:53, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. Per Fram, tragic, but not significant enough at a global scale: we don't even have articles about many similar tragedies elsewhere. Vanamonde (Talk) 17:45, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose.

Major election in an EU member state. – Illegitimate Barrister (talk • contribs), 02:46, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Question Do we post presidential elections even if the president has mostly symbolic roles? Scaramouche33 (talk) 07:32, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, heads of state elections are posted even if they are ceremonial/wield little power, it mostly depends on the article quality itself which should be more than sufficient. Two examples are the Italian presidental election and Czech presidental election, both having similar powers to the Bulgarian one. [10] [11] BastianMAT (talk) 09:02, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Weak support this article has been on front page for a week already, but I guess the second round presidency vote means that it's ITN eligible again. Article looks to have been sufficiently updated about the presidential second round vote. Joseph2302 (talk) 12:10, 22 November 2021 (UTC) This is not ITNR. We no longer post all elections for head of state- we post the election/choosing of the official with actual executive power, according to List of current heads of state and government; in Bulgaria that is the PM, not the president. 331dot (talk) 12:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) In which case, I oppose this nomination, and it shouldn't have been tagged as ITNR. Joseph2302 (talk) 12:37, 22 November 2021 (UTC) In fairness, it is a recent change that not everyone may be aware of. 331dot (talk) 12:41, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Alright, I thought going by older posts that head of state elections are still part of ITNR but if its been removed, no problem and thanks for the headsup for future nominations. BastianMAT (talk) 12:46, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I just saw this now. I must have missed the change or forgot about it. So my comment on other presidents is not relevant here. --Tone 17:49, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Exactly, that’s what got me confused to when I ITNR nominated this. In the past as you and I mentioned, similar head of state elections (with similar powers) such as Moldova(November 2020), Germany, Austria, Italy, Czech Republic have been posted. 331dot said the removal of ceremonial head of state elections from ITNR were ’recently’ done, so the change must have not been too long ago for us to not know that.BastianMAT (talk) 18:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Blurb on MainPage was updated and moved up --PFHLai (talk) 13:11, 22 November 2021 (UTC) PFHLai there wasn't consensus to do this update- the presidential election is not ITNR, and there was not consensus here that it's important enough for ITN. We should leave it where it is, so it can roll off soon, instead of moving it up so it'll stay on ITN for another week... Joseph2302 (talk) 13:27, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Post posting support If the election was stand-alone, we would probably post it. This is just the case where the general election were held together with the first round of presidential, so there is a single article. I don't see a problem. --Tone 14:56, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I doubt we would post this as a standalone item. He may be head of state, but he has no power. It's the Prime Minister of Bulgaria who would be posted automatically.  — Amakuru (talk) 17:18, 22 November 2021 (UTC) In fact he has been in de facto power since the 2021 April elections as he appointed his friend as acting prime minister. The de jure power he wields is similar to those in Italy and Czech Republic, where he gets to nominate the prime minister and supreme court judges, he can veto laws (although parliament can override) and he of course serves as head of state, don’t forget Bulgaria even has a vice president. In the past we have posted the Italian presidental and Czech Republic presidental elections, both are parliamantary republics too. I thought it was ITNR, but 331dot mentioned that head of state elections (where the head of state is not head of goverment) was recently removed from ITNR. Italian presidental election posted Czech Republic presidental election posted BastianMAT (talk) 17:32, 22 November 2021 (UTC) (ec) As far as I remember we post both if the articles are ok. We've posted presidents of Austria and Germany, which have a similar role, for example. Furthermore, the president of Germany is elected by Bundestag, not by a popular vote. --Tone 17:36, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Pull update and Revert back to previous version per Joseph2302. This guy is just a figure head, and we already posted the main election result. There was no reason to have bumped this up, and the result is not ITN/R so needs consensus, which it doesn't have.  — Amakuru (talk) 17:14, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Pull update and agree with above, not seeing consensus here for this to have even been posted in the first instance. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 17:21, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Beyond the issue of whether it should be on the main page, the blurb is clumsy. "In Bulgaria," is redundant. Where else but in Bulgaria would you be elected President of Bulgaria? Schwede66 17:57, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Restored old blurb. --PFHLai (talk) 18:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose pull Not a head of state change but in the same spirit This post was made by orbitalbuzzsaw gang (talk) 19:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment I think we need some kind of page break to restart voting. A lot of the opposition above was to the unilateral action and not the nom itself. as for me, Oppose while there are some states with significant power invested in the secondary office, this is not one of them. GreatCaesarsGhost 21:55, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I didn't particularly mind about the unilateral action myself - it was made in good faith - and my oppose is purely on the merits of the case, for much the same reasons as you.

Article: Peng Shuai (talk · history · tag) Blurb: ?Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai disappears after accusing a former Chinese Vice Premier of sexual assault. (Post) Alternative blurb: ?Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai is reported missing after accusing former Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli of sexual assault. News source(s): Guardian Credits: Nominated by Blythwood (talk · give credit) Article updatedNominator's comments: Seems to be a forced disappearance. This is a bit unusual, but has been a major news story. Disappearance section seems solid but the rest of the article on her career is less well sourced. The person has disappeared without a trace, so while it cannot be verified that this person person has died or been imprisoned, her disappearance is in itself the notable event. I wonder if this could be treated as something like the equivalent of a recent death. Blythwood (talk) 22:39, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support - Article is in good condition and the news is prominent, exceptional, and of great public interest around the world. Jehochman Talk 22:45, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose - Article appear in news, but headlines on CBC, CNN, BBC are still focused on Rittenhouse Trial for now, although this may change. Otherwise, the blurb should describe whats happening now (the reactions), that she has not been publicly heard is not ITN as that is a few days old. 99.247.176.90 (talk) 23:06, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose - I fail to see how this is any more worthy of ITN than the Rittenhouse trial, which was also not worthy of ITN. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 23:10, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Please don't oppose because you think another nomination should be posted and you don't think this one is as worthy. Judge nomination on its own merit. The two are about completely different things. -- KTC (talk) 23:12, 19 November 2021 (UTC) I don't think either are worthy of being posted. --RockstoneSend me a message! 01:20, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support per Jehochman. However I'm not quite sure about the term "disappears" here, even if I personally think the Chinese state did exactly that. -- KTC (talk) 23:16, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support per Jehochman. -- Tavix (talk) 23:20, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support this is far more notable than "another white American kills black Americans" and regardless of the fact that headlines are currently obsessing over the US proclivity to allow kids to routinely assassinate people without any kind of criminal conviction, Peng's disappearance is genuinely newsworthy and encyclopedic. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 23:23, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Not that it matters to this nomination, but Rittenhouse's victims were white. GreatCaesarsGhost 00:04, 20 November 2021 (UTC) *cough cough* Rittenhouse's victims were white *cough cough* – John M Wolfson (talk • contribs) 00:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Who said he wasn't talking about Young Dolph's routine assassin? We don't know he wasn't white. We don't know if he had other black American victims. Memphis is all about unsolved mysteries! AGF. InedibleHulk (talk) 02:06, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose on quality The article needs a lot of work, as there are multiple sections with no inline citations.Pawnkingthree (talk) 23:42, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support While this might be unduly implicative of the Chinese state being connected, if RSs are making that connection this definitely belongs. – John M Wolfson (talk • contribs) 00:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose on quality I would support this if the article has some ref work done. There's sections that are unsourced. --TDKR Chicago 101 (talk) 00:34, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose this is newsworthy for sure but blurbing that someone "disappeared" after making an accusation seems like a WP:BLPCRIME issue to me. --LaserLegs (talk) 00:39, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Completely agree it's an awkward thing to summarise in a way that fits BLP while keeping it clear why the event is notable, I'd welcome suggestions for alternative phrasing. I realise this is a fairly limited action, but for that reason I deliberately didn't link to the person she accused in the proposed blurb. Blythwood (talk) 01:57, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose as per LaserLegs, there's something wrong about posting speculation that someone disappeared straight after they made accusations. With little reliable information, this seems like a BLP issue to post it. Joseph2302 (talk) 01:47, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Far too speculative, with overtones of anti-China sentiment, and with too many unknowns. Needs far more clarification before it is posted. And a guarantee that ITN will publish a full We Were Wrong! statement and retraction on the Main page when it is found out she has just eloped with her boyfriend or girlfriend, as the case may be. HiLo48 (talk) 01:55, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Clearly if China "disappeared" her, that would be a story, but this appears to be Western nations making a demand of China and there's no hard evidence she has been killed or imprisoned or the like. We don't post this type of speculative stories. --Masem (t) 02:16, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support Per wide coverage in RSes. Normchou?? 03:22, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose unless the incident has a separate article. Sun8908?Talk 07:38, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support — article looks decent enough for ITN standards by my eye, wide coverage in RSes. If the choice of "disappears" is undesirable, then "is reported missing" might be a potential alternative (posted as altblurb). [osunpokeh/talk/contributions] 08:41, 20 November 2021 (UTC) I think that suggests she was reported missing in the police report sense, not that Novak Djokovic described her as "a missing person" to reporters. Not a bad idea. Just a bit ambiguous. InedibleHulk (talk) 09:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Strong support, in the news, top page news in many countries. The issue is she has suddenly disappeared after accusing a senior cabinet minister of a serious crime, and the involved parties are public figures indept of this incident, so there is nothing wrong as long as it is sourced and not stated as truth. Peng's disappearance and the resulting sports diplomacy pressure and boycott threats are sufficient Bumbubookworm (talk) 12:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Have you ever studied the difference between correlation and causation? HiLo48 (talk) 21:48, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Yes I have and I wonder if it's possible to have a maths competition over Wikipedia lol. I never said there was a causation, although I am sure many on Wikipedia have noted your hard-left POV eg trying to get all right of centre Australian newspapers struck off at RSN. Bumbubookworm (talk) 22:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Applause. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:33, 20 November 2021 (UTC) I am adding sources to the career section Bumbubookworm (talk) 12:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – Per Masem, Joseph2302. Something that may have happened isn't blurbworthy, no matter how widely it's hyped. – Sca (talk) 13:05, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose per Masem, Sca. It could be the start of something noteworthy, or it could be nothing. We can post when it turns out to be something noteworthy if it does. Usedtobecool ?? 13:23, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support - Do we post news around here anymore? Sometimes I do wonder.--WaltCip-(talk) 18:40, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support highly notable, good article. Polyamorph (talk) 20:03, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support per above. The article has unref'd sections about her tennis career, but the linked section is ready. Davey2116 (talk) 21:52, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. We shouldn't (and don't) post articles with multiple unsourced sections. The fact that the section linked in bold is referenced is irrelevant. Black Kite (talk) 23:26, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Wait Let's wait until we are 100% sure what has happened to her. Heythereimaguy (talk) 23:53, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Global Times continues to point to her, this time at a restaurant with a coach and friends, seemingly quite visible. Western speculation now turns to whether she's safe, though, or free from external interference or to be believed. All very personal and hard-to-answer questions, for anybody anywhere. InedibleHulk (talk) 00:10, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose it's just one person in a world where much worse things happen in other places like Ethiopia. Banedon (talk) 01:11, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose for now. Videos of Peng Shuai have supposedly surfaced. Nice4What (talk · contribs) – (Thanks ?) 03:30, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Support However, I propose removing the term 'Chinese' in front of Peng Shuai. It does not add to her character or her identity as a professional tennis player. Something along the lines of "Professional tennis player Peng Shuai disappears after accusing former Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli of sexual assault." would be better imo. However, we should also note the videos posted by Global Times editors (primarily those tweeted by editor-in-chief Hu Xijin) and their aftermath. JMonkey2006 (talk) 11:10, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – She's reappeared, online at least. End of story? – Sca (talk) 13:34, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Strong support Wide coverage by RSes and notable. Fakescientist8000 (talk) 14:05, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Still too murky and speculative, with little general impact. – Sca (talk) 15:24, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Leaving aside anything else, there is video evidence of her out and about so she hasn't been "disappeared" and isn't "missing". Whether or not something else is happening is in the realm of speculation, and would require a separate blurb. Also, very large swathes of the article on her career lack even a single citation. Is it not time to close this as no consensus already? Preceding posted by User:BSMRD – Sca (talk) 17:35, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: – Discussion tops 1,500 words. Posts running 4:3 against. – Sca (talk) 17:42, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Comment as nominator I'm willing to close soon now there's video of her alive (barring any big development, like it rapidly emerging this is an impersonator). Someone being in big trouble with their government isn't ITN-worthy, although I still think someone being forced-disappeared could be.

A few WP:PROSELINE-issues, but not enough to downgrade the quality too much. Topic has been, and is being covered extensively by quality, reliable news sources in a way that would indicate this is a significant story. Checks all of the boxes for me. --Jayron32 18:55, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose to international notability. It won’t be listed on 2021 per previous discussions of it not having international notability. Elijahandskip (talk) 19:02, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Elijahandskip, #Please do not... oppose an item because the event is only relating to a single country, or failing to relate to one. This applies to a high percentage of the content we post and is unproductive. – Muboshgu (talk) 19:04, 19 November 2021 (UTC) (edit conflict):*See the instructions above "Please do not...oppose an item because the event is only relating to a single country, or failing to relate to one. This applies to a high percentage of the content we post and is unproductive." "International notability" is not a criteria for posting at ITN, nor has it ever been. --Jayron32 19:05, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Well my direct opinion is that it is not notable. My reasoning is the discussion that already took place on the 2021 talk page. I also have previous discussions months ago where things highly notable to one country aren’t included. Elijahandskip (talk) 19:11, 19 November 2021 (UTC) This is not a discussion of the page 2021. The criteria established for other parts of Wikipedia don't apply here. If you wish to change the criteria used for the ITN box, then start a discussion at WT:ITN. Votes without valid rationales are given little weight. It's fine if you have a useful rationale, but merely "I don't think it's notable enough" does not provide any useful guidance to admins when deciding consensus. I mean, you're allowed to say any silly thing you want, I suppose, but you can't expect anyone to take you seriously if it isn't valid. --Jayron32 19:18, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Well since you don’t like my reasoning, just let me say “no”. People have supported ITN’s in the past without giving a reason, so my “Oppose” in this case will not have a reason. Elijahandskip (talk) 19:22, 19 November 2021 (UTC) As I said, it's a free world. People do nonsensical things all of the time. --Jayron32 19:24, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Yep, I couldn’t agree more. In reality, my oppose on this comes more to combat American Wikipedia vs English Wikipedia. There is a essay on Wikipedia that I recently read that has that meaning. Not everything that happens in America is notable for Wikipedia/2021/ITN/Portal Current Events, etc….Elijahandskip (talk) 19:34, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose (at least on news of just the verdict). It was a highly watched case in the U.S., but it was clear early on to many legal experts that are crying foul on judicial behavior. It is very very likely to see an appeal and so this is not the end. This is not like the result from the very public George Floyd protests (which we posted and had ongoing about those, and the verdict). That said, there had been concerns there may be rioting following an acquittal , and while I'm not seeing any immediate news on that, a major riot (akin to the LA riots after King's verdict) would likely be the newsworthy factor here. --Masem (t) 19:05, 19 November 2021 (UTC) There literally cannot be any appeal of a not guilty verdict. This is a core principle of how double jeopardy is handled in American jurisprudence. A not guilty jury verdict is basically always final. See [12]. There are some exceedingly rare exceptions to this, but none of them would apply in this case. An ordinary jury verdict of "not guilty" like this one (even in a controversial trial) is treated as basically sacrosanct, and there can be no appeals by the government. --Jayron32 19:08, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Except for the calls for a mistrial that are being entered now. I know there's complexities with double jeopardy there, but that's still on the books and that itself can be a legal process. --Masem (t) 19:15, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Um, what? There were calls for a mistrial by Rittenhouse's defense team prior to the jury verdict coming back. Now that the verdict is in their client's favor, I doubt highly they will press forward with these requests. Indeed, articles such as this one note "The verdict also meant that Judge Bruce Schroeder did not have to rule on the defense's motions for a mistrial." --Jayron32 19:23, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose as above. If we had to have an American court psychodrama today, the better option from a world-historical perspective would probably be the acquittal of the purported killers of Malcolm X. —Brigade Piron (talk) 19:20, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose AGF, but this is such a small story in the grand scheme. GreatCaesarsGhost 19:23, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Wait. It is too early to tell what impact this will have. It could be a Rodney King-like result where acquittal of the accused leads to broad social unrest, or it could pass with a shrug. I expect that we will know within 24 hours. BD2412 T 19:30, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose and close US-centric nomination, not important enough for ITN.

Far from blurb-worthy, lack of deep international coverage and interest. U.S-centric. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 19:58, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Very US centric. It's probably not even the most important news in the US right now, let alone the world. I agree with Piron above that the clearing of Malcom X's killers is more noteworthy in the grand scheme. CaptainEek Edits Ho Cap'n!? 20:32, 19 November 2021 (UTC) It is the most important US news event ongoing right now.

(Post) News source(s): AP, WSJ Credits: Nominated by Indefensible (talk · give credit) Updated by Dracophyllum (talk · give credit) and DiplomatTesterMan (talk · give credit) Nominator's comments: This article was previously in ongoing, now has a noteworthy update which should bring it towards conclusion. - Indefensible (talk) 06:50, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: One of the major farmers' unions behind the protests, Bharatiya Kisan Union, has promised to continue protesting till the laws are actually repealed (source). I wonder if we should put this blurb up now, or when Parliament repeals them and the farmers go home (don't have strong opinions either way, but I lean towards waiting). If we're going to put it up now, I've uploaded this screengrab of Modi's announcement from his CC-BY YouTube channel; we could use it. Btw Indefensible - Dracophyllum was the only updater, not DiplomatTesterMan. Kind regards, W. Tell DCCXLVI (talk to me!/c) 07:05, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Using the update to put back in ongoing instead of a final blurb would be fine too if preferable. And DiplomatTesterMan did more updates on the article before that, he still deserves some credit too I think. - Indefensible (talk) 07:12, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose because the article is not sufficiently updated. There is currently a 1 sentence mention in the lead of the repeal of the laws, and no mention of it, nor of any follow-on protests, anywhere in the body of the article. Before this can be posted, the latest developments would need to be added to the article appropriately. --Jayron32 12:18, 19 November 2021 (UTC) @Jayron32 Have you read the repeal section? Dracophyllum 20:10, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Your response is 8 hours after Jayron32's, Dracophyllum. The section may have not existed when Jayron commented. But then again, I am not going to take the time to check if it did exist at 12:18 PM UTC on 19 Nov 2021. Tube·of·Light 02:30, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: The announcement by itself has no legal value. Parliament has to repeal the laws, which it will probably do in the coming Winter Session. Also some farmer's unions are continuing protests until the laws are repealed and minimum support prices reconsidered. So it might be better to wait, but no strong opinion either way. --Jose Mathew (talk) 12:24, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Wait and see what the impact of this is.

India-centric nomination, not important enough for ITN and renominate once the riots get into full swing. per above. Far from blurb-worthy, lack of deep international coverage and interest. India-centric Very India centric. It's probably not even the most important news in India right now, let alone the world. Actually not even sure this is going to be more than a couple days' news in India "Please do not oppose an item because the event is only relating to a single country, or failing to relate to one. This applies to a high percentage of the content we post and is unproductive." 331dot (talk) 23:11, 19 November 2021 (UTC) It's important to remember that 1/7 of the people on this planet are Indians. We don’t post a great deal of India related stories. 331dot (talk) 23:13, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Interestingly I didn't see the same PDM feedback from you above for another "country-centric" nomination from the worlds third most populous country. In fact, we do post many India-centric stories here, this one having festered in ongoing for nearly a year. --LaserLegs (talk) 23:36, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support. Invariably it is announcements that get more attention than the actual act, most of the time(we post elections when the result is known, not when the results are official/certified). If Modi renegs, that will likely be newsworthy itself. 331dot (talk) 23:16, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Weak oppose - as Wilhelm Tell DCCXLVI says, the BKU is still protesting. I would prefer waiting till the laws are actually repealed (and FWIW, these laws are being repealed just before the 2022 Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly elections and elections in some other states, which are crucial for Modi's political party). Tube·of·Light 02:30, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – On article quality – and as others have noted because the laws haven't taken effect. The article, at more than 10,000 words, is grossly overwritten, overblown and overweight – presumably by partisans who view the topic as a cause célèbre that calls for a crusade. – Sca (talk) 13:20, 20 November 2021 (UTC) (Closed) November 2021 lunar eclipse[edit] Consensus will not develop to post this.

The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 21:41, 19 November 2021 (UTC) You're forgetting that lunar eclipses often presage globally cataclysmic events, such as permanent cancellation of The Boat Race, which I fear may now be in the offing for 2022. – Sca (talk) 13:30, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Of course, lunar eclipses and the Boat Race are entirely unrelated. And of course, there will be no "permanent cancellation of The Boat Race", that's total bollocks, but perhaps inline with your regular contributions. As you perhaps should know already, The Boat Race 2022 is scheduled for next year, and if COVID stymies it, one imagines it will simply be moved to the River Great Ouse once again. I'm unclear as to where you think that a lunar eclipse would be a portent for the permanent cancellation of an event which has been conducted since 1829, even before the Third Reich failed to play nicely. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 17:56, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Ease up, Ramblo, it was a joke. (And BTW, the Third Reich and this topic are entirely unrelated.) – Sca (talk) 18:26, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Yeah, and this topic and the Boat Race are completely unrelated.

The assassination itself, of course, would have been ITN-worthy, as would the convictions of the accused. To me, this is on the same level.

Joseph2302 (talk) 20:40, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: Perhaps the blurb can mention the evacuation of thousands of residents and the destruction of infrastructure. Power outage and a small death toll won't cut it. --PFHLai (talk) 22:35, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Comment - this is quite a significant event in Canada, with reports that it could become the most expensive natural disaster in Canadian history [16], the death toll is expected to rise, along with wide ranging effects on supply chains and transportation networks. If I recall correctly, I think we did post the 2013 Alberta floods, for precedent. Connormah (talk) 22:39, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I guess "could be" is key here. If it does become the most expensive natural disaster after electing Trudeau in the history of Canada, then it's well placed for a blurb. Maybe now is premature. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:42, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Wait Living through this, it's a pretty devastating disaster, with all road access cut off to and from the Port of Vancouver, which is having a major impact on supply chains across Western Canada. But I don't think this meets the standard previously set for ITN just yet, although there are reports that the death toll is expected to rise. There's also reports of an imminent dike breach into a large city. As such, I'd suggest that we wait. NorthernFalcon (talk) 22:51, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – Lots of damage & dislocation but so far only one fatal. – Sca (talk) 23:29, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Wait If this gets worse and deadlier, then I will support.

Modest Genius talk 13:16, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Comment I would further comment that given Port of Vancouver is affected (the fourth largest port in North America by volume of goods) the supply chain issues are pretty notable. [17] CaffeinAddict (talk) 23:11, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, just “affected” the fourth in North America. Not America. Not even in the world. Let's not overestimate it.

Please read the guidelines. Admin instructions are here. ??Skip to suggestions In the news toolbox Error reports Nominations (Archives) Discussion General criteria Death criteria Recurring items Admin guide Image protection Current events portal v t e Shortcut WP:ITN/C This page provides a forum for editors to suggest items for inclusion on In the news (ITN), a protected template on the Main Page, as well as the forum for discussion of candidates. This is not the page to report errors in the ITN section on the Main Page—please go to the appropriate section at WP:ERRORS. Archives of past nominations can be found here. This candidates page is integrated with the daily pages of Portal:Current events. Under each daily section header below is the transcluded Portal:Current events items for that day (with a light green header). Each day's portal page is followed by a subsection for suggestions and discussion. A blurb is a one sentence summary of the news story. An alternate suggestion for the blurb is called an altblurb, and any more suggestions get labelled alt1, alt2, etc. A blurb needs at least one target article, highlighted in bold; reviewers check the quality of that article and whether it is updated, and whether reliable sources demonstrate the significance of the event. Other articles can also be linked. The Ongoing line is for regularly updated articles which cover events that remain in the news over a longer period of time. RD stands for the "recent deaths" line, and can include any living thing whose death was recently announced. In some cases, recent deaths may need additional explanation as provided by a blurb; this is decided by consensus.

Find the correct section below for the date of the event (not the date nominated). Do not add sections for new dates. These are automatically generated (at midnight UTC) by a bot; creating them manually breaks this process. Nominate the blurb for ITN inclusion under the "Suggestions" subheading for the date, emboldening the link in the blurb to the updated article. Use a level 4 header (====) when doing so. Preferably use the template {{ITN candidate}} to nominate the article related to the event in the news. Make sure that you include a reference from a verifiable, reliable secondary source. Press releases are not acceptable. The suggested blurb should be written in simple present tense. Adding an explanation why the event should be posted greatly increases the odds of posting. Please consider alerting editors to the nomination by adding the template {{ITN note}} to the corresponding article's talk page. Purge this page to update the cache There are criteria which guide the decision on whether or not to put a particular item on In the news, based largely on the extensiveness of the updated content and the perceived significance of the recent developments. These are listed at WP:ITN. Submissions that do not follow the guidelines at Wikipedia:In the news will not be placed onto the live template. Headers[edit] Items that have been posted or pulled from the main page are generally marked with (Posted) or (Pulled) in the item's subject so it is clear they are no longer active. Items can also be marked as (Ready) when the article is both updated and there seems to be a consensus to post. The posting admin, however, should always judge the update and the consensus to post themselves. If you find an entry that you don't feel is ready to post is marked (Ready), you should remove the mark in the header. Voicing an opinion on an item[edit] Format your comment to contain "support" or "oppose", and include a rationale for your choice. In particular, address the notability of the event, the quality of the article, and whether it has been updated. Please do not...[edit] add simple "support!" or "oppose!" votes without including your reasons. Similarly, curt replies such as "who?", "meh", or "duh!" are usually not helpful. Instead, explain the reasons why you think the item meets or does not meet the ITN inclusion criteria so a consensus can be reached. oppose an item because the event is only relating to a single country, or failing to relate to one. This applies to a high percentage of the content we post and is unproductive. accuse other editors of supporting, opposing or nominating due to a personal bias (such as ethnocentrism).

(Radio Sweden) (Reuters) Murder of Ahmaud Arbery verdict[edit] Article: Murder of Ahmaud Arbery (talk · history · tag) Blurb: ?All three men, George McMichael, Travis McMichael, and William Bryan Jr., are found guilty in the Murder of Ahmaud Arbery (Post) News source(s): CNN, The New York Times BBC Credits: Nominated by Andise1 (talk · give credit) Article updated Nominator's comments: Ending to a major court case related to racial issues in the US. Andise1 (talk) 20:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Is it really necessary to discuss such a case again? I refer to here. Yet another case with zero international impact and interest, yet another case of a purely local trial. Far from being akin to the conviction for the murder of George Floyd. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 20:46, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Alsoriano97 If "international impact" was required for postings, very little would be posted. 331dot (talk) 20:47, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, but it should be much more decisive when it comes to court rulings than in other cases (sports, science, elections...). If the follow-up of a trial has a very low international coverage/interest, will you tell me that it's not an important requirement to take into account when determining whether a court case is blurb-worthy or not? So many people are condemned every day in this world... _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 20:58, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Respectfully, we aren't talking about someone convicted of robbing the corner store, but a black man who was murdered basically for being in the wrong neighborhood in a part of the United States where convictions for this sort of thing are rare. And as I said, this incident has influenced changes in laws. 331dot (talk) 21:55, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, laws of a single U.S. state (as far as I know). If it were at the federal level I might come to support it, but not at this one. And many are the events that trigger legislative changes. And without a doubt, the article is in excellent shape. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 22:35, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support. This was a highly followed trial in the US, and even before the verdict this incident resulted in changes in Georgia law(the elimination of citizens' arrests). 331dot (talk) 20:52, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Article is also of decent quality from what I can see. 331dot (talk) 20:57, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support -- this verdict is likely to influence future trials of this type in the United States, and it is an historic decision in an area of the country known for its virulent racism. I doubt a jury would have reached this verdict in that area even 20 years ago. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 21:47, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support High profile case with notable legal impact, quality article. SpencerT•C 21:55, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support. This is a newsworthy verdict, and the article is in good shape from a skim-through. -- Tavix (talk) 21:56, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose people found guilty of crime that they themselves were stupid enough to video. Seriously. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:18, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose It's gotten a lot of attention for emotional reasons, and on a human level the crime was shocking. But its long-term significance is likely to be minimal. People are murdered every day all over the world. Some get a lot of press attention. We almost never post them. -Ad Orientem (talk) 22:25, 24 November 2021 (UTC) It's already had long term significance, both legally and perhaps socially. This was not a garden variety murder. I don't understand this line of thinking more generally. If this event is not notable due to not having "long term significance", it should be proposed for deletion. 331dot (talk) 22:31, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Not at all, there does exist a middle ground between ITN and AFD. This is a prime example. It's the result of a clear-cut murder case which the perps videoed themselves. A no-brainer. What would have been newsworthy would have been this ending in a non-guilty verdict and the no-doubt ensuing riots. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:34, 24 November 2021 (UTC) They taped it because they were in their mind attempting to make a citizens arrest(which was banned after this incident) even though they had no evidence of a crime. And in Georgia and elsewhere this is, rightly or wrongly, not clear cut. Even 15 years ago these men might have got off. And there was doubt Derek Chauvin would be convicted for killing George Floyd even though that was on video. 331dot (talk) 22:45, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, it's nuanced and emotive but ultimately it's just another crime story. It's been whipped up with publicity and is precisely the reason that we need to apply some common sense to these kinds of nominations. It is of minimal long term significance. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:49, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support Article is in good shape, well referenced, and story is currently being adequately covered by reliable sources. Meets all requirements. --Jayron32 22:38, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Similar to the Rittenhouse verdict - limited notability, outcome that isn't nationally or globally significant in any game-changing or important way. Prism55 (talk) 23:21, 24 November 2021 (UTC) English channel disaster[edit] Article: November 2021 English Channel disaster (talk · history · tag) Blurb: ?31 people die whilst crossing the English channel (Post) Alternative blurb: ?31 people die whilst crossing the English channel, in the channel's worst disaster in modern times News source(s): https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/world/calais-migrant-drowning-is-worst-ever-in-english-channel-official-says/ar-AAR5RlY https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/11/24/20-migrants-die-boat-capsizes-channel-near-calais/ Credits: Nominated by Llewee (talk · give credit) Nominator's comments: Article needs work but clearly a serious incident which should be posted once the page is ready Llewee (talk) 18:54, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Wait ... pending development of article, now a 150-word stub, more than half reactions. Whilst? – Sca (talk) 19:58, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose for now. Article is not developed enough to be ready for the main page. If that is fixed, it can be posted. Also, none of the blurbs link the article. That will need to be fixed. --Jayron32 20:04, 24 November 2021 (UTC) fixed now Llewee (talk) 21:01, 24 November 2021 (UTC) (Removed) Ongoing removal: 2021 Belarus–European Union border crisis[edit] Article: 2021 Belarus–European Union border crisis (talk · history · tag) Ongoing item removal (Post) Nominator's comments: The article has not has any significant updates for a week, and thus fails the ongoing criteria: In order to be posted to ongoing, the article needs to be regularly updated with new, pertinent information. If there have been significant updates in the last week, these should be added, but right now, this article fails the ongoing criteria. In particular, the last significant update is older than the day of the oldest ITN event (21 November), which is a general rule for something not being updated enough for Ongoing. Joseph2302 (talk) 12:26, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Remove. I think Belarus cleared out migrants from the border; Putin must think he made his point. 331dot (talk) 12:28, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Remove. The migrants have been moved away from the border and the situation has calmed down. No longer an ongoing event. Modest Genius talk 13:05, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – Although the situation appears to have been at least partially defused, there have been reports in recent days that in some cases Belorussian guards have continued to help migrants breach the border into Polish territory. [1], [2] [3] – Sca (talk) 13:27, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Remove the existence of news coverage that Sca notes is a necessary but not sufficient condition for maintaining an ongoing link. The article also needs to have been continuously updated. That clearly didn't happen here. --Jayron32 20:06, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – I have read the reports mentioned by Sca. It appears as if the situation have slowed down, but not ended. So still Ongoing.BabbaQ (talk) 20:23, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Removed. SpencerT•C 21:57, 24 November 2021 (UTC) (Posted) Magdalena Andersson[edit] Article: Magdalena Andersson (talk · history · tag) Blurb: ?Magdalena Andersson (pictured) is elected by the Riksdag as the first female Prime Minister of Sweden. (Post) Alternative blurb: ?Following the resignation of Stefan Löfven, Magdalena Andersson (pictured) is elected by the Riksdag as the first female Prime Minister of Sweden. Alternative blurb II: ?Magdalena Andersson (pictured) is elected as the first female Prime Minister of Sweden. News source(s): BBC Credits: Nominated by BastianMAT (talk · give credit) Article updated The nominated event is listed on WP:ITN/R, so each occurrence is presumed to be important enough to post. Comments should focus on whether the quality of the article and update meet WP:ITNCRIT, not the significance. Nominator's comments: ITNR, as it falls under "Changes in the holder of the office which administer the executive of their respective state/government, in those countries which qualify under the criteria above, as listed at List of current heads of state and government except when that change was already posted as part of a general election". First female prime minister of Sweden. BastianMAT (talk) 09:59, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment she takes office on the 26th (according to her article). Until that point, the blurb isn't correct, as she only becomes the first female PM of Sweden on that date. Is it usual to post when it's announced, or when they take office? Joseph2302 (talk) 10:04, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Usually when they are elected but yeah with the blurb of being elected. BastianMAT (talk) 10:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support - First female PM in Sweden. But change blurb to ”is elected” instead becomes.BabbaQ (talk) 10:06, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Yes. BastianMAT (talk) 10:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support Significant as new PM and first female. Perhaps the blub should be "elected by the Riksdag" since she didn't gain office through a normal election (by the people). cart-Talk 10:15, 24 November 2021 (UTC) That's normal in a parliamentary system. – Sca (talk) 15:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment The blurb should probably start with "Following the resignation of Stefan Löfven, ..." to provide context, since this was not an election outcome but a government reshuffle. --Tone 10:20, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support now the blurb has been changed to "is elected" seems fine to run now. Agree with Tone that we should make it clearer that this wasn't an election that caused this. Joseph2302 (talk) 11:01, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support Her article looks great, is ITNR and altblurb, although somewhat long, it's the most complete and clear of all. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 11:31, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Posting. --Tone 11:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Would suggest that we use the image of Andersson at the front page.BabbaQ (talk) 11:49, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Agree with this, we usually use the image for the newest blurb. Joseph2302 (talk) 14:32, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Post-posting support This is historic. -TenorTwelve (talk) 14:30, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Since Sweden's in the EU, perhaps she'll become the next Merkel. – Sca (talk) 15:25, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Then again, maybe not. – Sca (talk) 20:01, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Update by the nominator Things are looking bad for her and her party now. The Center Party (liberal) voted for the opposition’s budget and it got through. The Center party did not agree with the goverment’s budget, stating it was way too left. That would mean Magdallena now has to rule with right wing economic politics, which she accepted. However their junior party the Green party did not accept it and have left the goverment meaning a new Riksdag election for the prime minister post shall be held. Interesting development. SVT BastianMAT (talk) 16:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Update 2 by nominator Magdallena Andersson has officially resigned. We might have to pull the news back as she won’t be assuming office. She will only assume office if she wins a new prime minister vote, which might take place in a few days/weeks, depending on how the talks with the speaker goes. SVT BastianMAT (talk) 16:46, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Pull (or update the blurb). Her resignation is quickly making international news. 142.182.136.105 (talk) 17:38, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Update blurb Move over Kim Campbell, there's a new sheriff in town. Or more precisely, there was one for a few hours.Scaramouche33 (talk) 17:58, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Pull until it's confirmed whether she will now be the leader or not. Joseph2302 (talk) 18:01, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose pull What is ITNR is that a few hours ago she has been elected by the Swedish parliament. However much she has resigned. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 18:20, 24 November 2021 (UTC) What updating with "and immediately resigns" or something? This is a really weird sequence of events. --Tone 18:21, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Pull - The blurb, as it currently stands, is false.--WaltCip-(talk) 18:50, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Updated to Magdalena Andersson (pictured), shortly after being elected as the first female prime minister of Sweden, resigns. Any further changes, please? --PFHLai (talk) 19:13, 24 November 2021 (UTC) I think this is fine now. --Tone 19:25, 24 November 2021 (UTC) I'm not a big fan of blurbs that contemplate the resignation of a prime minister...But knowing a bit of precedent, it's very likely that in a few days/weeks she will be re-elected, as happened with Löfven in the middle of this year. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 19:48, 24 November 2021 (UTC) For the record, I support this new blurb. It will work until she is finally elected the new PM in a few days or at the longest a week.BabbaQ (talk) 20:21, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks. Hopefully, we'll have an update about her taking office soon. That would be a simple update to do. --PFHLai (talk) 20:31, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Pull -- wait until she actually is seated. She just resigned. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 21:22, 24 November 2021 (UTC) The blurb already says that. It's fine. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 21:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) It's probably just my own bias here; but it seems silly to post this when she just resigned. Forming coalition governments in a parliamentary system is weird. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 21:45, 24 November 2021 (UTC) It's a fascinating and encyclopedic story. Unlike the myriad legal cases being spewed out of the US these days.

But it's in the news now. Andrew?(talk) 08:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support important mission with global implications, good article. Polyamorph (talk) 08:18, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment. This may be notable as the first mission of its type (to post now); it will be ITNR when it arrives as well. Just saying. 331dot (talk) 08:19, 24 November 2021 (UTC) This may be ITN/R per "first ... launches of any type of rocket" as it's the first mission to use the NEXT drive but that's debatable. Andrew?(talk) 10:09, 24 November 2021 (UTC) The NEXT is the thruster on the spacecraft, not the rocket that put it up there(a Falcon 9). 331dot (talk) 12:31, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Such missions usually have multiple stages and each stage has separate rocket engines. The first stage is usually more spectacular but there's no scientific reason to prefer it. For deep space missions lasting years, the efficiency of the final spacecraft will be most important and this is a new design. Andrew?(talk) 12:54, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support important global mission (even if it does sound like DART is copying the plot of Salvation (TV series)). Added 3 cn tags to article, but apart from that, it looks more than good enough article quality for the front page. Joseph2302 (talk) 09:13, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support Everyone in the world should be happy we'll finally have a way to stop any doomsday asteroids from wiping us all out. Dream Focus 11:15, 24 November 2021 (UTC) If it works, of course... _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 11:39, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support is ITNR from what Andrew says and the global impact of this mission is undoubted, so it's clearly notable. In fact I think it should be one of the most important scientific news of the year. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 11:39, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Global impact?? I thought the idea was to avoid that! Martinevans123 (talk) 13:52, 24 November 2021 (UTC) This event can't be notable, its only impact is on a small unpopulated asteroid! WaltCip-(talk) 14:17, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Impactfulness nonapparent at this pt. in time & space. – Sca (talk) 15:00, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment the proposed blurb is a mess. I've added alt1, though for some reason that's messing up the template formatting - I can't work out why. Modest Genius talk 13:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Also, this is not ITNR, as it's not a new type of rocket and interplanetary probes are ITNR when they arrive at their destination, not when launched.

Modest Genius talk 13:44, 24 November 2021 (UTC) The fact that the mission is attempting to alter the course of the asteroid makes this particularly notable. Added alt2. Polyamorph (talk) 13:40, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Alt2 is incorrect. It won't 'deflect the course' of the asteroid. The impact will modify orbit of the moon around the asteroid, not either of their orbits around the Sun. Modest Genius talk 13:44, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Dimorphos is an asteroid (albeit a minor one compared to Didymos). It will deflect its course. Nothing to do with the Sun. Polyamorph (talk) 13:46, 24 November 2021 (UTC) It may deflect its course. – Sca (talk) 15:06, 24 November 2021 (UTC) It will deflect it, even if by only a negligible amount. But this is covered by the wording of alt2 "on a mission to attempt to deflect the course". Polyamorph (talk) 15:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – From what I've seen, this is such a complicated, long-term project that any significant results may be years off. – Sca (talk) 13:30, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose - no mention of Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck or Michael Bay.

The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 10:35, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Over a million people die on the roads every year – that's over 3,000 every day. The coverage of this case says that "there were often accidents in the area". It's routine. Andrew?(talk) 14:17, 23 November 2021 (UTC) There may have been many accidents, even some fatalities.

Joseph2302 (talk) 08:35, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Not terrorism, according to "sources", so whilst tragic, it appears to be a worse-than-usual crime gone wrong. Black Kite (talk) 08:44, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support -- It seems that around five people died in the attack. The perpetrator has been reported by a few media outlets as Daniel Brooks, a black man who raps under the name "MathboiFly" and has tons of social media posts supporting BLM, and this was in the aftermath of a very notable event where Rittenhouse was cleared as killing two black men in self-defence. OldPeace7068 (talk) 09:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Complete extrapolation. Police have said they believe he was on the run having committed a separate crime, nothing to do with Rittenhouse at all. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 09:35, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Wikipedia is there to report the facts. Police and many members of the public initially considered the possibility of Islamic terrorism due to similar incidents in the past involving Muslims, the targeting of a western festival, and the recent rise in Islamic terrorist activity, but police have now confirmed that this is not terrorism related. Similarly, there have been widespread links/controversy made between the rapper and his connections to BLM, and it has been linked to Rittenhouse whether you like it or not. It is part of the story. The killer is a major supporter and activist of BLM. And this happened in the aftermath of Rittenhouse's acquittal. It's all part of the background and developing story. OldPeace7068 (talk) 09:45, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Not at all. The police have stated he was fleeing a separate scene. Conflating this with BLM/Rittenhouse is pure crystal balling. Thanks. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 09:47, 22 November 2021 (UTC) "two black men" and you'd think we were on a website about facts... CharredWaffle (talk) 14:04, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. Calling this an "attack" may be a misnomer as it appears that the suspect was fleeing the police, not that it was a preplanned attack or terrorism. 331dot (talk) 12:50, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Maybe so. OTOH, at least one report quotes a witness as saying the vehicle seemed to be "targeting people" as it veered from side to side. Also, reports say it crashed through barriers to reach the parade, which seems to indicate that it was indeed an attack, though possibly not a pre-planned one. – Sca (talk) 16:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment The blurb should (and currently does not) mention the country in which this event took place. Chrisclear (talk) 12:56, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose - It's not at all clear that this is an act of terrorism, and thus not something that would be imminently notable.--WaltCip-(talk) 13:09, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose both on merit and article quality. As of this comment, the incident does not appear to have been a deliberate attack. I would be open to reconsideration if contrary information comes to light.

This doesn't mean motiveless events can't ever be posted but I would expect the results to be more devasting (like the various major building fires or collapses that we had). --Masem (t) 16:36, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Exactly, I think the same Masem. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 17:30, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Wait – As an AP update seems to suggest this was the act of a lone nutcase with a record, I've withdrawn my provisonal support. However, it seems we're still in a wait situation, since nine of the injured are listed in critical condition. If the toll were to rise to double digits, we might still want to consider a blurb about this very nasty event. – Sca (talk) 18:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support if the motivation turns out to be terrorism, neutral if otherwise. Mlb96 (talk) 19:04, 22 November 2021 (UTC) A post – by an IT user with no other contributions – on our article's talk page posits racial motivation. Seems highly dubious at this point, though. – Sca (talk) 19:08, 22 November 2021 (UTC) See WP:RS. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 19:11, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Please see expanded comment above. Thanks. – Sca (talk) 19:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support. This event is in the news and the article looks to be in good shape. -- Tavix (talk) 19:38, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: – Since perp's been ID'd & police say he'll face five counts of first-degree intentional homicide, this is looking potentially more significant. – Sca (talk) 20:02, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Per The Independent this guy had a domestic dispute, and drove his car like a lunatic. Not terror-related, just an idiot behind the wheel. Not significant, tragic, but will never make the top 1000 things that happened on Planet Earth in 2021, let alone the top 250. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support - a mass-casualty event, receiving international coverage (e.g., BBC), a suspect is being charged, and the article has been improved to sufficient quality. Levivich 20:04, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support - rare (even in the US) mass-casualty event. Article quality is decent. Destroyeraa (Alternate account) 20:28, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment a road traffic accident in the US is not rare. Mass-casualty events in the US are far from rare. It's pretty obvious that giving this tragic yet non-terrorist/non-BLM/non-protest/non-deliberate accident undue prominence is not what the encyclopedia was designed to do. Of course, you can dig into the BBC website and find coverage, it's all "shock and think of the children" in the US, but the rest of the world has moved on the moment it was clear it was a sad instance of a crime somewhere else having shitty side-effects, and literally nothing more. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) The last time I remember a similar incident happened in the US was late 2017 when somebody plowed into a crowd in Virginia after a violent demonstration got broken up. We posted the event that it was tangentially related to, largely on the strength of somebody plowing their car into a crowd and killing someone. You supported posting it. Rockphed (talk) 01:03, 23 November 2021 (UTC) If you're referring to Charlottesville car attack, that was about a man deliberately setting out to ram people. This is about a man trying to escape the scene of a domestic incident and getting into a road traffic accident. The two are incomparable. But good try. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 08:07, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Agreeing with previous posters, posting this event would seem to be giving undue weight to a tragic traffic accident. Comparison with the Charlottesville incident from several years back is unfair, given the explicitly political motivations of the earlier event. Wizardoftheyear (talk) 01:17, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Neutral and Wait Yes, with the additional details that have come to light, this is literally a domestic issue that had decidedly more tragic consequences. However, that is additional details. The initial response, and the fact there were several fatalities during a celebration, caught on camera and shared around the world before anyone knew what was going on, has made this major news and a source of intrigue. I think we need to wait to see if the news stations drop their coverage now that there is less intrigue and crisis; if it has effectively left the news cycle by end of day, take this as an oppose, but if it is still on the news banners, take this as support. Kingsif (talk) 01:42, 23 November 2021 (UTC) 4 of the 12 paragraphs in this article start "On November 2X". Typical anti-American bias from the Brits (which is far from rare) notwithstanding, the quality is not there yet. GreatCaesarsGhost 02:23, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Support - Tragic, criminally-induced mass-casualty. Significant details are now known. CoatCheck (talk) 03:03, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Wait It's very clear that there won't be consensus as is, but there may be more of one as things develop. Wait for now. DarkSide830 (talk) 03:46, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Strong Support. This is the deadliest vehicle ramming incident in the United States or Canada since 2018 and the deadliest in the US since 2017. 142.182.136.105 (talk) 07:37, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Comment I see there's been a tragic bus crash in Bulgaria which has killed at least 45 people. It would be safe to presume that supporters of this accident would support the posting of the Bulgarian crash, right? The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 08:09, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Nominate an article on it so that I can assess the quality. Without knowing what we are posting on the main page, it is impossible for me to know if the article is appropriate. --Jayron32 12:56, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Four hours ago....

Leaning toward support, for all the diff that would make here. – Sca (talk) 13:49, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Support for multiple fatalities, high number of serious injuries, and widespread news coverage. Jehochman Talk 13:50, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose A tragic event, but it is not a mass-casualty event. ArsenalGhanaPartey (talk) 14:11, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Comment - We have support and oppose !votes that directly contradict each other in terms of the notability of this event. Some say this is very notable. Others say this is not at all notable. How is an admin supposed to derive consensus from this? --WaltCip-(talk) 15:05, 23 November 2021 (UTC) By executive fiat. – Sca (talk) 15:44, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Well most of the support votes are from Americans (of those who have userpages), and almost all of the opposes are from non-Americans. So I guess it'll be a coin toss on whether an American or non-American admin decides... Joseph2302 (talk) 15:49, 23 November 2021 (UTC) How about one from a neutral country, say Liechtenstein? – Sca (talk) 16:19, 23 November 2021 (UTC) I voted to oppose as an American ArsenalGhanaPartey (talk) 16:02, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Oh, you must be from Manchester, N.H., then. – Sca (talk) 16:24, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. This at first got attention because it might have been terrorism related, no problem there. But all we are left with now is an accident which leaves 5 death: while tragic, this is sadly an everyday occurrence. We have e.g. this week a ferry accident in Sri Lanka (at least 6 death)[5], 7 death in Greece when migrants flee the police[6], 22 deaths on Lake Kivu[7], nine deaths in a fire in Bulgaria[8], 10 deaths in China after a car crash[9], ... I see no reason to post this, as it is not exceptional, has no lasting importance, and isn't even very interesting (without the terrorism angle). It's a sad tragedy, but a very common one. Fram (talk) 17:03, 23 November 2021 (UTC) I think it is WP:TOOSOON to make a determination as to whether this was an act of terror or not. Terrorism or not, the ramming appears to be deliberate, and it has made national and international headlines. Aasim (talk) 06:53, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. Per Fram, tragic, but not significant enough at a global scale: we don't even have articles about many similar tragedies elsewhere. Vanamonde (Talk) 17:45, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose.

Major election in an EU member state. – Illegitimate Barrister (talk • contribs), 02:46, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Question Do we post presidential elections even if the president has mostly symbolic roles? Scaramouche33 (talk) 07:32, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, heads of state elections are posted even if they are ceremonial/wield little power, it mostly depends on the article quality itself which should be more than sufficient. Two examples are the Italian presidental election and Czech presidental election, both having similar powers to the Bulgarian one. [10] [11] BastianMAT (talk) 09:02, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Weak support this article has been on front page for a week already, but I guess the second round presidency vote means that it's ITN eligible again. Article looks to have been sufficiently updated about the presidential second round vote. Joseph2302 (talk) 12:10, 22 November 2021 (UTC) This is not ITNR. We no longer post all elections for head of state- we post the election/choosing of the official with actual executive power, according to List of current heads of state and government; in Bulgaria that is the PM, not the president. 331dot (talk) 12:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) In which case, I oppose this nomination, and it shouldn't have been tagged as ITNR. Joseph2302 (talk) 12:37, 22 November 2021 (UTC) In fairness, it is a recent change that not everyone may be aware of. 331dot (talk) 12:41, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Alright, I thought going by older posts that head of state elections are still part of ITNR but if its been removed, no problem and thanks for the headsup for future nominations. BastianMAT (talk) 12:46, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I just saw this now. I must have missed the change or forgot about it. So my comment on other presidents is not relevant here. --Tone 17:49, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Exactly, that’s what got me confused to when I ITNR nominated this. In the past as you and I mentioned, similar head of state elections (with similar powers) such as Moldova(November 2020), Germany, Austria, Italy, Czech Republic have been posted. 331dot said the removal of ceremonial head of state elections from ITNR were ’recently’ done, so the change must have not been too long ago for us to not know that.BastianMAT (talk) 18:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Blurb on MainPage was updated and moved up --PFHLai (talk) 13:11, 22 November 2021 (UTC) PFHLai there wasn't consensus to do this update- the presidential election is not ITNR, and there was not consensus here that it's important enough for ITN. We should leave it where it is, so it can roll off soon, instead of moving it up so it'll stay on ITN for another week... Joseph2302 (talk) 13:27, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Post posting support If the election was stand-alone, we would probably post it. This is just the case where the general election were held together with the first round of presidential, so there is a single article. I don't see a problem. --Tone 14:56, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I doubt we would post this as a standalone item. He may be head of state, but he has no power. It's the Prime Minister of Bulgaria who would be posted automatically.  — Amakuru (talk) 17:18, 22 November 2021 (UTC) In fact he has been in de facto power since the 2021 April elections as he appointed his friend as acting prime minister. The de jure power he wields is similar to those in Italy and Czech Republic, where he gets to nominate the prime minister and supreme court judges, he can veto laws (although parliament can override) and he of course serves as head of state, don’t forget Bulgaria even has a vice president. In the past we have posted the Italian presidental and Czech Republic presidental elections, both are parliamantary republics too. I thought it was ITNR, but 331dot mentioned that head of state elections (where the head of state is not head of goverment) was recently removed from ITNR. Italian presidental election posted Czech Republic presidental election posted BastianMAT (talk) 17:32, 22 November 2021 (UTC) (ec) As far as I remember we post both if the articles are ok. We've posted presidents of Austria and Germany, which have a similar role, for example. Furthermore, the president of Germany is elected by Bundestag, not by a popular vote. --Tone 17:36, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Pull update and Revert back to previous version per Joseph2302. This guy is just a figure head, and we already posted the main election result. There was no reason to have bumped this up, and the result is not ITN/R so needs consensus, which it doesn't have.  — Amakuru (talk) 17:14, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Pull update and agree with above, not seeing consensus here for this to have even been posted in the first instance. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 17:21, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Beyond the issue of whether it should be on the main page, the blurb is clumsy. "In Bulgaria," is redundant. Where else but in Bulgaria would you be elected President of Bulgaria? Schwede66 17:57, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Restored old blurb. --PFHLai (talk) 18:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose pull Not a head of state change but in the same spirit This post was made by orbitalbuzzsaw gang (talk) 19:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment I think we need some kind of page break to restart voting. A lot of the opposition above was to the unilateral action and not the nom itself. as for me, Oppose while there are some states with significant power invested in the secondary office, this is not one of them. GreatCaesarsGhost 21:55, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I didn't particularly mind about the unilateral action myself - it was made in good faith - and my oppose is purely on the merits of the case, for much the same reasons as you.

Article: Peng Shuai (talk · history · tag) Blurb: ?Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai disappears after accusing a former Chinese Vice Premier of sexual assault. (Post) Alternative blurb: ?Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai is reported missing after accusing former Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli of sexual assault. News source(s): Guardian Credits: Nominated by Blythwood (talk · give credit) Article updatedNominator's comments: Seems to be a forced disappearance. This is a bit unusual, but has been a major news story. Disappearance section seems solid but the rest of the article on her career is less well sourced. The person has disappeared without a trace, so while it cannot be verified that this person person has died or been imprisoned, her disappearance is in itself the notable event. I wonder if this could be treated as something like the equivalent of a recent death. Blythwood (talk) 22:39, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support - Article is in good condition and the news is prominent, exceptional, and of great public interest around the world. Jehochman Talk 22:45, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose - Article appear in news, but headlines on CBC, CNN, BBC are still focused on Rittenhouse Trial for now, although this may change. Otherwise, the blurb should describe whats happening now (the reactions), that she has not been publicly heard is not ITN as that is a few days old. 99.247.176.90 (talk) 23:06, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose - I fail to see how this is any more worthy of ITN than the Rittenhouse trial, which was also not worthy of ITN. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 23:10, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Please don't oppose because you think another nomination should be posted and you don't think this one is as worthy. Judge nomination on its own merit. The two are about completely different things. -- KTC (talk) 23:12, 19 November 2021 (UTC) I don't think either are worthy of being posted. --RockstoneSend me a message! 01:20, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support per Jehochman. However I'm not quite sure about the term "disappears" here, even if I personally think the Chinese state did exactly that. -- KTC (talk) 23:16, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support per Jehochman. -- Tavix (talk) 23:20, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support this is far more notable than "another white American kills black Americans" and regardless of the fact that headlines are currently obsessing over the US proclivity to allow kids to routinely assassinate people without any kind of criminal conviction, Peng's disappearance is genuinely newsworthy and encyclopedic. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 23:23, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Not that it matters to this nomination, but Rittenhouse's victims were white. GreatCaesarsGhost 00:04, 20 November 2021 (UTC) *cough cough* Rittenhouse's victims were white *cough cough* – John M Wolfson (talk • contribs) 00:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Who said he wasn't talking about Young Dolph's routine assassin? We don't know he wasn't white. We don't know if he had other black American victims. Memphis is all about unsolved mysteries! AGF. InedibleHulk (talk) 02:06, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose on quality The article needs a lot of work, as there are multiple sections with no inline citations.Pawnkingthree (talk) 23:42, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support While this might be unduly implicative of the Chinese state being connected, if RSs are making that connection this definitely belongs. – John M Wolfson (talk • contribs) 00:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose on quality I would support this if the article has some ref work done. There's sections that are unsourced. --TDKR Chicago 101 (talk) 00:34, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose this is newsworthy for sure but blurbing that someone "disappeared" after making an accusation seems like a WP:BLPCRIME issue to me. --LaserLegs (talk) 00:39, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Completely agree it's an awkward thing to summarise in a way that fits BLP while keeping it clear why the event is notable, I'd welcome suggestions for alternative phrasing. I realise this is a fairly limited action, but for that reason I deliberately didn't link to the person she accused in the proposed blurb. Blythwood (talk) 01:57, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose as per LaserLegs, there's something wrong about posting speculation that someone disappeared straight after they made accusations. With little reliable information, this seems like a BLP issue to post it. Joseph2302 (talk) 01:47, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Far too speculative, with overtones of anti-China sentiment, and with too many unknowns. Needs far more clarification before it is posted. And a guarantee that ITN will publish a full We Were Wrong! statement and retraction on the Main page when it is found out she has just eloped with her boyfriend or girlfriend, as the case may be. HiLo48 (talk) 01:55, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Clearly if China "disappeared" her, that would be a story, but this appears to be Western nations making a demand of China and there's no hard evidence she has been killed or imprisoned or the like. We don't post this type of speculative stories. --Masem (t) 02:16, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support Per wide coverage in RSes. Normchou?? 03:22, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose unless the incident has a separate article. Sun8908?Talk 07:38, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support — article looks decent enough for ITN standards by my eye, wide coverage in RSes. If the choice of "disappears" is undesirable, then "is reported missing" might be a potential alternative (posted as altblurb). [osunpokeh/talk/contributions] 08:41, 20 November 2021 (UTC) I think that suggests she was reported missing in the police report sense, not that Novak Djokovic described her as "a missing person" to reporters. Not a bad idea. Just a bit ambiguous. InedibleHulk (talk) 09:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Strong support, in the news, top page news in many countries. The issue is she has suddenly disappeared after accusing a senior cabinet minister of a serious crime, and the involved parties are public figures indept of this incident, so there is nothing wrong as long as it is sourced and not stated as truth. Peng's disappearance and the resulting sports diplomacy pressure and boycott threats are sufficient Bumbubookworm (talk) 12:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Have you ever studied the difference between correlation and causation? HiLo48 (talk) 21:48, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Yes I have and I wonder if it's possible to have a maths competition over Wikipedia lol. I never said there was a causation, although I am sure many on Wikipedia have noted your hard-left POV eg trying to get all right of centre Australian newspapers struck off at RSN. Bumbubookworm (talk) 22:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Applause.

Something that may have happened isn't blurbworthy, no matter how widely it's hyped. – Sca (talk) 13:05, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose per Masem, Sca.

Polyamorph (talk) 20:03, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support per above. The article has unref'd sections about her tennis career, but the linked section is ready. Davey2116 (talk) 21:52, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. We shouldn't (and don't) post articles with multiple unsourced sections. The fact that the section linked in bold is referenced is irrelevant. Black Kite (talk) 23:26, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Wait Let's wait until we are 100% sure what has happened to her. Heythereimaguy (talk) 23:53, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Global Times continues to point to her, this time at a restaurant with a coach and friends, seemingly quite visible. Western speculation now turns to whether she's safe, though, or free from external interference or to be believed. All very personal and hard-to-answer questions, for anybody anywhere. InedibleHulk (talk) 00:10, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose it's just one person in a world where much worse things happen in other places like Ethiopia. Banedon (talk) 01:11, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose for now. Videos of Peng Shuai have supposedly surfaced. Nice4What (talk · contribs) – (Thanks ?) 03:30, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Support However, I propose removing the term 'Chinese' in front of Peng Shuai. It does not add to her character or her identity as a professional tennis player. Something along the lines of "Professional tennis player Peng Shuai disappears after accusing former Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli of sexual assault." would be better imo. However, we should also note the videos posted by Global Times editors (primarily those tweeted by editor-in-chief Hu Xijin) and their aftermath. JMonkey2006 (talk) 11:10, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – She's reappeared, online at least. End of story? – Sca (talk) 13:34, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Strong support Wide coverage by RSes and notable. Fakescientist8000 (talk) 14:05, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Still too murky and speculative, with little general impact. – Sca (talk) 15:24, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Leaving aside anything else, there is video evidence of her out and about so she hasn't been "disappeared" and isn't "missing". Whether or not something else is happening is in the realm of speculation, and would require a separate blurb. Also, very large swathes of the article on her career lack even a single citation. Is it not time to close this as no consensus already? Preceding posted by User:BSMRD – Sca (talk) 17:35, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: – Discussion tops 1,500 words. Posts running 4:3 against. – Sca (talk) 17:42, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Comment as nominator I'm willing to close soon now there's video of her alive (barring any big development, like it rapidly emerging this is an impersonator). Someone being in big trouble with their government isn't ITN-worthy, although I still think someone being forced-disappeared could be.

This applies to a high percentage of the content we post and is unproductive." "International notability" is not a criteria for posting at ITN, nor has it ever been. --Jayron32 19:05, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Well my direct opinion is that it is not notable. My reasoning is the discussion that already took place on the 2021 talk page. I also have previous discussions months ago where things highly notable to one country aren’t included. Elijahandskip (talk) 19:11, 19 November 2021 (UTC) This is not a discussion of the page 2021. The criteria established for other parts of Wikipedia don't apply here. If you wish to change the criteria used for the ITN box, then start a discussion at WT:ITN. Votes without valid rationales are given little weight. It's fine if you have a useful rationale, but merely "I don't think it's notable enough" does not provide any useful guidance to admins when deciding consensus. I mean, you're allowed to say any silly thing you want, I suppose, but you can't expect anyone to take you seriously if it isn't valid. --Jayron32 19:18, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Well since you don’t like my reasoning, just let me say “no”. People have supported ITN’s in the past without giving a reason, so my “Oppose” in this case will not have a reason. Elijahandskip (talk) 19:22, 19 November 2021 (UTC) As I said, it's a free world. People do nonsensical things all of the time. --Jayron32 19:24, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Yep, I couldn’t agree more. In reality, my oppose on this comes more to combat American Wikipedia vs English Wikipedia. There is a essay on Wikipedia that I recently read that has that meaning. Not everything that happens in America is notable for Wikipedia/2021/ITN/Portal Current Events, etc….Elijahandskip (talk) 19:34, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose (at least on news of just the verdict). It was a highly watched case in the U.S., but it was clear early on to many legal experts that are crying foul on judicial behavior. It is very very likely to see an appeal and so this is not the end. This is not like the result from the very public George Floyd protests (which we posted and had ongoing about those, and the verdict). That said, there had been concerns there may be rioting following an acquittal , and while I'm not seeing any immediate news on that, a major riot (akin to the LA riots after King's verdict) would likely be the newsworthy factor here. --Masem (t) 19:05, 19 November 2021 (UTC) There literally cannot be any appeal of a not guilty verdict. This is a core principle of how double jeopardy is handled in American jurisprudence. A not guilty jury verdict is basically always final. See [12]. There are some exceedingly rare exceptions to this, but none of them would apply in this case. An ordinary jury verdict of "not guilty" like this one (even in a controversial trial) is treated as basically sacrosanct, and there can be no appeals by the government. --Jayron32 19:08, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Except for the calls for a mistrial that are being entered now. I know there's complexities with double jeopardy there, but that's still on the books and that itself can be a legal process. --Masem (t) 19:15, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Um, what? There were calls for a mistrial by Rittenhouse's defense team prior to the jury verdict coming back. Now that the verdict is in their client's favor, I doubt highly they will press forward with these requests. Indeed, articles such as this one note "The verdict also meant that Judge Bruce Schroeder did not have to rule on the defense's motions for a mistrial." --Jayron32 19:23, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose as above. If we had to have an American court psychodrama today, the better option from a world-historical perspective would probably be the acquittal of the purported killers of Malcolm X. —Brigade Piron (talk) 19:20, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose AGF, but this is such a small story in the grand scheme. GreatCaesarsGhost 19:23, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Wait. It is too early to tell what impact this will have. It could be a Rodney King-like result where acquittal of the accused leads to broad social unrest, or it could pass with a shrug. I expect that we will know within 24 hours.

I wonder if we should put this blurb up now, or when Parliament repeals them and the farmers go home (don't have strong opinions either way, but I lean towards waiting). If we're going to put it up now, I've uploaded this screengrab of Modi's announcement from his CC-BY YouTube channel; we could use it. Btw Indefensible - Dracophyllum was the only updater, not DiplomatTesterMan. Kind regards, W. Tell DCCXLVI (talk to me!/c) 07:05, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Using the update to put back in ongoing instead of a final blurb would be fine too if preferable. And DiplomatTesterMan did more updates on the article before that, he still deserves some credit too I think. - Indefensible (talk) 07:12, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose because the article is not sufficiently updated. There is currently a 1 sentence mention in the lead of the repeal of the laws, and no mention of it, nor of any follow-on protests, anywhere in the body of the article. Before this can be posted, the latest developments would need to be added to the article appropriately. --Jayron32 12:18, 19 November 2021 (UTC) @Jayron32 Have you read the repeal section? Dracophyllum 20:10, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Your response is 8 hours after Jayron32's, Dracophyllum. The section may have not existed when Jayron commented. But then again, I am not going to take the time to check if it did exist at 12:18 PM UTC on 19 Nov 2021. Tube·of·Light 02:30, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: The announcement by itself has no legal value. Parliament has to repeal the laws, which it will probably do in the coming Winter Session. Also some farmer's unions are continuing protests until the laws are repealed and minimum support prices reconsidered. So it might be better to wait, but no strong opinion either way. --Jose Mathew (talk) 12:24, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Wait and see what the impact of this is.

India-centric Very India centric. It's probably not even the most important news in India right now, let alone the world.

In fact, we do post many India-centric stories here, this one having festered in ongoing for nearly a year. --LaserLegs (talk) 23:36, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support. Invariably it is announcements that get more attention than the actual act, most of the time(we post elections when the result is known, not when the results are official/certified). If Modi renegs, that will likely be newsworthy itself. 331dot (talk) 23:16, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Weak oppose - as Wilhelm Tell DCCXLVI says, the BKU is still protesting. I would prefer waiting till the laws are actually repealed (and FWIW, these laws are being repealed just before the 2022 Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly elections and elections in some other states, which are crucial for Modi's political party). Tube·of·Light 02:30, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – On article quality – and as others have noted because the laws haven't taken effect.

The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 21:41, 19 November 2021 (UTC) You're forgetting that lunar eclipses often presage globally cataclysmic events, such as permanent cancellation of The Boat Race, which I fear may now be in the offing for 2022. – Sca (talk) 13:30, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Of course, lunar eclipses and the Boat Race are entirely unrelated. And of course, there will be no "permanent cancellation of The Boat Race", that's total bollocks, but perhaps inline with your regular contributions. As you perhaps should know already, The Boat Race 2022 is scheduled for next year, and if COVID stymies it, one imagines it will simply be moved to the River Great Ouse once again. I'm unclear as to where you think that a lunar eclipse would be a portent for the permanent cancellation of an event which has been conducted since 1829, even before the Third Reich failed to play nicely. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 17:56, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Ease up, Ramblo, it was a joke. (And BTW, the Third Reich and this topic are entirely unrelated.) – Sca (talk) 18:26, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Yeah, and this topic and the Boat Race are completely unrelated. And it wasn't funny in any sense. So explain yourself. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 18:45, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support, this lunar eclipse has gotten significant news coverage. Both visibility paragraphs each have a single reference at the end. -- Tavix (talk) 16:01, 20 November 2021 (UTC) The discussion above is closed. Please do not modify it.

Power outage and a small death toll won't cut it. --PFHLai (talk) 22:35, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Comment - this is quite a significant event in Canada, with reports that it could become the most expensive natural disaster in Canadian history [16], the death toll is expected to rise, along with wide ranging effects on supply chains and transportation networks. If I recall correctly, I think we did post the 2013 Alberta floods, for precedent. Connormah (talk) 22:39, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I guess "could be" is key here. If it does become the most expensive natural disaster after electing Trudeau in the history of Canada, then it's well placed for a blurb. Maybe now is premature. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:42, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Wait Living through this, it's a pretty devastating disaster, with all road access cut off to and from the Port of Vancouver, which is having a major impact on supply chains across Western Canada. But I don't think this meets the standard previously set for ITN just yet, although there are reports that the death toll is expected to rise. There's also reports of an imminent dike breach into a large city. As such, I'd suggest that we wait.

[17] CaffeinAddict (talk) 23:11, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, just “affected” the fourth in North America. Not America. Not even in the world. Let's not overestimate it.

Admin instructions are here. ??Skip to suggestions In the news toolbox Error reports Nominations (Archives) Discussion General criteria Death criteria Recurring items Admin guide Image protection Current events portal v t e Shortcut WP:ITN/C This page provides a forum for editors to suggest items for inclusion on In the news (ITN), a protected template on the Main Page, as well as the forum for discussion of candidates. This is not the page to report errors in the ITN section on the Main Page—please go to the appropriate section at WP:ERRORS. Archives of past nominations can be found here. This candidates page is integrated with the daily pages of Portal:Current events. Under each daily section header below is the transcluded Portal:Current events items for that day (with a light green header). Each day's portal page is followed by a subsection for suggestions and discussion. A blurb is a one sentence summary of the news story. An alternate suggestion for the blurb is called an altblurb, and any more suggestions get labelled alt1, alt2, etc. A blurb needs at least one target article, highlighted in bold; reviewers check the quality of that article and whether it is updated, and whether reliable sources demonstrate the significance of the event. Other articles can also be linked. The Ongoing line is for regularly updated articles which cover events that remain in the news over a longer period of time. RD stands for the "recent deaths" line, and can include any living thing whose death was recently announced. In some cases, recent deaths may need additional explanation as provided by a blurb; this is decided by consensus.

Find the correct section below for the date of the event (not the date nominated). Do not add sections for new dates. These are automatically generated (at midnight UTC) by a bot; creating them manually breaks this process. Nominate the blurb for ITN inclusion under the "Suggestions" subheading for the date, emboldening the link in the blurb to the updated article. Use a level 4 header (====) when doing so. Preferably use the template {{ITN candidate}} to nominate the article related to the event in the news. Make sure that you include a reference from a verifiable, reliable secondary source. Press releases are not acceptable. The suggested blurb should be written in simple present tense. Adding an explanation why the event should be posted greatly increases the odds of posting. Please consider alerting editors to the nomination by adding the template {{ITN note}} to the corresponding article's talk page. Purge this page to update the cache There are criteria which guide the decision on whether or not to put a particular item on In the news, based largely on the extensiveness of the updated content and the perceived significance of the recent developments. These are listed at WP:ITN. Submissions that do not follow the guidelines at Wikipedia:In the news will not be placed onto the live template. Headers[edit] Items that have been posted or pulled from the main page are generally marked with (Posted) or (Pulled) in the item's subject so it is clear they are no longer active. Items can also be marked as (Ready) when the article is both updated and there seems to be a consensus to post. The posting admin, however, should always judge the update and the consensus to post themselves. If you find an entry that you don't feel is ready to post is marked (Ready), you should remove the mark in the header. Voicing an opinion on an item[edit] Format your comment to contain "support" or "oppose", and include a rationale for your choice. In particular, address the notability of the event, the quality of the article, and whether it has been updated. Please do not...[edit] add simple "support!" or "oppose!" votes without including your reasons. Similarly, curt replies such as "who?", "meh", or "duh!" are usually not helpful. Instead, explain the reasons why you think the item meets or does not meet the ITN inclusion criteria so a consensus can be reached. oppose an item because the event is only relating to a single country, or failing to relate to one. This applies to a high percentage of the content we post and is unproductive. accuse other editors of supporting, opposing or nominating due to a personal bias (such as ethnocentrism).

(Radio Sweden) (Reuters) Murder of Ahmaud Arbery verdict[edit] Article: Murder of Ahmaud Arbery (talk · history · tag) Blurb: ?All three men, George McMichael, Travis McMichael, and William Bryan Jr., are found guilty in the Murder of Ahmaud Arbery (Post) News source(s): CNN, The New York Times BBC Credits: Nominated by Andise1 (talk · give credit) Article updated Nominator's comments: Ending to a major court case related to racial issues in the US. Andise1 (talk) 20:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Is it really necessary to discuss such a case again? I refer to here. Yet another case with zero international impact and interest, yet another case of a purely local trial. Far from being akin to the conviction for the murder of George Floyd. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 20:46, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Alsoriano97 If "international impact" was required for postings, very little would be posted. 331dot (talk) 20:47, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, but it should be much more decisive when it comes to court rulings than in other cases (sports, science, elections...). If the follow-up of a trial has a very low international coverage/interest, will you tell me that it's not an important requirement to take into account when determining whether a court case is blurb-worthy or not? So many people are condemned every day in this world... _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 20:58, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Respectfully, we aren't talking about someone convicted of robbing the corner store, but a black man who was murdered basically for being in the wrong neighborhood in a part of the United States where convictions for this sort of thing are rare. And as I said, this incident has influenced changes in laws. 331dot (talk) 21:55, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, laws of a single U.S. state (as far as I know). If it were at the federal level I might come to support it, but not at this one. And many are the events that trigger legislative changes. And without a doubt, the article is in excellent shape. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 22:35, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support. This was a highly followed trial in the US, and even before the verdict this incident resulted in changes in Georgia law(the elimination of citizens' arrests). 331dot (talk) 20:52, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Article is also of decent quality from what I can see. 331dot (talk) 20:57, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support -- this verdict is likely to influence future trials of this type in the United States, and it is an historic decision in an area of the country known for its virulent racism. I doubt a jury would have reached this verdict in that area even 20 years ago. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 21:47, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support High profile case with notable legal impact, quality article. SpencerT•C 21:55, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support. This is a newsworthy verdict, and the article is in good shape from a skim-through. -- Tavix (talk) 21:56, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose people found guilty of crime that they themselves were stupid enough to video. Seriously. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:18, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose It's gotten a lot of attention for emotional reasons, and on a human level the crime was shocking. But its long-term significance is likely to be minimal. People are murdered every day all over the world. Some get a lot of press attention. We almost never post them. -Ad Orientem (talk) 22:25, 24 November 2021 (UTC) It's already had long term significance, both legally and perhaps socially. This was not a garden variety murder. I don't understand this line of thinking more generally. If this event is not notable due to not having "long term significance", it should be proposed for deletion. 331dot (talk) 22:31, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Not at all, there does exist a middle ground between ITN and AFD. This is a prime example. It's the result of a clear-cut murder case which the perps videoed themselves. A no-brainer. What would have been newsworthy would have been this ending in a non-guilty verdict and the no-doubt ensuing riots. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:34, 24 November 2021 (UTC) They taped it because they were in their mind attempting to make a citizens arrest(which was banned after this incident) even though they had no evidence of a crime. And in Georgia and elsewhere this is, rightly or wrongly, not clear cut. Even 15 years ago these men might have got off. And there was doubt Derek Chauvin would be convicted for killing George Floyd even though that was on video. 331dot (talk) 22:45, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, it's nuanced and emotive but ultimately it's just another crime story. It's been whipped up with publicity and is precisely the reason that we need to apply some common sense to these kinds of nominations. It is of minimal long term significance. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:49, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support Article is in good shape, well referenced, and story is currently being adequately covered by reliable sources. Meets all requirements. --Jayron32 22:38, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Similar to the Rittenhouse verdict - limited notability, outcome that isn't nationally or globally significant in any game-changing or important way.

Whilst? – Sca (talk) 19:58, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose for now. Article is not developed enough to be ready for the main page. If that is fixed, it can be posted. Also, none of the blurbs link the article. That will need to be fixed. --Jayron32 20:04, 24 November 2021 (UTC) fixed now Llewee (talk) 21:01, 24 November 2021 (UTC) (Removed) Ongoing removal: 2021 Belarus–European Union border crisis[edit] Article: 2021 Belarus–European Union border crisis (talk · history · tag) Ongoing item removal (Post) Nominator's comments: The article has not has any significant updates for a week, and thus fails the ongoing criteria: In order to be posted to ongoing, the article needs to be regularly updated with new, pertinent information. If there have been significant updates in the last week, these should be added, but right now, this article fails the ongoing criteria. In particular, the last significant update is older than the day of the oldest ITN event (21 November), which is a general rule for something not being updated enough for Ongoing. Joseph2302 (talk) 12:26, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Remove. I think Belarus cleared out migrants from the border; Putin must think he made his point. 331dot (talk) 12:28, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Remove. The migrants have been moved away from the border and the situation has calmed down. No longer an ongoing event. Modest Genius talk 13:05, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – Although the situation appears to have been at least partially defused, there have been reports in recent days that in some cases Belorussian guards have continued to help migrants breach the border into Polish territory. [1], [2] [3] – Sca (talk) 13:27, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Remove the existence of news coverage that Sca notes is a necessary but not sufficient condition for maintaining an ongoing link. The article also needs to have been continuously updated. That clearly didn't happen here. --Jayron32 20:06, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – I have read the reports mentioned by Sca. It appears as if the situation have slowed down, but not ended. So still Ongoing.BabbaQ (talk) 20:23, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Removed. SpencerT•C 21:57, 24 November 2021 (UTC) (Posted) Magdalena Andersson[edit] Article: Magdalena Andersson (talk · history · tag) Blurb: ?Magdalena Andersson (pictured) is elected by the Riksdag as the first female Prime Minister of Sweden. (Post) Alternative blurb: ?Following the resignation of Stefan Löfven, Magdalena Andersson (pictured) is elected by the Riksdag as the first female Prime Minister of Sweden. Alternative blurb II: ?Magdalena Andersson (pictured) is elected as the first female Prime Minister of Sweden. News source(s): BBC Credits: Nominated by BastianMAT (talk · give credit) Article updated The nominated event is listed on WP:ITN/R, so each occurrence is presumed to be important enough to post. Comments should focus on whether the quality of the article and update meet WP:ITNCRIT, not the significance. Nominator's comments: ITNR, as it falls under "Changes in the holder of the office which administer the executive of their respective state/government, in those countries which qualify under the criteria above, as listed at List of current heads of state and government except when that change was already posted as part of a general election". First female prime minister of Sweden. BastianMAT (talk) 09:59, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment she takes office on the 26th (according to her article). Until that point, the blurb isn't correct, as she only becomes the first female PM of Sweden on that date. Is it usual to post when it's announced, or when they take office? Joseph2302 (talk) 10:04, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Usually when they are elected but yeah with the blurb of being elected. BastianMAT (talk) 10:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support - First female PM in Sweden. But change blurb to ”is elected” instead becomes.BabbaQ (talk) 10:06, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Yes. BastianMAT (talk) 10:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support Significant as new PM and first female. Perhaps the blub should be "elected by the Riksdag" since she didn't gain office through a normal election (by the people). cart-Talk 10:15, 24 November 2021 (UTC) That's normal in a parliamentary system. – Sca (talk) 15:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment The blurb should probably start with "Following the resignation of Stefan Löfven, ..." to provide context, since this was not an election outcome but a government reshuffle. --Tone 10:20, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support now the blurb has been changed to "is elected" seems fine to run now. Agree with Tone that we should make it clearer that this wasn't an election that caused this. Joseph2302 (talk) 11:01, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support Her article looks great, is ITNR and altblurb, although somewhat long, it's the most complete and clear of all. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 11:31, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Posting. --Tone 11:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Would suggest that we use the image of Andersson at the front page.BabbaQ (talk) 11:49, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Agree with this, we usually use the image for the newest blurb. Joseph2302 (talk) 14:32, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Post-posting support This is historic. -TenorTwelve (talk) 14:30, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Since Sweden's in the EU, perhaps she'll become the next Merkel. – Sca (talk) 15:25, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Then again, maybe not. – Sca (talk) 20:01, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Update by the nominator Things are looking bad for her and her party now. The Center Party (liberal) voted for the opposition’s budget and it got through. The Center party did not agree with the goverment’s budget, stating it was way too left. That would mean Magdallena now has to rule with right wing economic politics, which she accepted. However their junior party the Green party did not accept it and have left the goverment meaning a new Riksdag election for the prime minister post shall be held. Interesting development. SVT BastianMAT (talk) 16:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Update 2 by nominator Magdallena Andersson has officially resigned. We might have to pull the news back as she won’t be assuming office. She will only assume office if she wins a new prime minister vote, which might take place in a few days/weeks, depending on how the talks with the speaker goes. SVT BastianMAT (talk) 16:46, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Pull (or update the blurb). Her resignation is quickly making international news. 142.182.136.105 (talk) 17:38, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Update blurb Move over Kim Campbell, there's a new sheriff in town. Or more precisely, there was one for a few hours.Scaramouche33 (talk) 17:58, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Pull until it's confirmed whether she will now be the leader or not. Joseph2302 (talk) 18:01, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose pull What is ITNR is that a few hours ago she has been elected by the Swedish parliament. However much she has resigned. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 18:20, 24 November 2021 (UTC) What updating with "and immediately resigns" or something? This is a really weird sequence of events. --Tone 18:21, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Pull - The blurb, as it currently stands, is false.--WaltCip-(talk) 18:50, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Updated to Magdalena Andersson (pictured), shortly after being elected as the first female prime minister of Sweden, resigns. Any further changes, please? --PFHLai (talk) 19:13, 24 November 2021 (UTC) I think this is fine now. --Tone 19:25, 24 November 2021 (UTC) I'm not a big fan of blurbs that contemplate the resignation of a prime minister...But knowing a bit of precedent, it's very likely that in a few days/weeks she will be re-elected, as happened with Löfven in the middle of this year. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 19:48, 24 November 2021 (UTC) For the record, I support this new blurb. It will work until she is finally elected the new PM in a few days or at the longest a week.BabbaQ (talk) 20:21, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks. Hopefully, we'll have an update about her taking office soon. That would be a simple update to do. --PFHLai (talk) 20:31, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Pull -- wait until she actually is seated. She just resigned. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 21:22, 24 November 2021 (UTC) The blurb already says that. It's fine. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 21:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) It's probably just my own bias here; but it seems silly to post this when she just resigned. Forming coalition governments in a parliamentary system is weird. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 21:45, 24 November 2021 (UTC) It's a fascinating and encyclopedic story. Unlike the myriad legal cases being spewed out of the US these days.

But it's in the news now. Andrew?(talk) 08:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support important mission with global implications, good article. Polyamorph (talk) 08:18, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment. This may be notable as the first mission of its type (to post now); it will be ITNR when it arrives as well. Just saying. 331dot (talk) 08:19, 24 November 2021 (UTC) This may be ITN/R per "first ... launches of any type of rocket" as it's the first mission to use the NEXT drive but that's debatable. Andrew?(talk) 10:09, 24 November 2021 (UTC) The NEXT is the thruster on the spacecraft, not the rocket that put it up there(a Falcon 9). 331dot (talk) 12:31, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Such missions usually have multiple stages and each stage has separate rocket engines. The first stage is usually more spectacular but there's no scientific reason to prefer it. For deep space missions lasting years, the efficiency of the final spacecraft will be most important and this is a new design. Andrew?(talk) 12:54, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support important global mission (even if it does sound like DART is copying the plot of Salvation (TV series)). Added 3 cn tags to article, but apart from that, it looks more than good enough article quality for the front page. Joseph2302 (talk) 09:13, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support Everyone in the world should be happy we'll finally have a way to stop any doomsday asteroids from wiping us all out. Dream Focus 11:15, 24 November 2021 (UTC) If it works, of course... _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 11:39, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support is ITNR from what Andrew says and the global impact of this mission is undoubted, so it's clearly notable. In fact I think it should be one of the most important scientific news of the year. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 11:39, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Global impact?? I thought the idea was to avoid that! Martinevans123 (talk) 13:52, 24 November 2021 (UTC) This event can't be notable, its only impact is on a small unpopulated asteroid! WaltCip-(talk) 14:17, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Impactfulness nonapparent at this pt. in time & space. – Sca (talk) 15:00, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment the proposed blurb is a mess. I've added alt1, though for some reason that's messing up the template formatting - I can't work out why. Modest Genius talk 13:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Also, this is not ITNR, as it's not a new type of rocket and interplanetary probes are ITNR when they arrive at their destination, not when launched.

Modest Genius talk 13:44, 24 November 2021 (UTC) The fact that the mission is attempting to alter the course of the asteroid makes this particularly notable. Added alt2. Polyamorph (talk) 13:40, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Alt2 is incorrect. It won't 'deflect the course' of the asteroid. The impact will modify orbit of the moon around the asteroid, not either of their orbits around the Sun. Modest Genius talk 13:44, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Dimorphos is an asteroid (albeit a minor one compared to Didymos). It will deflect its course. Nothing to do with the Sun. Polyamorph (talk) 13:46, 24 November 2021 (UTC) It may deflect its course. – Sca (talk) 15:06, 24 November 2021 (UTC) It will deflect it, even if by only a negligible amount. But this is covered by the wording of alt2 "on a mission to attempt to deflect the course". Polyamorph (talk) 15:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – From what I've seen, this is such a complicated, long-term project that any significant results may be years off. – Sca (talk) 13:30, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose - no mention of Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck or Michael Bay.

The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 10:35, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Over a million people die on the roads every year – that's over 3,000 every day. The coverage of this case says that "there were often accidents in the area". It's routine. Andrew?(talk) 14:17, 23 November 2021 (UTC) There may have been many accidents, even some fatalities.

Joseph2302 (talk) 08:35, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Not terrorism, according to "sources", so whilst tragic, it appears to be a worse-than-usual crime gone wrong. Black Kite (talk) 08:44, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support -- It seems that around five people died in the attack. The perpetrator has been reported by a few media outlets as Daniel Brooks, a black man who raps under the name "MathboiFly" and has tons of social media posts supporting BLM, and this was in the aftermath of a very notable event where Rittenhouse was cleared as killing two black men in self-defence. OldPeace7068 (talk) 09:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Complete extrapolation. Police have said they believe he was on the run having committed a separate crime, nothing to do with Rittenhouse at all. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 09:35, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Wikipedia is there to report the facts. Police and many members of the public initially considered the possibility of Islamic terrorism due to similar incidents in the past involving Muslims, the targeting of a western festival, and the recent rise in Islamic terrorist activity, but police have now confirmed that this is not terrorism related. Similarly, there have been widespread links/controversy made between the rapper and his connections to BLM, and it has been linked to Rittenhouse whether you like it or not. It is part of the story. The killer is a major supporter and activist of BLM. And this happened in the aftermath of Rittenhouse's acquittal. It's all part of the background and developing story. OldPeace7068 (talk) 09:45, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Not at all. The police have stated he was fleeing a separate scene. Conflating this with BLM/Rittenhouse is pure crystal balling. Thanks. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 09:47, 22 November 2021 (UTC) "two black men" and you'd think we were on a website about facts... CharredWaffle (talk) 14:04, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. Calling this an "attack" may be a misnomer as it appears that the suspect was fleeing the police, not that it was a preplanned attack or terrorism. 331dot (talk) 12:50, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Maybe so. OTOH, at least one report quotes a witness as saying the vehicle seemed to be "targeting people" as it veered from side to side. Also, reports say it crashed through barriers to reach the parade, which seems to indicate that it was indeed an attack, though possibly not a pre-planned one. – Sca (talk) 16:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment The blurb should (and currently does not) mention the country in which this event took place. Chrisclear (talk) 12:56, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose - It's not at all clear that this is an act of terrorism, and thus not something that would be imminently notable.--WaltCip-(talk) 13:09, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose both on merit and article quality. As of this comment, the incident does not appear to have been a deliberate attack. I would be open to reconsideration if contrary information comes to light.

This doesn't mean motiveless events can't ever be posted but I would expect the results to be more devasting (like the various major building fires or collapses that we had). --Masem (t) 16:36, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Exactly, I think the same Masem. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 17:30, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Wait – As an AP update seems to suggest this was the act of a lone nutcase with a record, I've withdrawn my provisonal support. However, it seems we're still in a wait situation, since nine of the injured are listed in critical condition. If the toll were to rise to double digits, we might still want to consider a blurb about this very nasty event. – Sca (talk) 18:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support if the motivation turns out to be terrorism, neutral if otherwise. Mlb96 (talk) 19:04, 22 November 2021 (UTC) A post – by an IT user with no other contributions – on our article's talk page posits racial motivation. Seems highly dubious at this point, though. – Sca (talk) 19:08, 22 November 2021 (UTC) See WP:RS. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 19:11, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Please see expanded comment above. Thanks. – Sca (talk) 19:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support. This event is in the news and the article looks to be in good shape. -- Tavix (talk) 19:38, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: – Since perp's been ID'd & police say he'll face five counts of first-degree intentional homicide, this is looking potentially more significant. – Sca (talk) 20:02, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Per The Independent this guy had a domestic dispute, and drove his car like a lunatic. Not terror-related, just an idiot behind the wheel. Not significant, tragic, but will never make the top 1000 things that happened on Planet Earth in 2021, let alone the top 250. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support - a mass-casualty event, receiving international coverage (e.g., BBC), a suspect is being charged, and the article has been improved to sufficient quality. Levivich 20:04, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support - rare (even in the US) mass-casualty event. Article quality is decent. Destroyeraa (Alternate account) 20:28, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment a road traffic accident in the US is not rare. Mass-casualty events in the US are far from rare. It's pretty obvious that giving this tragic yet non-terrorist/non-BLM/non-protest/non-deliberate accident undue prominence is not what the encyclopedia was designed to do. Of course, you can dig into the BBC website and find coverage, it's all "shock and think of the children" in the US, but the rest of the world has moved on the moment it was clear it was a sad instance of a crime somewhere else having shitty side-effects, and literally nothing more. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) The last time I remember a similar incident happened in the US was late 2017 when somebody plowed into a crowd in Virginia after a violent demonstration got broken up. We posted the event that it was tangentially related to, largely on the strength of somebody plowing their car into a crowd and killing someone. You supported posting it. Rockphed (talk) 01:03, 23 November 2021 (UTC) If you're referring to Charlottesville car attack, that was about a man deliberately setting out to ram people. This is about a man trying to escape the scene of a domestic incident and getting into a road traffic accident. The two are incomparable. But good try. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 08:07, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Agreeing with previous posters, posting this event would seem to be giving undue weight to a tragic traffic accident. Comparison with the Charlottesville incident from several years back is unfair, given the explicitly political motivations of the earlier event. Wizardoftheyear (talk) 01:17, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Neutral and Wait Yes, with the additional details that have come to light, this is literally a domestic issue that had decidedly more tragic consequences. However, that is additional details. The initial response, and the fact there were several fatalities during a celebration, caught on camera and shared around the world before anyone knew what was going on, has made this major news and a source of intrigue. I think we need to wait to see if the news stations drop their coverage now that there is less intrigue and crisis; if it has effectively left the news cycle by end of day, take this as an oppose, but if it is still on the news banners, take this as support. Kingsif (talk) 01:42, 23 November 2021 (UTC) 4 of the 12 paragraphs in this article start "On November 2X". Typical anti-American bias from the Brits (which is far from rare) notwithstanding, the quality is not there yet. GreatCaesarsGhost 02:23, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Support - Tragic, criminally-induced mass-casualty. Significant details are now known. CoatCheck (talk) 03:03, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Wait It's very clear that there won't be consensus as is, but there may be more of one as things develop. Wait for now. DarkSide830 (talk) 03:46, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Strong Support. This is the deadliest vehicle ramming incident in the United States or Canada since 2018 and the deadliest in the US since 2017. 142.182.136.105 (talk) 07:37, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Comment I see there's been a tragic bus crash in Bulgaria which has killed at least 45 people. It would be safe to presume that supporters of this accident would support the posting of the Bulgarian crash, right? The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 08:09, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Nominate an article on it so that I can assess the quality. Without knowing what we are posting on the main page, it is impossible for me to know if the article is appropriate. --Jayron32 12:56, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Four hours ago....

Leaning toward support, for all the diff that would make here. – Sca (talk) 13:49, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Support for multiple fatalities, high number of serious injuries, and widespread news coverage. Jehochman Talk 13:50, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose A tragic event, but it is not a mass-casualty event. ArsenalGhanaPartey (talk) 14:11, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Comment - We have support and oppose !votes that directly contradict each other in terms of the notability of this event. Some say this is very notable. Others say this is not at all notable. How is an admin supposed to derive consensus from this? --WaltCip-(talk) 15:05, 23 November 2021 (UTC) By executive fiat. – Sca (talk) 15:44, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Well most of the support votes are from Americans (of those who have userpages), and almost all of the opposes are from non-Americans. So I guess it'll be a coin toss on whether an American or non-American admin decides... Joseph2302 (talk) 15:49, 23 November 2021 (UTC) How about one from a neutral country, say Liechtenstein? – Sca (talk) 16:19, 23 November 2021 (UTC) I voted to oppose as an American ArsenalGhanaPartey (talk) 16:02, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Oh, you must be from Manchester, N.H., then. – Sca (talk) 16:24, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. This at first got attention because it might have been terrorism related, no problem there. But all we are left with now is an accident which leaves 5 death: while tragic, this is sadly an everyday occurrence. We have e.g. this week a ferry accident in Sri Lanka (at least 6 death)[5], 7 death in Greece when migrants flee the police[6], 22 deaths on Lake Kivu[7], nine deaths in a fire in Bulgaria[8], 10 deaths in China after a car crash[9], ... I see no reason to post this, as it is not exceptional, has no lasting importance, and isn't even very interesting (without the terrorism angle). It's a sad tragedy, but a very common one. Fram (talk) 17:03, 23 November 2021 (UTC) I think it is WP:TOOSOON to make a determination as to whether this was an act of terror or not. Terrorism or not, the ramming appears to be deliberate, and it has made national and international headlines. Aasim (talk) 06:53, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. Per Fram, tragic, but not significant enough at a global scale: we don't even have articles about many similar tragedies elsewhere. Vanamonde (Talk) 17:45, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose.

Major election in an EU member state. – Illegitimate Barrister (talk • contribs), 02:46, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Question Do we post presidential elections even if the president has mostly symbolic roles? Scaramouche33 (talk) 07:32, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, heads of state elections are posted even if they are ceremonial/wield little power, it mostly depends on the article quality itself which should be more than sufficient. Two examples are the Italian presidental election and Czech presidental election, both having similar powers to the Bulgarian one. [10] [11] BastianMAT (talk) 09:02, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Weak support this article has been on front page for a week already, but I guess the second round presidency vote means that it's ITN eligible again. Article looks to have been sufficiently updated about the presidential second round vote. Joseph2302 (talk) 12:10, 22 November 2021 (UTC) This is not ITNR. We no longer post all elections for head of state- we post the election/choosing of the official with actual executive power, according to List of current heads of state and government; in Bulgaria that is the PM, not the president. 331dot (talk) 12:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) In which case, I oppose this nomination, and it shouldn't have been tagged as ITNR. Joseph2302 (talk) 12:37, 22 November 2021 (UTC) In fairness, it is a recent change that not everyone may be aware of. 331dot (talk) 12:41, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Alright, I thought going by older posts that head of state elections are still part of ITNR but if its been removed, no problem and thanks for the headsup for future nominations. BastianMAT (talk) 12:46, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I just saw this now. I must have missed the change or forgot about it. So my comment on other presidents is not relevant here. --Tone 17:49, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Exactly, that’s what got me confused to when I ITNR nominated this. In the past as you and I mentioned, similar head of state elections (with similar powers) such as Moldova(November 2020), Germany, Austria, Italy, Czech Republic have been posted. 331dot said the removal of ceremonial head of state elections from ITNR were ’recently’ done, so the change must have not been too long ago for us to not know that.BastianMAT (talk) 18:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Blurb on MainPage was updated and moved up --PFHLai (talk) 13:11, 22 November 2021 (UTC) PFHLai there wasn't consensus to do this update- the presidential election is not ITNR, and there was not consensus here that it's important enough for ITN. We should leave it where it is, so it can roll off soon, instead of moving it up so it'll stay on ITN for another week... Joseph2302 (talk) 13:27, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Post posting support If the election was stand-alone, we would probably post it. This is just the case where the general election were held together with the first round of presidential, so there is a single article. I don't see a problem. --Tone 14:56, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I doubt we would post this as a standalone item. He may be head of state, but he has no power. It's the Prime Minister of Bulgaria who would be posted automatically.  — Amakuru (talk) 17:18, 22 November 2021 (UTC) In fact he has been in de facto power since the 2021 April elections as he appointed his friend as acting prime minister. The de jure power he wields is similar to those in Italy and Czech Republic, where he gets to nominate the prime minister and supreme court judges, he can veto laws (although parliament can override) and he of course serves as head of state, don’t forget Bulgaria even has a vice president. In the past we have posted the Italian presidental and Czech Republic presidental elections, both are parliamantary republics too. I thought it was ITNR, but 331dot mentioned that head of state elections (where the head of state is not head of goverment) was recently removed from ITNR. Italian presidental election posted Czech Republic presidental election posted BastianMAT (talk) 17:32, 22 November 2021 (UTC) (ec) As far as I remember we post both if the articles are ok. We've posted presidents of Austria and Germany, which have a similar role, for example. Furthermore, the president of Germany is elected by Bundestag, not by a popular vote. --Tone 17:36, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Pull update and Revert back to previous version per Joseph2302. This guy is just a figure head, and we already posted the main election result. There was no reason to have bumped this up, and the result is not ITN/R so needs consensus, which it doesn't have.  — Amakuru (talk) 17:14, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Pull update and agree with above, not seeing consensus here for this to have even been posted in the first instance. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 17:21, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Beyond the issue of whether it should be on the main page, the blurb is clumsy. "In Bulgaria," is redundant. Where else but in Bulgaria would you be elected President of Bulgaria? Schwede66 17:57, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Restored old blurb. --PFHLai (talk) 18:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose pull Not a head of state change but in the same spirit This post was made by orbitalbuzzsaw gang (talk) 19:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment I think we need some kind of page break to restart voting. A lot of the opposition above was to the unilateral action and not the nom itself. as for me, Oppose while there are some states with significant power invested in the secondary office, this is not one of them. GreatCaesarsGhost 21:55, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I didn't particularly mind about the unilateral action myself - it was made in good faith - and my oppose is purely on the merits of the case, for much the same reasons as you.

Article: Peng Shuai (talk · history · tag) Blurb: ?Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai disappears after accusing a former Chinese Vice Premier of sexual assault. (Post) Alternative blurb: ?Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai is reported missing after accusing former Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli of sexual assault. News source(s): Guardian Credits: Nominated by Blythwood (talk · give credit) Article updatedNominator's comments: Seems to be a forced disappearance. This is a bit unusual, but has been a major news story. Disappearance section seems solid but the rest of the article on her career is less well sourced. The person has disappeared without a trace, so while it cannot be verified that this person person has died or been imprisoned, her disappearance is in itself the notable event. I wonder if this could be treated as something like the equivalent of a recent death. Blythwood (talk) 22:39, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support - Article is in good condition and the news is prominent, exceptional, and of great public interest around the world. Jehochman Talk 22:45, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose - Article appear in news, but headlines on CBC, CNN, BBC are still focused on Rittenhouse Trial for now, although this may change. Otherwise, the blurb should describe whats happening now (the reactions), that she has not been publicly heard is not ITN as that is a few days old. 99.247.176.90 (talk) 23:06, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose - I fail to see how this is any more worthy of ITN than the Rittenhouse trial, which was also not worthy of ITN. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 23:10, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Please don't oppose because you think another nomination should be posted and you don't think this one is as worthy. Judge nomination on its own merit. The two are about completely different things. -- KTC (talk) 23:12, 19 November 2021 (UTC) I don't think either are worthy of being posted. --RockstoneSend me a message! 01:20, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support per Jehochman. However I'm not quite sure about the term "disappears" here, even if I personally think the Chinese state did exactly that. -- KTC (talk) 23:16, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support per Jehochman. -- Tavix (talk) 23:20, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support this is far more notable than "another white American kills black Americans" and regardless of the fact that headlines are currently obsessing over the US proclivity to allow kids to routinely assassinate people without any kind of criminal conviction, Peng's disappearance is genuinely newsworthy and encyclopedic. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 23:23, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Not that it matters to this nomination, but Rittenhouse's victims were white. GreatCaesarsGhost 00:04, 20 November 2021 (UTC) *cough cough* Rittenhouse's victims were white *cough cough* – John M Wolfson (talk • contribs) 00:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Who said he wasn't talking about Young Dolph's routine assassin? We don't know he wasn't white. We don't know if he had other black American victims. Memphis is all about unsolved mysteries! AGF. InedibleHulk (talk) 02:06, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose on quality The article needs a lot of work, as there are multiple sections with no inline citations.Pawnkingthree (talk) 23:42, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support While this might be unduly implicative of the Chinese state being connected, if RSs are making that connection this definitely belongs. – John M Wolfson (talk • contribs) 00:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose on quality I would support this if the article has some ref work done. There's sections that are unsourced. --TDKR Chicago 101 (talk) 00:34, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose this is newsworthy for sure but blurbing that someone "disappeared" after making an accusation seems like a WP:BLPCRIME issue to me. --LaserLegs (talk) 00:39, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Completely agree it's an awkward thing to summarise in a way that fits BLP while keeping it clear why the event is notable, I'd welcome suggestions for alternative phrasing. I realise this is a fairly limited action, but for that reason I deliberately didn't link to the person she accused in the proposed blurb. Blythwood (talk) 01:57, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose as per LaserLegs, there's something wrong about posting speculation that someone disappeared straight after they made accusations. With little reliable information, this seems like a BLP issue to post it. Joseph2302 (talk) 01:47, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Far too speculative, with overtones of anti-China sentiment, and with too many unknowns. Needs far more clarification before it is posted. And a guarantee that ITN will publish a full We Were Wrong! statement and retraction on the Main page when it is found out she has just eloped with her boyfriend or girlfriend, as the case may be. HiLo48 (talk) 01:55, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Clearly if China "disappeared" her, that would be a story, but this appears to be Western nations making a demand of China and there's no hard evidence she has been killed or imprisoned or the like. We don't post this type of speculative stories. --Masem (t) 02:16, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support Per wide coverage in RSes. Normchou?? 03:22, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose unless the incident has a separate article. Sun8908?Talk 07:38, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support — article looks decent enough for ITN standards by my eye, wide coverage in RSes. If the choice of "disappears" is undesirable, then "is reported missing" might be a potential alternative (posted as altblurb). [osunpokeh/talk/contributions] 08:41, 20 November 2021 (UTC) I think that suggests she was reported missing in the police report sense, not that Novak Djokovic described her as "a missing person" to reporters. Not a bad idea. Just a bit ambiguous. InedibleHulk (talk) 09:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Strong support, in the news, top page news in many countries. The issue is she has suddenly disappeared after accusing a senior cabinet minister of a serious crime, and the involved parties are public figures indept of this incident, so there is nothing wrong as long as it is sourced and not stated as truth. Peng's disappearance and the resulting sports diplomacy pressure and boycott threats are sufficient Bumbubookworm (talk) 12:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Have you ever studied the difference between correlation and causation? HiLo48 (talk) 21:48, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Yes I have and I wonder if it's possible to have a maths competition over Wikipedia lol. I never said there was a causation, although I am sure many on Wikipedia have noted your hard-left POV eg trying to get all right of centre Australian newspapers struck off at RSN. Bumbubookworm (talk) 22:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Applause.

Something that may have happened isn't blurbworthy, no matter how widely it's hyped. – Sca (talk) 13:05, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose per Masem, Sca.

Polyamorph (talk) 20:03, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support per above. The article has unref'd sections about her tennis career, but the linked section is ready. Davey2116 (talk) 21:52, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. We shouldn't (and don't) post articles with multiple unsourced sections. The fact that the section linked in bold is referenced is irrelevant. Black Kite (talk) 23:26, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Wait Let's wait until we are 100% sure what has happened to her. Heythereimaguy (talk) 23:53, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Global Times continues to point to her, this time at a restaurant with a coach and friends, seemingly quite visible. Western speculation now turns to whether she's safe, though, or free from external interference or to be believed. All very personal and hard-to-answer questions, for anybody anywhere. InedibleHulk (talk) 00:10, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose it's just one person in a world where much worse things happen in other places like Ethiopia. Banedon (talk) 01:11, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose for now. Videos of Peng Shuai have supposedly surfaced. Nice4What (talk · contribs) – (Thanks ?) 03:30, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Support However, I propose removing the term 'Chinese' in front of Peng Shuai. It does not add to her character or her identity as a professional tennis player. Something along the lines of "Professional tennis player Peng Shuai disappears after accusing former Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli of sexual assault." would be better imo. However, we should also note the videos posted by Global Times editors (primarily those tweeted by editor-in-chief Hu Xijin) and their aftermath. JMonkey2006 (talk) 11:10, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – She's reappeared, online at least. End of story? – Sca (talk) 13:34, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Strong support Wide coverage by RSes and notable. Fakescientist8000 (talk) 14:05, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Still too murky and speculative, with little general impact. – Sca (talk) 15:24, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Leaving aside anything else, there is video evidence of her out and about so she hasn't been "disappeared" and isn't "missing". Whether or not something else is happening is in the realm of speculation, and would require a separate blurb. Also, very large swathes of the article on her career lack even a single citation. Is it not time to close this as no consensus already? Preceding posted by User:BSMRD – Sca (talk) 17:35, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: – Discussion tops 1,500 words. Posts running 4:3 against. – Sca (talk) 17:42, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Comment as nominator I'm willing to close soon now there's video of her alive (barring any big development, like it rapidly emerging this is an impersonator). Someone being in big trouble with their government isn't ITN-worthy, although I still think someone being forced-disappeared could be.

This applies to a high percentage of the content we post and is unproductive." "International notability" is not a criteria for posting at ITN, nor has it ever been. --Jayron32 19:05, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Well my direct opinion is that it is not notable. My reasoning is the discussion that already took place on the 2021 talk page. I also have previous discussions months ago where things highly notable to one country aren’t included. Elijahandskip (talk) 19:11, 19 November 2021 (UTC) This is not a discussion of the page 2021. The criteria established for other parts of Wikipedia don't apply here. If you wish to change the criteria used for the ITN box, then start a discussion at WT:ITN. Votes without valid rationales are given little weight. It's fine if you have a useful rationale, but merely "I don't think it's notable enough" does not provide any useful guidance to admins when deciding consensus. I mean, you're allowed to say any silly thing you want, I suppose, but you can't expect anyone to take you seriously if it isn't valid. --Jayron32 19:18, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Well since you don’t like my reasoning, just let me say “no”. People have supported ITN’s in the past without giving a reason, so my “Oppose” in this case will not have a reason. Elijahandskip (talk) 19:22, 19 November 2021 (UTC) As I said, it's a free world. People do nonsensical things all of the time. --Jayron32 19:24, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Yep, I couldn’t agree more. In reality, my oppose on this comes more to combat American Wikipedia vs English Wikipedia. There is a essay on Wikipedia that I recently read that has that meaning. Not everything that happens in America is notable for Wikipedia/2021/ITN/Portal Current Events, etc….Elijahandskip (talk) 19:34, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose (at least on news of just the verdict). It was a highly watched case in the U.S., but it was clear early on to many legal experts that are crying foul on judicial behavior. It is very very likely to see an appeal and so this is not the end. This is not like the result from the very public George Floyd protests (which we posted and had ongoing about those, and the verdict). That said, there had been concerns there may be rioting following an acquittal , and while I'm not seeing any immediate news on that, a major riot (akin to the LA riots after King's verdict) would likely be the newsworthy factor here. --Masem (t) 19:05, 19 November 2021 (UTC) There literally cannot be any appeal of a not guilty verdict. This is a core principle of how double jeopardy is handled in American jurisprudence. A not guilty jury verdict is basically always final. See [12]. There are some exceedingly rare exceptions to this, but none of them would apply in this case. An ordinary jury verdict of "not guilty" like this one (even in a controversial trial) is treated as basically sacrosanct, and there can be no appeals by the government. --Jayron32 19:08, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Except for the calls for a mistrial that are being entered now. I know there's complexities with double jeopardy there, but that's still on the books and that itself can be a legal process. --Masem (t) 19:15, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Um, what? There were calls for a mistrial by Rittenhouse's defense team prior to the jury verdict coming back. Now that the verdict is in their client's favor, I doubt highly they will press forward with these requests. Indeed, articles such as this one note "The verdict also meant that Judge Bruce Schroeder did not have to rule on the defense's motions for a mistrial." --Jayron32 19:23, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose as above. If we had to have an American court psychodrama today, the better option from a world-historical perspective would probably be the acquittal of the purported killers of Malcolm X. —Brigade Piron (talk) 19:20, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose AGF, but this is such a small story in the grand scheme. GreatCaesarsGhost 19:23, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Wait. It is too early to tell what impact this will have. It could be a Rodney King-like result where acquittal of the accused leads to broad social unrest, or it could pass with a shrug. I expect that we will know within 24 hours.

I wonder if we should put this blurb up now, or when Parliament repeals them and the farmers go home (don't have strong opinions either way, but I lean towards waiting). If we're going to put it up now, I've uploaded this screengrab of Modi's announcement from his CC-BY YouTube channel; we could use it. Btw Indefensible - Dracophyllum was the only updater, not DiplomatTesterMan. Kind regards, W. Tell DCCXLVI (talk to me!/c) 07:05, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Using the update to put back in ongoing instead of a final blurb would be fine too if preferable. And DiplomatTesterMan did more updates on the article before that, he still deserves some credit too I think. - Indefensible (talk) 07:12, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose because the article is not sufficiently updated. There is currently a 1 sentence mention in the lead of the repeal of the laws, and no mention of it, nor of any follow-on protests, anywhere in the body of the article. Before this can be posted, the latest developments would need to be added to the article appropriately. --Jayron32 12:18, 19 November 2021 (UTC) @Jayron32 Have you read the repeal section? Dracophyllum 20:10, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Your response is 8 hours after Jayron32's, Dracophyllum. The section may have not existed when Jayron commented. But then again, I am not going to take the time to check if it did exist at 12:18 PM UTC on 19 Nov 2021. Tube·of·Light 02:30, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: The announcement by itself has no legal value. Parliament has to repeal the laws, which it will probably do in the coming Winter Session. Also some farmer's unions are continuing protests until the laws are repealed and minimum support prices reconsidered. So it might be better to wait, but no strong opinion either way. --Jose Mathew (talk) 12:24, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Wait and see what the impact of this is.

India-centric Very India centric. It's probably not even the most important news in India right now, let alone the world.

In fact, we do post many India-centric stories here, this one having festered in ongoing for nearly a year. --LaserLegs (talk) 23:36, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support. Invariably it is announcements that get more attention than the actual act, most of the time(we post elections when the result is known, not when the results are official/certified). If Modi renegs, that will likely be newsworthy itself. 331dot (talk) 23:16, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Weak oppose - as Wilhelm Tell DCCXLVI says, the BKU is still protesting. I would prefer waiting till the laws are actually repealed (and FWIW, these laws are being repealed just before the 2022 Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly elections and elections in some other states, which are crucial for Modi's political party). Tube·of·Light 02:30, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – On article quality – and as others have noted because the laws haven't taken effect.

The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 21:41, 19 November 2021 (UTC) You're forgetting that lunar eclipses often presage globally cataclysmic events, such as permanent cancellation of The Boat Race, which I fear may now be in the offing for 2022. – Sca (talk) 13:30, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Of course, lunar eclipses and the Boat Race are entirely unrelated. And of course, there will be no "permanent cancellation of The Boat Race", that's total bollocks, but perhaps inline with your regular contributions. As you perhaps should know already, The Boat Race 2022 is scheduled for next year, and if COVID stymies it, one imagines it will simply be moved to the River Great Ouse once again. I'm unclear as to where you think that a lunar eclipse would be a portent for the permanent cancellation of an event which has been conducted since 1829, even before the Third Reich failed to play nicely. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 17:56, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Ease up, Ramblo, it was a joke. (And BTW, the Third Reich and this topic are entirely unrelated.) – Sca (talk) 18:26, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Yeah, and this topic and the Boat Race are completely unrelated. And it wasn't funny in any sense. So explain yourself. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 18:45, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support, this lunar eclipse has gotten significant news coverage. Both visibility paragraphs each have a single reference at the end. -- Tavix (talk) 16:01, 20 November 2021 (UTC) The discussion above is closed. Please do not modify it.

Power outage and a small death toll won't cut it. --PFHLai (talk) 22:35, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Comment - this is quite a significant event in Canada, with reports that it could become the most expensive natural disaster in Canadian history [16], the death toll is expected to rise, along with wide ranging effects on supply chains and transportation networks. If I recall correctly, I think we did post the 2013 Alberta floods, for precedent. Connormah (talk) 22:39, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I guess "could be" is key here. If it does become the most expensive natural disaster after electing Trudeau in the history of Canada, then it's well placed for a blurb. Maybe now is premature. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:42, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Wait Living through this, it's a pretty devastating disaster, with all road access cut off to and from the Port of Vancouver, which is having a major impact on supply chains across Western Canada. But I don't think this meets the standard previously set for ITN just yet, although there are reports that the death toll is expected to rise. There's also reports of an imminent dike breach into a large city. As such, I'd suggest that we wait.

[17] CaffeinAddict (talk) 23:11, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, just “affected” the fourth in North America. Not America. Not even in the world. Let's not overestimate it.

Admin instructions are here. ??Skip to suggestions In the news toolbox Error reports Nominations (Archives) Discussion General criteria Death criteria Recurring items Admin guide Image protection Current events portal v t e Shortcut WP:ITN/C This page provides a forum for editors to suggest items for inclusion on In the news (ITN), a protected template on the Main Page, as well as the forum for discussion of candidates. This is not the page to report errors in the ITN section on the Main Page—please go to the appropriate section at WP:ERRORS. Archives of past nominations can be found here. This candidates page is integrated with the daily pages of Portal:Current events. Under each daily section header below is the transcluded Portal:Current events items for that day (with a light green header). Each day's portal page is followed by a subsection for suggestions and discussion. A blurb is a one sentence summary of the news story. An alternate suggestion for the blurb is called an altblurb, and any more suggestions get labelled alt1, alt2, etc. A blurb needs at least one target article, highlighted in bold; reviewers check the quality of that article and whether it is updated, and whether reliable sources demonstrate the significance of the event. Other articles can also be linked. The Ongoing line is for regularly updated articles which cover events that remain in the news over a longer period of time. RD stands for the "recent deaths" line, and can include any living thing whose death was recently announced. In some cases, recent deaths may need additional explanation as provided by a blurb; this is decided by consensus.

Find the correct section below for the date of the event (not the date nominated). Do not add sections for new dates. These are automatically generated (at midnight UTC) by a bot; creating them manually breaks this process. Nominate the blurb for ITN inclusion under the "Suggestions" subheading for the date, emboldening the link in the blurb to the updated article. Use a level 4 header (====) when doing so. Preferably use the template {{ITN candidate}} to nominate the article related to the event in the news. Make sure that you include a reference from a verifiable, reliable secondary source. Press releases are not acceptable. The suggested blurb should be written in simple present tense. Adding an explanation why the event should be posted greatly increases the odds of posting. Please consider alerting editors to the nomination by adding the template {{ITN note}} to the corresponding article's talk page. Purge this page to update the cache There are criteria which guide the decision on whether or not to put a particular item on In the news, based largely on the extensiveness of the updated content and the perceived significance of the recent developments. These are listed at WP:ITN. Submissions that do not follow the guidelines at Wikipedia:In the news will not be placed onto the live template. Headers[edit] Items that have been posted or pulled from the main page are generally marked with (Posted) or (Pulled) in the item's subject so it is clear they are no longer active. Items can also be marked as (Ready) when the article is both updated and there seems to be a consensus to post. The posting admin, however, should always judge the update and the consensus to post themselves. If you find an entry that you don't feel is ready to post is marked (Ready), you should remove the mark in the header. Voicing an opinion on an item[edit] Format your comment to contain "support" or "oppose", and include a rationale for your choice. In particular, address the notability of the event, the quality of the article, and whether it has been updated. Please do not...[edit] add simple "support!" or "oppose!" votes without including your reasons. Similarly, curt replies such as "who?", "meh", or "duh!" are usually not helpful. Instead, explain the reasons why you think the item meets or does not meet the ITN inclusion criteria so a consensus can be reached. oppose an item because the event is only relating to a single country, or failing to relate to one. This applies to a high percentage of the content we post and is unproductive. accuse other editors of supporting, opposing or nominating due to a personal bias (such as ethnocentrism).

(Radio Sweden) (Reuters) Murder of Ahmaud Arbery verdict[edit] Article: Murder of Ahmaud Arbery (talk · history · tag) Blurb: ?All three men, George McMichael, Travis McMichael, and William Bryan Jr., are found guilty in the Murder of Ahmaud Arbery (Post) News source(s): CNN, The New York Times BBC Credits: Nominated by Andise1 (talk · give credit) Article updated Nominator's comments: Ending to a major court case related to racial issues in the US. Andise1 (talk) 20:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Is it really necessary to discuss such a case again? I refer to here. Yet another case with zero international impact and interest, yet another case of a purely local trial. Far from being akin to the conviction for the murder of George Floyd. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 20:46, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Alsoriano97 If "international impact" was required for postings, very little would be posted. 331dot (talk) 20:47, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, but it should be much more decisive when it comes to court rulings than in other cases (sports, science, elections...). If the follow-up of a trial has a very low international coverage/interest, will you tell me that it's not an important requirement to take into account when determining whether a court case is blurb-worthy or not? So many people are condemned every day in this world... _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 20:58, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Respectfully, we aren't talking about someone convicted of robbing the corner store, but a black man who was murdered basically for being in the wrong neighborhood in a part of the United States where convictions for this sort of thing are rare. And as I said, this incident has influenced changes in laws. 331dot (talk) 21:55, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, laws of a single U.S. state (as far as I know). If it were at the federal level I might come to support it, but not at this one. And many are the events that trigger legislative changes. And without a doubt, the article is in excellent shape. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 22:35, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support. This was a highly followed trial in the US, and even before the verdict this incident resulted in changes in Georgia law(the elimination of citizens' arrests). 331dot (talk) 20:52, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Article is also of decent quality from what I can see. 331dot (talk) 20:57, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support -- this verdict is likely to influence future trials of this type in the United States, and it is an historic decision in an area of the country known for its virulent racism. I doubt a jury would have reached this verdict in that area even 20 years ago. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 21:47, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support High profile case with notable legal impact, quality article. SpencerT•C 21:55, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support. This is a newsworthy verdict, and the article is in good shape from a skim-through. -- Tavix (talk) 21:56, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose people found guilty of crime that they themselves were stupid enough to video. Seriously. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:18, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose It's gotten a lot of attention for emotional reasons, and on a human level the crime was shocking. But its long-term significance is likely to be minimal. People are murdered every day all over the world. Some get a lot of press attention. We almost never post them. -Ad Orientem (talk) 22:25, 24 November 2021 (UTC) It's already had long term significance, both legally and perhaps socially. This was not a garden variety murder. I don't understand this line of thinking more generally. If this event is not notable due to not having "long term significance", it should be proposed for deletion. 331dot (talk) 22:31, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Not at all, there does exist a middle ground between ITN and AFD. This is a prime example. It's the result of a clear-cut murder case which the perps videoed themselves. A no-brainer. What would have been newsworthy would have been this ending in a non-guilty verdict and the no-doubt ensuing riots. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:34, 24 November 2021 (UTC) They taped it because they were in their mind attempting to make a citizens arrest(which was banned after this incident) even though they had no evidence of a crime. And in Georgia and elsewhere this is, rightly or wrongly, not clear cut. Even 15 years ago these men might have got off. And there was doubt Derek Chauvin would be convicted for killing George Floyd even though that was on video. 331dot (talk) 22:45, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, it's nuanced and emotive but ultimately it's just another crime story. It's been whipped up with publicity and is precisely the reason that we need to apply some common sense to these kinds of nominations. It is of minimal long term significance. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:49, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support Article is in good shape, well referenced, and story is currently being adequately covered by reliable sources. Meets all requirements. --Jayron32 22:38, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Similar to the Rittenhouse verdict - limited notability, outcome that isn't nationally or globally significant in any game-changing or important way.

Whilst? – Sca (talk) 19:58, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose for now. Article is not developed enough to be ready for the main page. If that is fixed, it can be posted. Also, none of the blurbs link the article. That will need to be fixed. --Jayron32 20:04, 24 November 2021 (UTC) fixed now Llewee (talk) 21:01, 24 November 2021 (UTC) (Removed) Ongoing removal: 2021 Belarus–European Union border crisis[edit] Article: 2021 Belarus–European Union border crisis (talk · history · tag) Ongoing item removal (Post) Nominator's comments: The article has not has any significant updates for a week, and thus fails the ongoing criteria: In order to be posted to ongoing, the article needs to be regularly updated with new, pertinent information. If there have been significant updates in the last week, these should be added, but right now, this article fails the ongoing criteria. In particular, the last significant update is older than the day of the oldest ITN event (21 November), which is a general rule for something not being updated enough for Ongoing. Joseph2302 (talk) 12:26, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Remove. I think Belarus cleared out migrants from the border; Putin must think he made his point. 331dot (talk) 12:28, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Remove. The migrants have been moved away from the border and the situation has calmed down. No longer an ongoing event. Modest Genius talk 13:05, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – Although the situation appears to have been at least partially defused, there have been reports in recent days that in some cases Belorussian guards have continued to help migrants breach the border into Polish territory. [1], [2] [3] – Sca (talk) 13:27, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Remove the existence of news coverage that Sca notes is a necessary but not sufficient condition for maintaining an ongoing link. The article also needs to have been continuously updated. That clearly didn't happen here. --Jayron32 20:06, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – I have read the reports mentioned by Sca. It appears as if the situation have slowed down, but not ended. So still Ongoing.BabbaQ (talk) 20:23, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Removed. SpencerT•C 21:57, 24 November 2021 (UTC) (Posted) Magdalena Andersson[edit] Article: Magdalena Andersson (talk · history · tag) Blurb: ?Magdalena Andersson (pictured) is elected by the Riksdag as the first female Prime Minister of Sweden. (Post) Alternative blurb: ?Following the resignation of Stefan Löfven, Magdalena Andersson (pictured) is elected by the Riksdag as the first female Prime Minister of Sweden. Alternative blurb II: ?Magdalena Andersson (pictured) is elected as the first female Prime Minister of Sweden. News source(s): BBC Credits: Nominated by BastianMAT (talk · give credit) Article updated The nominated event is listed on WP:ITN/R, so each occurrence is presumed to be important enough to post. Comments should focus on whether the quality of the article and update meet WP:ITNCRIT, not the significance. Nominator's comments: ITNR, as it falls under "Changes in the holder of the office which administer the executive of their respective state/government, in those countries which qualify under the criteria above, as listed at List of current heads of state and government except when that change was already posted as part of a general election". First female prime minister of Sweden. BastianMAT (talk) 09:59, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment she takes office on the 26th (according to her article). Until that point, the blurb isn't correct, as she only becomes the first female PM of Sweden on that date. Is it usual to post when it's announced, or when they take office? Joseph2302 (talk) 10:04, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Usually when they are elected but yeah with the blurb of being elected. BastianMAT (talk) 10:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support - First female PM in Sweden. But change blurb to ”is elected” instead becomes.BabbaQ (talk) 10:06, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Yes. BastianMAT (talk) 10:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support Significant as new PM and first female. Perhaps the blub should be "elected by the Riksdag" since she didn't gain office through a normal election (by the people). cart-Talk 10:15, 24 November 2021 (UTC) That's normal in a parliamentary system. – Sca (talk) 15:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment The blurb should probably start with "Following the resignation of Stefan Löfven, ..." to provide context, since this was not an election outcome but a government reshuffle. --Tone 10:20, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support now the blurb has been changed to "is elected" seems fine to run now. Agree with Tone that we should make it clearer that this wasn't an election that caused this. Joseph2302 (talk) 11:01, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support Her article looks great, is ITNR and altblurb, although somewhat long, it's the most complete and clear of all. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 11:31, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Posting. --Tone 11:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Would suggest that we use the image of Andersson at the front page.BabbaQ (talk) 11:49, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Agree with this, we usually use the image for the newest blurb. Joseph2302 (talk) 14:32, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Post-posting support This is historic. -TenorTwelve (talk) 14:30, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Since Sweden's in the EU, perhaps she'll become the next Merkel. – Sca (talk) 15:25, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Then again, maybe not. – Sca (talk) 20:01, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Update by the nominator Things are looking bad for her and her party now. The Center Party (liberal) voted for the opposition’s budget and it got through. The Center party did not agree with the goverment’s budget, stating it was way too left. That would mean Magdallena now has to rule with right wing economic politics, which she accepted. However their junior party the Green party did not accept it and have left the goverment meaning a new Riksdag election for the prime minister post shall be held. Interesting development. SVT BastianMAT (talk) 16:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Update 2 by nominator Magdallena Andersson has officially resigned. We might have to pull the news back as she won’t be assuming office. She will only assume office if she wins a new prime minister vote, which might take place in a few days/weeks, depending on how the talks with the speaker goes. SVT BastianMAT (talk) 16:46, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Pull (or update the blurb). Her resignation is quickly making international news. 142.182.136.105 (talk) 17:38, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Update blurb Move over Kim Campbell, there's a new sheriff in town. Or more precisely, there was one for a few hours.Scaramouche33 (talk) 17:58, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Pull until it's confirmed whether she will now be the leader or not. Joseph2302 (talk) 18:01, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose pull What is ITNR is that a few hours ago she has been elected by the Swedish parliament. However much she has resigned. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 18:20, 24 November 2021 (UTC) What updating with "and immediately resigns" or something? This is a really weird sequence of events. --Tone 18:21, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Pull - The blurb, as it currently stands, is false.--WaltCip-(talk) 18:50, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Updated to Magdalena Andersson (pictured), shortly after being elected as the first female prime minister of Sweden, resigns. Any further changes, please? --PFHLai (talk) 19:13, 24 November 2021 (UTC) I think this is fine now. --Tone 19:25, 24 November 2021 (UTC) I'm not a big fan of blurbs that contemplate the resignation of a prime minister...But knowing a bit of precedent, it's very likely that in a few days/weeks she will be re-elected, as happened with Löfven in the middle of this year. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 19:48, 24 November 2021 (UTC) For the record, I support this new blurb. It will work until she is finally elected the new PM in a few days or at the longest a week.BabbaQ (talk) 20:21, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks. Hopefully, we'll have an update about her taking office soon. That would be a simple update to do. --PFHLai (talk) 20:31, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Pull -- wait until she actually is seated. She just resigned. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 21:22, 24 November 2021 (UTC) The blurb already says that. It's fine. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 21:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) It's probably just my own bias here; but it seems silly to post this when she just resigned. Forming coalition governments in a parliamentary system is weird. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 21:45, 24 November 2021 (UTC) It's a fascinating and encyclopedic story. Unlike the myriad legal cases being spewed out of the US these days.

But it's in the news now. Andrew?(talk) 08:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support important mission with global implications, good article. Polyamorph (talk) 08:18, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment. This may be notable as the first mission of its type (to post now); it will be ITNR when it arrives as well. Just saying. 331dot (talk) 08:19, 24 November 2021 (UTC) This may be ITN/R per "first ... launches of any type of rocket" as it's the first mission to use the NEXT drive but that's debatable. Andrew?(talk) 10:09, 24 November 2021 (UTC) The NEXT is the thruster on the spacecraft, not the rocket that put it up there(a Falcon 9). 331dot (talk) 12:31, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Such missions usually have multiple stages and each stage has separate rocket engines. The first stage is usually more spectacular but there's no scientific reason to prefer it. For deep space missions lasting years, the efficiency of the final spacecraft will be most important and this is a new design. Andrew?(talk) 12:54, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support important global mission (even if it does sound like DART is copying the plot of Salvation (TV series)). Added 3 cn tags to article, but apart from that, it looks more than good enough article quality for the front page. Joseph2302 (talk) 09:13, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support Everyone in the world should be happy we'll finally have a way to stop any doomsday asteroids from wiping us all out. Dream Focus 11:15, 24 November 2021 (UTC) If it works, of course... _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 11:39, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Support is ITNR from what Andrew says and the global impact of this mission is undoubted, so it's clearly notable. In fact I think it should be one of the most important scientific news of the year. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 11:39, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Global impact?? I thought the idea was to avoid that! Martinevans123 (talk) 13:52, 24 November 2021 (UTC) This event can't be notable, its only impact is on a small unpopulated asteroid! WaltCip-(talk) 14:17, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Impactfulness nonapparent at this pt. in time & space. – Sca (talk) 15:00, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment the proposed blurb is a mess. I've added alt1, though for some reason that's messing up the template formatting - I can't work out why. Modest Genius talk 13:11, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Also, this is not ITNR, as it's not a new type of rocket and interplanetary probes are ITNR when they arrive at their destination, not when launched.

Modest Genius talk 13:44, 24 November 2021 (UTC) The fact that the mission is attempting to alter the course of the asteroid makes this particularly notable. Added alt2. Polyamorph (talk) 13:40, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Alt2 is incorrect. It won't 'deflect the course' of the asteroid. The impact will modify orbit of the moon around the asteroid, not either of their orbits around the Sun. Modest Genius talk 13:44, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Dimorphos is an asteroid (albeit a minor one compared to Didymos). It will deflect its course. Nothing to do with the Sun. Polyamorph (talk) 13:46, 24 November 2021 (UTC) It may deflect its course. – Sca (talk) 15:06, 24 November 2021 (UTC) It will deflect it, even if by only a negligible amount. But this is covered by the wording of alt2 "on a mission to attempt to deflect the course". Polyamorph (talk) 15:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – From what I've seen, this is such a complicated, long-term project that any significant results may be years off. – Sca (talk) 13:30, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose - no mention of Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck or Michael Bay.

The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 10:35, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Over a million people die on the roads every year – that's over 3,000 every day. The coverage of this case says that "there were often accidents in the area". It's routine. Andrew?(talk) 14:17, 23 November 2021 (UTC) There may have been many accidents, even some fatalities.

Joseph2302 (talk) 08:35, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Not terrorism, according to "sources", so whilst tragic, it appears to be a worse-than-usual crime gone wrong. Black Kite (talk) 08:44, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support -- It seems that around five people died in the attack. The perpetrator has been reported by a few media outlets as Daniel Brooks, a black man who raps under the name "MathboiFly" and has tons of social media posts supporting BLM, and this was in the aftermath of a very notable event where Rittenhouse was cleared as killing two black men in self-defence. OldPeace7068 (talk) 09:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Complete extrapolation. Police have said they believe he was on the run having committed a separate crime, nothing to do with Rittenhouse at all. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 09:35, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Wikipedia is there to report the facts. Police and many members of the public initially considered the possibility of Islamic terrorism due to similar incidents in the past involving Muslims, the targeting of a western festival, and the recent rise in Islamic terrorist activity, but police have now confirmed that this is not terrorism related. Similarly, there have been widespread links/controversy made between the rapper and his connections to BLM, and it has been linked to Rittenhouse whether you like it or not. It is part of the story. The killer is a major supporter and activist of BLM. And this happened in the aftermath of Rittenhouse's acquittal. It's all part of the background and developing story. OldPeace7068 (talk) 09:45, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Not at all. The police have stated he was fleeing a separate scene. Conflating this with BLM/Rittenhouse is pure crystal balling. Thanks. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 09:47, 22 November 2021 (UTC) "two black men" and you'd think we were on a website about facts... CharredWaffle (talk) 14:04, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. Calling this an "attack" may be a misnomer as it appears that the suspect was fleeing the police, not that it was a preplanned attack or terrorism. 331dot (talk) 12:50, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Maybe so. OTOH, at least one report quotes a witness as saying the vehicle seemed to be "targeting people" as it veered from side to side. Also, reports say it crashed through barriers to reach the parade, which seems to indicate that it was indeed an attack, though possibly not a pre-planned one. – Sca (talk) 16:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment The blurb should (and currently does not) mention the country in which this event took place. Chrisclear (talk) 12:56, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose - It's not at all clear that this is an act of terrorism, and thus not something that would be imminently notable.--WaltCip-(talk) 13:09, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose both on merit and article quality. As of this comment, the incident does not appear to have been a deliberate attack. I would be open to reconsideration if contrary information comes to light.

This doesn't mean motiveless events can't ever be posted but I would expect the results to be more devasting (like the various major building fires or collapses that we had). --Masem (t) 16:36, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Exactly, I think the same Masem. _-_Alsoriano97 (talk) 17:30, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Wait – As an AP update seems to suggest this was the act of a lone nutcase with a record, I've withdrawn my provisonal support. However, it seems we're still in a wait situation, since nine of the injured are listed in critical condition. If the toll were to rise to double digits, we might still want to consider a blurb about this very nasty event. – Sca (talk) 18:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support if the motivation turns out to be terrorism, neutral if otherwise. Mlb96 (talk) 19:04, 22 November 2021 (UTC) A post – by an IT user with no other contributions – on our article's talk page posits racial motivation. Seems highly dubious at this point, though. – Sca (talk) 19:08, 22 November 2021 (UTC) See WP:RS. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 19:11, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Please see expanded comment above. Thanks. – Sca (talk) 19:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support. This event is in the news and the article looks to be in good shape. -- Tavix (talk) 19:38, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: – Since perp's been ID'd & police say he'll face five counts of first-degree intentional homicide, this is looking potentially more significant. – Sca (talk) 20:02, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Per The Independent this guy had a domestic dispute, and drove his car like a lunatic. Not terror-related, just an idiot behind the wheel. Not significant, tragic, but will never make the top 1000 things that happened on Planet Earth in 2021, let alone the top 250. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support - a mass-casualty event, receiving international coverage (e.g., BBC), a suspect is being charged, and the article has been improved to sufficient quality. Levivich 20:04, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Support - rare (even in the US) mass-casualty event. Article quality is decent. Destroyeraa (Alternate account) 20:28, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment a road traffic accident in the US is not rare. Mass-casualty events in the US are far from rare. It's pretty obvious that giving this tragic yet non-terrorist/non-BLM/non-protest/non-deliberate accident undue prominence is not what the encyclopedia was designed to do. Of course, you can dig into the BBC website and find coverage, it's all "shock and think of the children" in the US, but the rest of the world has moved on the moment it was clear it was a sad instance of a crime somewhere else having shitty side-effects, and literally nothing more. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) The last time I remember a similar incident happened in the US was late 2017 when somebody plowed into a crowd in Virginia after a violent demonstration got broken up. We posted the event that it was tangentially related to, largely on the strength of somebody plowing their car into a crowd and killing someone. You supported posting it. Rockphed (talk) 01:03, 23 November 2021 (UTC) If you're referring to Charlottesville car attack, that was about a man deliberately setting out to ram people. This is about a man trying to escape the scene of a domestic incident and getting into a road traffic accident. The two are incomparable. But good try. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 08:07, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Agreeing with previous posters, posting this event would seem to be giving undue weight to a tragic traffic accident. Comparison with the Charlottesville incident from several years back is unfair, given the explicitly political motivations of the earlier event. Wizardoftheyear (talk) 01:17, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Neutral and Wait Yes, with the additional details that have come to light, this is literally a domestic issue that had decidedly more tragic consequences. However, that is additional details. The initial response, and the fact there were several fatalities during a celebration, caught on camera and shared around the world before anyone knew what was going on, has made this major news and a source of intrigue. I think we need to wait to see if the news stations drop their coverage now that there is less intrigue and crisis; if it has effectively left the news cycle by end of day, take this as an oppose, but if it is still on the news banners, take this as support. Kingsif (talk) 01:42, 23 November 2021 (UTC) 4 of the 12 paragraphs in this article start "On November 2X". Typical anti-American bias from the Brits (which is far from rare) notwithstanding, the quality is not there yet. GreatCaesarsGhost 02:23, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Support - Tragic, criminally-induced mass-casualty. Significant details are now known. CoatCheck (talk) 03:03, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Wait It's very clear that there won't be consensus as is, but there may be more of one as things develop. Wait for now. DarkSide830 (talk) 03:46, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Strong Support. This is the deadliest vehicle ramming incident in the United States or Canada since 2018 and the deadliest in the US since 2017. 142.182.136.105 (talk) 07:37, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Comment I see there's been a tragic bus crash in Bulgaria which has killed at least 45 people. It would be safe to presume that supporters of this accident would support the posting of the Bulgarian crash, right? The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 08:09, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Nominate an article on it so that I can assess the quality. Without knowing what we are posting on the main page, it is impossible for me to know if the article is appropriate. --Jayron32 12:56, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Four hours ago....

Leaning toward support, for all the diff that would make here. – Sca (talk) 13:49, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Support for multiple fatalities, high number of serious injuries, and widespread news coverage. Jehochman Talk 13:50, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose A tragic event, but it is not a mass-casualty event. ArsenalGhanaPartey (talk) 14:11, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Comment - We have support and oppose !votes that directly contradict each other in terms of the notability of this event. Some say this is very notable. Others say this is not at all notable. How is an admin supposed to derive consensus from this? --WaltCip-(talk) 15:05, 23 November 2021 (UTC) By executive fiat. – Sca (talk) 15:44, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Well most of the support votes are from Americans (of those who have userpages), and almost all of the opposes are from non-Americans. So I guess it'll be a coin toss on whether an American or non-American admin decides... Joseph2302 (talk) 15:49, 23 November 2021 (UTC) How about one from a neutral country, say Liechtenstein? – Sca (talk) 16:19, 23 November 2021 (UTC) I voted to oppose as an American ArsenalGhanaPartey (talk) 16:02, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Oh, you must be from Manchester, N.H., then. – Sca (talk) 16:24, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. This at first got attention because it might have been terrorism related, no problem there. But all we are left with now is an accident which leaves 5 death: while tragic, this is sadly an everyday occurrence. We have e.g. this week a ferry accident in Sri Lanka (at least 6 death)[5], 7 death in Greece when migrants flee the police[6], 22 deaths on Lake Kivu[7], nine deaths in a fire in Bulgaria[8], 10 deaths in China after a car crash[9], ... I see no reason to post this, as it is not exceptional, has no lasting importance, and isn't even very interesting (without the terrorism angle). It's a sad tragedy, but a very common one. Fram (talk) 17:03, 23 November 2021 (UTC) I think it is WP:TOOSOON to make a determination as to whether this was an act of terror or not. Terrorism or not, the ramming appears to be deliberate, and it has made national and international headlines. Aasim (talk) 06:53, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. Per Fram, tragic, but not significant enough at a global scale: we don't even have articles about many similar tragedies elsewhere. Vanamonde (Talk) 17:45, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose.

Major election in an EU member state. – Illegitimate Barrister (talk • contribs), 02:46, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Question Do we post presidential elections even if the president has mostly symbolic roles? Scaramouche33 (talk) 07:32, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, heads of state elections are posted even if they are ceremonial/wield little power, it mostly depends on the article quality itself which should be more than sufficient. Two examples are the Italian presidental election and Czech presidental election, both having similar powers to the Bulgarian one. [10] [11] BastianMAT (talk) 09:02, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Weak support this article has been on front page for a week already, but I guess the second round presidency vote means that it's ITN eligible again. Article looks to have been sufficiently updated about the presidential second round vote. Joseph2302 (talk) 12:10, 22 November 2021 (UTC) This is not ITNR. We no longer post all elections for head of state- we post the election/choosing of the official with actual executive power, according to List of current heads of state and government; in Bulgaria that is the PM, not the president. 331dot (talk) 12:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) In which case, I oppose this nomination, and it shouldn't have been tagged as ITNR. Joseph2302 (talk) 12:37, 22 November 2021 (UTC) In fairness, it is a recent change that not everyone may be aware of. 331dot (talk) 12:41, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Alright, I thought going by older posts that head of state elections are still part of ITNR but if its been removed, no problem and thanks for the headsup for future nominations. BastianMAT (talk) 12:46, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I just saw this now. I must have missed the change or forgot about it. So my comment on other presidents is not relevant here. --Tone 17:49, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Exactly, that’s what got me confused to when I ITNR nominated this. In the past as you and I mentioned, similar head of state elections (with similar powers) such as Moldova(November 2020), Germany, Austria, Italy, Czech Republic have been posted. 331dot said the removal of ceremonial head of state elections from ITNR were ’recently’ done, so the change must have not been too long ago for us to not know that.BastianMAT (talk) 18:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Blurb on MainPage was updated and moved up --PFHLai (talk) 13:11, 22 November 2021 (UTC) PFHLai there wasn't consensus to do this update- the presidential election is not ITNR, and there was not consensus here that it's important enough for ITN. We should leave it where it is, so it can roll off soon, instead of moving it up so it'll stay on ITN for another week... Joseph2302 (talk) 13:27, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Post posting support If the election was stand-alone, we would probably post it. This is just the case where the general election were held together with the first round of presidential, so there is a single article. I don't see a problem. --Tone 14:56, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I doubt we would post this as a standalone item. He may be head of state, but he has no power. It's the Prime Minister of Bulgaria who would be posted automatically.  — Amakuru (talk) 17:18, 22 November 2021 (UTC) In fact he has been in de facto power since the 2021 April elections as he appointed his friend as acting prime minister. The de jure power he wields is similar to those in Italy and Czech Republic, where he gets to nominate the prime minister and supreme court judges, he can veto laws (although parliament can override) and he of course serves as head of state, don’t forget Bulgaria even has a vice president. In the past we have posted the Italian presidental and Czech Republic presidental elections, both are parliamantary republics too. I thought it was ITNR, but 331dot mentioned that head of state elections (where the head of state is not head of goverment) was recently removed from ITNR. Italian presidental election posted Czech Republic presidental election posted BastianMAT (talk) 17:32, 22 November 2021 (UTC) (ec) As far as I remember we post both if the articles are ok. We've posted presidents of Austria and Germany, which have a similar role, for example. Furthermore, the president of Germany is elected by Bundestag, not by a popular vote. --Tone 17:36, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Pull update and Revert back to previous version per Joseph2302. This guy is just a figure head, and we already posted the main election result. There was no reason to have bumped this up, and the result is not ITN/R so needs consensus, which it doesn't have.  — Amakuru (talk) 17:14, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Pull update and agree with above, not seeing consensus here for this to have even been posted in the first instance. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 17:21, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Beyond the issue of whether it should be on the main page, the blurb is clumsy. "In Bulgaria," is redundant. Where else but in Bulgaria would you be elected President of Bulgaria? Schwede66 17:57, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Restored old blurb. --PFHLai (talk) 18:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose pull Not a head of state change but in the same spirit This post was made by orbitalbuzzsaw gang (talk) 19:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Comment I think we need some kind of page break to restart voting. A lot of the opposition above was to the unilateral action and not the nom itself. as for me, Oppose while there are some states with significant power invested in the secondary office, this is not one of them. GreatCaesarsGhost 21:55, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I didn't particularly mind about the unilateral action myself - it was made in good faith - and my oppose is purely on the merits of the case, for much the same reasons as you.

Article: Peng Shuai (talk · history · tag) Blurb: ?Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai disappears after accusing a former Chinese Vice Premier of sexual assault. (Post) Alternative blurb: ?Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai is reported missing after accusing former Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli of sexual assault. News source(s): Guardian Credits: Nominated by Blythwood (talk · give credit) Article updatedNominator's comments: Seems to be a forced disappearance. This is a bit unusual, but has been a major news story. Disappearance section seems solid but the rest of the article on her career is less well sourced. The person has disappeared without a trace, so while it cannot be verified that this person person has died or been imprisoned, her disappearance is in itself the notable event. I wonder if this could be treated as something like the equivalent of a recent death. Blythwood (talk) 22:39, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support - Article is in good condition and the news is prominent, exceptional, and of great public interest around the world. Jehochman Talk 22:45, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose - Article appear in news, but headlines on CBC, CNN, BBC are still focused on Rittenhouse Trial for now, although this may change. Otherwise, the blurb should describe whats happening now (the reactions), that she has not been publicly heard is not ITN as that is a few days old. 99.247.176.90 (talk) 23:06, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose - I fail to see how this is any more worthy of ITN than the Rittenhouse trial, which was also not worthy of ITN. -- RockstoneSend me a message! 23:10, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Please don't oppose because you think another nomination should be posted and you don't think this one is as worthy. Judge nomination on its own merit. The two are about completely different things. -- KTC (talk) 23:12, 19 November 2021 (UTC) I don't think either are worthy of being posted. --RockstoneSend me a message! 01:20, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support per Jehochman. However I'm not quite sure about the term "disappears" here, even if I personally think the Chinese state did exactly that. -- KTC (talk) 23:16, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support per Jehochman. -- Tavix (talk) 23:20, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support this is far more notable than "another white American kills black Americans" and regardless of the fact that headlines are currently obsessing over the US proclivity to allow kids to routinely assassinate people without any kind of criminal conviction, Peng's disappearance is genuinely newsworthy and encyclopedic. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 23:23, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Not that it matters to this nomination, but Rittenhouse's victims were white. GreatCaesarsGhost 00:04, 20 November 2021 (UTC) *cough cough* Rittenhouse's victims were white *cough cough* – John M Wolfson (talk • contribs) 00:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Who said he wasn't talking about Young Dolph's routine assassin? We don't know he wasn't white. We don't know if he had other black American victims. Memphis is all about unsolved mysteries! AGF. InedibleHulk (talk) 02:06, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose on quality The article needs a lot of work, as there are multiple sections with no inline citations.Pawnkingthree (talk) 23:42, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support While this might be unduly implicative of the Chinese state being connected, if RSs are making that connection this definitely belongs. – John M Wolfson (talk • contribs) 00:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose on quality I would support this if the article has some ref work done. There's sections that are unsourced. --TDKR Chicago 101 (talk) 00:34, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose this is newsworthy for sure but blurbing that someone "disappeared" after making an accusation seems like a WP:BLPCRIME issue to me. --LaserLegs (talk) 00:39, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Completely agree it's an awkward thing to summarise in a way that fits BLP while keeping it clear why the event is notable, I'd welcome suggestions for alternative phrasing. I realise this is a fairly limited action, but for that reason I deliberately didn't link to the person she accused in the proposed blurb. Blythwood (talk) 01:57, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose as per LaserLegs, there's something wrong about posting speculation that someone disappeared straight after they made accusations. With little reliable information, this seems like a BLP issue to post it. Joseph2302 (talk) 01:47, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Far too speculative, with overtones of anti-China sentiment, and with too many unknowns. Needs far more clarification before it is posted. And a guarantee that ITN will publish a full We Were Wrong! statement and retraction on the Main page when it is found out she has just eloped with her boyfriend or girlfriend, as the case may be. HiLo48 (talk) 01:55, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Clearly if China "disappeared" her, that would be a story, but this appears to be Western nations making a demand of China and there's no hard evidence she has been killed or imprisoned or the like. We don't post this type of speculative stories. --Masem (t) 02:16, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support Per wide coverage in RSes. Normchou?? 03:22, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose unless the incident has a separate article. Sun8908?Talk 07:38, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support — article looks decent enough for ITN standards by my eye, wide coverage in RSes. If the choice of "disappears" is undesirable, then "is reported missing" might be a potential alternative (posted as altblurb). [osunpokeh/talk/contributions] 08:41, 20 November 2021 (UTC) I think that suggests she was reported missing in the police report sense, not that Novak Djokovic described her as "a missing person" to reporters. Not a bad idea. Just a bit ambiguous. InedibleHulk (talk) 09:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Strong support, in the news, top page news in many countries. The issue is she has suddenly disappeared after accusing a senior cabinet minister of a serious crime, and the involved parties are public figures indept of this incident, so there is nothing wrong as long as it is sourced and not stated as truth. Peng's disappearance and the resulting sports diplomacy pressure and boycott threats are sufficient Bumbubookworm (talk) 12:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Have you ever studied the difference between correlation and causation? HiLo48 (talk) 21:48, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Yes I have and I wonder if it's possible to have a maths competition over Wikipedia lol. I never said there was a causation, although I am sure many on Wikipedia have noted your hard-left POV eg trying to get all right of centre Australian newspapers struck off at RSN. Bumbubookworm (talk) 22:31, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Applause.

Something that may have happened isn't blurbworthy, no matter how widely it's hyped. – Sca (talk) 13:05, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose per Masem, Sca.

Polyamorph (talk) 20:03, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support per above. The article has unref'd sections about her tennis career, but the linked section is ready. Davey2116 (talk) 21:52, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose. We shouldn't (and don't) post articles with multiple unsourced sections. The fact that the section linked in bold is referenced is irrelevant. Black Kite (talk) 23:26, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Wait Let's wait until we are 100% sure what has happened to her. Heythereimaguy (talk) 23:53, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Global Times continues to point to her, this time at a restaurant with a coach and friends, seemingly quite visible. Western speculation now turns to whether she's safe, though, or free from external interference or to be believed. All very personal and hard-to-answer questions, for anybody anywhere. InedibleHulk (talk) 00:10, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose it's just one person in a world where much worse things happen in other places like Ethiopia. Banedon (talk) 01:11, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose for now. Videos of Peng Shuai have supposedly surfaced. Nice4What (talk · contribs) – (Thanks ?) 03:30, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Support However, I propose removing the term 'Chinese' in front of Peng Shuai. It does not add to her character or her identity as a professional tennis player. Something along the lines of "Professional tennis player Peng Shuai disappears after accusing former Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli of sexual assault." would be better imo. However, we should also note the videos posted by Global Times editors (primarily those tweeted by editor-in-chief Hu Xijin) and their aftermath. JMonkey2006 (talk) 11:10, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – She's reappeared, online at least. End of story? – Sca (talk) 13:34, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Strong support Wide coverage by RSes and notable. Fakescientist8000 (talk) 14:05, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Still too murky and speculative, with little general impact. – Sca (talk) 15:24, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose Leaving aside anything else, there is video evidence of her out and about so she hasn't been "disappeared" and isn't "missing". Whether or not something else is happening is in the realm of speculation, and would require a separate blurb. Also, very large swathes of the article on her career lack even a single citation. Is it not time to close this as no consensus already? Preceding posted by User:BSMRD – Sca (talk) 17:35, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: – Discussion tops 1,500 words. Posts running 4:3 against. – Sca (talk) 17:42, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Comment as nominator I'm willing to close soon now there's video of her alive (barring any big development, like it rapidly emerging this is an impersonator). Someone being in big trouble with their government isn't ITN-worthy, although I still think someone being forced-disappeared could be.

This applies to a high percentage of the content we post and is unproductive." "International notability" is not a criteria for posting at ITN, nor has it ever been. --Jayron32 19:05, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Well my direct opinion is that it is not notable. My reasoning is the discussion that already took place on the 2021 talk page. I also have previous discussions months ago where things highly notable to one country aren’t included. Elijahandskip (talk) 19:11, 19 November 2021 (UTC) This is not a discussion of the page 2021. The criteria established for other parts of Wikipedia don't apply here. If you wish to change the criteria used for the ITN box, then start a discussion at WT:ITN. Votes without valid rationales are given little weight. It's fine if you have a useful rationale, but merely "I don't think it's notable enough" does not provide any useful guidance to admins when deciding consensus. I mean, you're allowed to say any silly thing you want, I suppose, but you can't expect anyone to take you seriously if it isn't valid. --Jayron32 19:18, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Well since you don’t like my reasoning, just let me say “no”. People have supported ITN’s in the past without giving a reason, so my “Oppose” in this case will not have a reason. Elijahandskip (talk) 19:22, 19 November 2021 (UTC) As I said, it's a free world. People do nonsensical things all of the time. --Jayron32 19:24, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Yep, I couldn’t agree more. In reality, my oppose on this comes more to combat American Wikipedia vs English Wikipedia. There is a essay on Wikipedia that I recently read that has that meaning. Not everything that happens in America is notable for Wikipedia/2021/ITN/Portal Current Events, etc….Elijahandskip (talk) 19:34, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose (at least on news of just the verdict). It was a highly watched case in the U.S., but it was clear early on to many legal experts that are crying foul on judicial behavior. It is very very likely to see an appeal and so this is not the end. This is not like the result from the very public George Floyd protests (which we posted and had ongoing about those, and the verdict). That said, there had been concerns there may be rioting following an acquittal , and while I'm not seeing any immediate news on that, a major riot (akin to the LA riots after King's verdict) would likely be the newsworthy factor here. --Masem (t) 19:05, 19 November 2021 (UTC) There literally cannot be any appeal of a not guilty verdict. This is a core principle of how double jeopardy is handled in American jurisprudence. A not guilty jury verdict is basically always final. See [12]. There are some exceedingly rare exceptions to this, but none of them would apply in this case. An ordinary jury verdict of "not guilty" like this one (even in a controversial trial) is treated as basically sacrosanct, and there can be no appeals by the government. --Jayron32 19:08, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Except for the calls for a mistrial that are being entered now. I know there's complexities with double jeopardy there, but that's still on the books and that itself can be a legal process. --Masem (t) 19:15, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Um, what? There were calls for a mistrial by Rittenhouse's defense team prior to the jury verdict coming back. Now that the verdict is in their client's favor, I doubt highly they will press forward with these requests. Indeed, articles such as this one note "The verdict also meant that Judge Bruce Schroeder did not have to rule on the defense's motions for a mistrial." --Jayron32 19:23, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose as above. If we had to have an American court psychodrama today, the better option from a world-historical perspective would probably be the acquittal of the purported killers of Malcolm X. —Brigade Piron (talk) 19:20, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose AGF, but this is such a small story in the grand scheme. GreatCaesarsGhost 19:23, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Wait. It is too early to tell what impact this will have. It could be a Rodney King-like result where acquittal of the accused leads to broad social unrest, or it could pass with a shrug. I expect that we will know within 24 hours.

I wonder if we should put this blurb up now, or when Parliament repeals them and the farmers go home (don't have strong opinions either way, but I lean towards waiting). If we're going to put it up now, I've uploaded this screengrab of Modi's announcement from his CC-BY YouTube channel; we could use it. Btw Indefensible - Dracophyllum was the only updater, not DiplomatTesterMan. Kind regards, W. Tell DCCXLVI (talk to me!/c) 07:05, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Using the update to put back in ongoing instead of a final blurb would be fine too if preferable. And DiplomatTesterMan did more updates on the article before that, he still deserves some credit too I think. - Indefensible (talk) 07:12, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose because the article is not sufficiently updated. There is currently a 1 sentence mention in the lead of the repeal of the laws, and no mention of it, nor of any follow-on protests, anywhere in the body of the article. Before this can be posted, the latest developments would need to be added to the article appropriately. --Jayron32 12:18, 19 November 2021 (UTC) @Jayron32 Have you read the repeal section? Dracophyllum 20:10, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Your response is 8 hours after Jayron32's, Dracophyllum. The section may have not existed when Jayron commented. But then again, I am not going to take the time to check if it did exist at 12:18 PM UTC on 19 Nov 2021. Tube·of·Light 02:30, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: The announcement by itself has no legal value. Parliament has to repeal the laws, which it will probably do in the coming Winter Session. Also some farmer's unions are continuing protests until the laws are repealed and minimum support prices reconsidered. So it might be better to wait, but no strong opinion either way. --Jose Mathew (talk) 12:24, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Wait and see what the impact of this is.

India-centric Very India centric. It's probably not even the most important news in India right now, let alone the world.

In fact, we do post many India-centric stories here, this one having festered in ongoing for nearly a year. --LaserLegs (talk) 23:36, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Support. Invariably it is announcements that get more attention than the actual act, most of the time(we post elections when the result is known, not when the results are official/certified). If Modi renegs, that will likely be newsworthy itself. 331dot (talk) 23:16, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Weak oppose - as Wilhelm Tell DCCXLVI says, the BKU is still protesting. I would prefer waiting till the laws are actually repealed (and FWIW, these laws are being repealed just before the 2022 Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly elections and elections in some other states, which are crucial for Modi's political party). Tube·of·Light 02:30, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – On article quality – and as others have noted because the laws haven't taken effect.

The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 21:41, 19 November 2021 (UTC) You're forgetting that lunar eclipses often presage globally cataclysmic events, such as permanent cancellation of The Boat Race, which I fear may now be in the offing for 2022. – Sca (talk) 13:30, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Of course, lunar eclipses and the Boat Race are entirely unrelated. And of course, there will be no "permanent cancellation of The Boat Race", that's total bollocks, but perhaps inline with your regular contributions. As you perhaps should know already, The Boat Race 2022 is scheduled for next year, and if COVID stymies it, one imagines it will simply be moved to the River Great Ouse once again. I'm unclear as to where you think that a lunar eclipse would be a portent for the permanent cancellation of an event which has been conducted since 1829, even before the Third Reich failed to play nicely. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 17:56, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Ease up, Ramblo, it was a joke. (And BTW, the Third Reich and this topic are entirely unrelated.) – Sca (talk) 18:26, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Yeah, and this topic and the Boat Race are completely unrelated. And it wasn't funny in any sense. So explain yourself. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 18:45, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Support, this lunar eclipse has gotten significant news coverage. Both visibility paragraphs each have a single reference at the end. -- Tavix (talk) 16:01, 20 November 2021 (UTC) The discussion above is closed. Please do not modify it.

The assassination itself, of course, would have been ITN-worthy, as would the convictions of the accused. To me, this is on the same level. BD2412 T 21:30, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Just remembered it won't make DYK as much of the content was copy/pasted from the main article, and it's not 5x from that.

The two who are being exonerated are not independently notable and were released decades ago, so the actual impact is minimal.

The point is that history is not often corrected as it was here. 331dot (talk) 16:53, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Oppose – per Modest Genius.

Joseph2302 (talk) 20:40, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: Perhaps the blurb can mention the evacuation of thousands of residents and the destruction of infrastructure. Power outage and a small death toll won't cut it. --PFHLai (talk) 22:35, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Comment - this is quite a significant event in Canada, with reports that it could become the most expensive natural disaster in Canadian history [16], the death toll is expected to rise, along with wide ranging effects on supply chains and transportation networks. If I recall correctly, I think we did post the 2013 Alberta floods, for precedent. Connormah (talk) 22:39, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I guess "could be" is key here. If it does become the most expensive natural disaster after electing Trudeau in the history of Canada, then it's well placed for a blurb. Maybe now is premature. The Rambling Man (Keep wearing the mask...) 22:42, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Wait Living through this, it's a pretty devastating disaster, with all road access cut off to and from the Port of Vancouver, which is having a major impact on supply chains across Western Canada. But I don't think this meets the standard previously set for ITN just yet, although there are reports that the death toll is expected to rise. There's also reports of an imminent dike breach into a large city. As such, I'd suggest that we wait. NorthernFalcon (talk) 22:51, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Comment – Lots of damage & dislocation but so far only one fatal. – Sca (talk) 23:29, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Wait If this gets worse and deadlier, then I will support.

Modest Genius talk 13:16, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Comment I would further comment that given Port of Vancouver is affected (the fourth largest port in North America by volume of goods) the supply chain issues are pretty notable. [17] CaffeinAddict (talk) 23:11, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, just “affected” the fourth in North America. Not America. Not even in the world. Let's not overestimate it.
