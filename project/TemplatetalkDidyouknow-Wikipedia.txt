Further information: Official supplementary guidelines and unofficial guide  Warning: You are not logged in. Please create an account or log in to proceed. Alternatively, you may leave a message at the bottom of the DYK project talk page with the article you would like to nominate and the hook you would like to propose.  Warning: The helper script only works on desktop. Please switch to desktop view to continue. Install the DYK helper script by adding the line {{subst:lusc|User:SD0001/DYK-helper.js}} to your common.js page. Go back to the article, and choose the "DYK" option from the "More" menu (see image). Fill in the form and submit it. Check back periodically to address comments or concerns from the reviewer (it may take several weeks). Manual instructions[edit] Create a subpage for your new DYK suggestion and then list the page below under the date the article was created or the expansion began or it became a good article (not the date you submit it here), with the newest dates at the bottom. Any registered user may nominate a DYK suggestion (if you are not a registered user, please leave a message at the bottom of the DYK project talk page with the details of the article you would like to nominate and the hook you would like to propose); self-nominations are permitted and encouraged. Thanks for participating and please remember to check back for comments on your nomination (consider watchlisting your nomination page). Read these instructions completely before proceeding. For simplified instructions, see User:Rjanag/Quick DYK 2. I. Create the nomination subpage. Enter the article title in the box below and click the button. (To nominate multiple articles together, enter any or all of the article titles.) You will then be taken to a preloaded nomination page. II. Write the nomination. On the nomination page, fill in the relevant information. See Template:NewDYKnomination and {{NewDYKnomination/guide}} for further information. Not every line of the template needs to be filled in. For instance, if you are not nominating an image to appear with your hook, there is no need to fill in the image-related lines. Add an edit summary e.g. "Nominating YOUR ARTICLE TITLE for DYK" and click Publish page. Make sure the nomination page is on your watchlist, so you can follow the review discussion. III. Post at Template talk:Did you know. In the current nominations section find the subsection for the date on which the article was created or on which expansion began (or, if a new Good Article, the date on which it became a GA), not the date on which you make the nomination. At the top of that subsection (before other nominations already there, but below the section head and hidden comment) add {{Did you know nominations/YOUR ARTICLE TITLE}}. Add an edit summary e.g. "Nominating YOUR ARTICLE TITLE for DYK" and click Publish page. Frequently asked questions[edit] How do I write an interesting hook? Successful hooks tend to have several traits. Most importantly, they share a surprising or intriguing fact. They give readers enough context to understand the hook, but leave enough out to make them want to learn more. They are written for a general audience who has no prior knowledge of or interest in the topic area. Lastly, they are concise, and do not attempt to cover multiple facts or present information about the subject beyond what's needed to understand the hook. When will my nomination be reviewed? This page is often backlogged. As long as your submission is still on the page, it will stay there until an editor reviews it. Since editors are encouraged to review the oldest submissions first, it may take several weeks until your submission is reviewed. In the meantime, please consider reviewing another submission (not your own) to help reduce the backlog (see instructions below). Where is my hook? If you can't find the nomination you submitted to this nominations page, it may have been approved and is on the approved nominations page waiting to be promoted. It could also have been added to one of the prep areas, promoted from prep to a queue, or is on the main page. If the nominated hook is in none of those places, then the nomination has probably been rejected. Such a rejection usually only occurs if it was at least a couple of weeks old and had unresolved issues for which any discussion had gone stale. If you think your nomination was unfairly rejected, you can query this on the DYK discussion page, but as a general rule such nominations will only be restored in exceptional circumstances. Instructions for reviewers[edit] Main page: Wikipedia:Did you know/Reviewing guide Any editor who was not involved in writing/expanding or nominating an article may review it by checking to see that the article meets all the DYK criteria (long enough, new enough, no serious editorial or content issues) and the hook is cited. Editors may also alter the suggested hook to improve it, suggest new hooks, or even lend a hand and make edits to the article to which the hook applies so that the hook is supported and accurate. For a more detailed discussion of the DYK rules and review process see the supplementary guidelines and the WP:Did you know/Reviewing guide. To post a comment or review on a DYK nomination, follow the steps outlined below: Look through this page, Template talk:Did you know, to find a nomination you would like to comment on. Click the "Review or comment" link at the top of the nomination. You will be taken to the nomination subpage. The top of the page includes a list of the DYK criteria. Check the article to ensure it meets all the relevant criteria. To indicate the result of the review (i.e., whether the nomination passes, fails, or needs some minor changes), leave a signed comment on the page. Please begin with one of the 5 review symbols that appear at the top of the edit screen, and then indicate all aspects of the article that you have reviewed; your comment should look something like the following: Article length and age are fine, no copyvio or plagiarism concerns, reliable sources are used. But the hook needs to be shortened. If you are the first person to comment on the nomination, there will be a line :* <!-- REPLACE THIS LINE TO WRITE FIRST COMMENT, KEEPING  :* --> showing you where you should put the comment. Save the page. If there is any problem or concern about a nomination, please consider notifying the nominator by placing {{subst:DYKproblem|Article|header=yes|sig=yes}} on the nominator's talk page. Instructions for project members[edit] How to promote an accepted hook[edit] At-a-glance instructions on how to promote an approved hook to a Prep area See Wikipedia:Did you know/Preparation areas for details on verifying a hook's acceptability. Promoters should not promote their own nomination or their own review When promoting hooks intended for a particular date, keep in mind that when the number of available approved nominations exceeds 120 we switch to two sets per day, and when that number drops below 60 we return to one set per day. Check list for nomination review completeness 1) Select a hook from the approved nominations page that has one of these ticks at the bottom post: . 2) Check to make sure basic review requirements were completed. a. Any outstanding issue following needs to be addressed before promoting. 3) Check the article history for any substantive changes since it was nominated or reviewed. 4) Images for the lead slot must be freely licensed. Fair-use images are not permitted. Images loaded on Commons that appear on the Main Page are automatically protected by KrinkleBot. 5) Hook must be stated in both the article and source (which must be cited at the end of the article sentence where stated). 6) Hook should make sense grammatically. 7) Try to vary subject matters within each prep area. 8) Try to select a funny, quirky or otherwise upbeat hook for the last or bottom hook in the set. Steps to add a hook to prep In one tab, open the nomination page of the hook you want to promote. In a second tab, open the prep set you intend to add the hook to. 1) For hooks held for specific dates, refer to "Local update times" section on DYK Queue. a. Completed Prep area number sets will be promoted by an administrator to corresponding Queue number. 2) Copy and paste the hook into a chosen slot. a. Make sure there's a space between ... and that, and a ? at the end. b. Check that there's a bold link to the article. 3) If it's the lead (first) hook, paste the image where indicated at the top of the template. 4) Copy and paste ALL the credit information (the {{DYKmake}} and {{DYKnom}} templates) at the bottom 5) Check your work in the prep's Preview mode. a. At the bottom under "Credits", to the right of each article should have the link "View nom subpage" ; if not, a subpage parameter will need to be added to the DYKmake. 6) Save the Prep page. Closing the DYK nomination page At the upper left Change {{DYKsubpage to {{subst:DYKsubpage Change |passed= to |passed=yes At the bottom Just above the line containing }}<!--Please do not write below this line or remove this line. Place comments above this line.--> insert a new, separate line containing one of the following: To [[T:DYK/P1|Prep 1]] To [[T:DYK/P2|Prep 2]] To [[T:DYK/P3|Prep 3]] To [[T:DYK/P4|Prep 4]] To [[T:DYK/P5|Prep 5]] To [[T:DYK/P6|Prep 6]] To [[T:DYK/P7|Prep 7]] Also paste the same thing into the edit summary. Check in Preview mode. Make sure everything is against a pale blue background (nothing outside) and there are no stray characters, like }}, at the top or bottom. Save. For more information, please see T:TDYK#How to promote an accepted hook. Handy copy sources: To [[T:DYK/P1|Prep 1]] To [[T:DYK/P2|Prep 2]] To [[T:DYK/P3|Prep 3]] To [[T:DYK/P4|Prep 4]] To [[T:DYK/P5|Prep 5]] To [[T:DYK/P6|Prep 6]] To [[T:DYK/P7|Prep 7]] How to remove a rejected hook[edit] Open the DYK nomination subpage of the hook you would like to remove. (It's best to wait several days after a reviewer has rejected the hook, just in case someone contests or the article undergoes a large change.) In the window where the DYK nomination subpage is open, replace the line {{DYKsubpage with {{subst:DYKsubpage, and replace |passed= with |passed=no. Then save the page. This has the effect of wrapping up the discussion on the DYK nomination subpage in a blue archive box and stating that the nomination was unsuccessful, as well as adding the nomination to a category for archival purposes. How to remove a hook from the prep areas or queue[edit] Edit the prep area or queue where the hook is and remove the hook and the credits associated with it. Go to the hook's nomination subpage (there should have been a link to it in the credits section). View the edit history for that page Go back to the last version before the edit where the hook was promoted, and revert to that version to make the nomination active again. Add a new icon on the nomination subpage to cancel the previous tick and leave a comment after it explaining that the hook was removed from the prep area or queue, and why, so that later reviewers are aware of this issue. Add a transclusion of the template back to this page so that reviewers can see it. It goes under the date that it was first created/expanded/listed as a GA. You may need to add back the day header for that date if it had been removed from this page. If you removed the hook from a queue, it is best to either replace it with another hook from one of the prep areas, or to leave a message at WT:DYK asking someone else to do so. How to move a nomination subpage to a new name[edit] Don't; it should not ever be necessary, and will break some links which will later need to be repaired. Even if you change the title of the article, you don't need to move the nomination page. Nominations[edit] Older nominations[edit] Articles created/expanded on September 2[edit] Inger K.

(Proposed as a possible alternative by Cavalryman) ALT3:... that Inger K. Frith, the first woman president of a major international sporting federation, played a key role in returning archery to the Olympics? (proposed by PMCH2 Created by SportsOlympic (talk). Self-nominated at 14:12, 2 September 2021 (UTC). SportsOlympic has been blocked for sockpuppetry. Created by Cavalryman (talk) General: Article is new enough and long enough New Enough: Y Long Enough: Y Policy compliance: Adequate sourcing: N - Several problems here: Sources: "Olympedia – Inger K. Frith". www.olympedia.org. – this source is of questionable reliability. MRS. INGER FRITH, Olympic Review, 1971 – the link doesn’t work for me and there is inadequate bibliographic information for me to verify what it is. "Danish WW2 Pilots | Inger Kristine Frith (née Pragholm) (1909 - 1981)". www.danishww2pilots.dk. – I am satisfied a website run by Mikkel Plannthin about WWII Danish pilots is generally reliable (he has been published writing about this subject matter) but ... this seems to have been written largely from information gained in this forum thread and there is a big disclaimer at the bottom of this article raising some very significant discrepancies within the entry, which are included as fact in the article. Particularly the rank of Captain which never existed in the WAAF. I feel this raises questions about the reliability of the source. "Inger Frith blazed a trail for women in sports governance". www.insidethegames.biz. March 5, 2021. – looks reliable to me. The third paragraph in the WWII section is uncited. Filling more parameters in Template:Cite web, particularly authorship, would go a long way to presentation. Neutral: Y Free of copyright violations, plagiarism, and close paraphrasing: Y Other problems: N - The article misattributes several statements: likely the highest ranked Danish woman in service during the Second World War – the cited source states that she was the highest ranked that the author is aware of. She became a volunteer in the army in Cape Town and was later accepted for the Air Force – the cited source makes no mention of the Army. Hook eligibility: Cited: N - cites two sources with issues as described above Interesting: Y Other problems: N - perhaps base the hook on excellent insidethegames.biz article, something like “ that after serving in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War, Inger K. Frith became the first woman to lead a major international sporting federation and returned archery to the Olympics?” I have added it as a possible alternate above but am happy to play with it. QPQ: N - Not done Overall: I apologise if I seem to have been very harsh and I could be being very finicky, but the article is very clunky to read, with short little sentences and paragraphs that I feel don’t flow very well. Further, there is no such thing as the “British Air Force”, it is the United Kingdom’s air force or the Royal Air Force. Earwig shows 13.8% match to the Plannthin webpage, but I don’t think it breaches the COPYVIO threshold. Also QPQ is required. Cavalryman (talk) 04:08, 3 September 2021 (UTC). Hello @SportsOlympic: this nomination has been sitting here for almost a week and I can see you have not edited the article, nor have you supplied a QPQ. Are you still interested in pursuing the nomination? Cavalryman (talk) 12:56, 9 September 2021 (UTC). Olympedia are the same people as Sports Reference and is states at WP:Sports as reliable. It’s a pitty you can’t open the second source, is has great and reliable content. So the main issue is that it stated that she was Captain and the naming of the British Air Force? I’m not native English, so I can’t write it in high class English. As that is a problem, I can’t improve it to your satisfactions. I will rename the Air Force name and title of Captain because that might me wrong. Next to that, I don’t like your other option: it not mentioned she had a high rank and she was the first female at an sports federation SportsOlympic (talk) 20:24, 9 September 2021 (UTC) I can find no such reference at WP:Sports but perhaps I am missing something, there has only been one discussion at the reliable source noticeboard WP:Reliable sources/Noticeboard/Archive 335#Olympedia, that being said it is not used to cite anything controversial. Whilst you have made a couple of small fixes, you missed some of the nuance in my comments above particularly those points listed in green. Further, the claim in the hook to be high ranked depends upon if the rank of Captain (which is clearly wrong) is supposed to be an Army or a Navy Captain, a Captain in the Army is not high ranked, Navy is getting up there. As it stands I feel this article is not at the standard required to be featured on the main page, but I am happy for others to take a look at it. Cavalryman (talk) 22:38, 9 September 2021 (UTC). I have not looked at the article but would like to confirm that Olympedia is an authoritative source for Olympic bios. Schwede66 18:15, 13 September 2021 (UTC) Schwede66, many thanks, honestly Olympedia is the least of the issues here. Kind regards, Cavalryman (talk) 22:39, 13 September 2021 (UTC). It has been over a week and the nominator has made very little effort to rectify many of the issues raised above, nor have they supplied a QPQ (I was considering donating a QPQ if issues were rectified). They have received a TP notification [1] and been pinged above, so unfortunately I think this should be marked as ineligible and closed. Cavalryman (talk) 00:44, 17 September 2021 (UTC). Hi Cavalryman, I've done considerable cleanup work on the article, finding published sources for a good bit of the material, and rewriting some parts based on the additions. This one should get a whole new review. Mary Mark Ockerbloom (talk) 06:40, 17 September 2021 (UTC) It might need a new hook too: ALT4:... that after serving as a meteorological officer in the Second World War, Inger K. Frith brought archery back to the Summer Olympic Games? Barker, Philip. "Inger Frith blazed a trail for women in sports governance". — Preceding unsigned comment added by Mary Mark Ockerbloom (talk • contribs) 06:46, 17 September 2021 (UTC) @Mary Mark Ockerbloom: you sure have done some work on it, I will endeavour to provide a second review soon.

Inger Kristine Frith (nee Pragholm) is recorded as being born on 23 January 1909, and having served (W/265733) in the South African Air Force (SAAF) from 23 October 1941 to 21 July 1945 as a meteorologist/forecaster. Extremely awkward, and leading with Captain gives the impression that she was subsequently demoted to Second Lieutenant in the following paragraph. - reworded She and her husband eventually settled in Crowthorne. Sticks out like a sore thumb, maybe move it into the later life section, as in "died in Crowthorne where she and Ronald had established their home."REMOVED In 1985, she was credited as "the main architect of archery's reintroduction to the Olympic programme in 1972." This quote needs in-text attribution. DONE It's getting closer, with some of the issues raised in the first review have still not been resolved, and care needs to taken to ensure the correct source is used to cite certain pieces of information. I have struck ALT0 because we have now clarified that she was not "a high ranked pilot during World War II". Cavalryman (talk) 04:03, 20 September 2021 (UTC). I have also struck my first ALT1 as she did not serve in the RAF but instead served in the SAAF, so have added ALT2, with no preference between it and ALT4. Cavalryman (talk) 00:48, 21 September 2021 (UTC). ALT numbers amended to reflect added ALT3 above. Cavalryman (talk) 21:46, 5 October 2021 (UTC). Unfortunately, Cavalryman, there were two hooks labeled ALT3. I renamed the second one "ALT4", but you should specify whether you were referring to the first ALT3 or the one now called ALT4. MANdARAX • XA?Ab?AM 21:08, 5 October 2021 (UTC) @Mandarax: yes I can see the second ALT3 was added here, I have amended my comment accordingly. Kind regards, Cavalryman (talk) 21:46, 5 October 2021 (UTC). I have copy-edited the article. She served in both the Women's RAF and the SAAF, but I am not sure that the article needs to be held up over debates about her wartime service. I have proposed an alternative that just focuses on her role in sports. The article is worth including in DYK, so I am happy to step in a help get it finished. The sources seem credible to me. Are there other issues left? PMCH2 (talk) 22:46, 26 September 2021 (UTC) Respectfully, not all of the issues raised in the above review have been addressed. Further, then sent to Cairo where she transferred from the SAAF to Great Britain's Women's Royal Air Force, receiving a commission contradicts the preceding paragraph that says she served ... in the South African Air Force (SAAF) from 23 October 1941 to 21 July 1945 and the fact that to have been a Second Lieutenant she must already have been a commissioned officer. Cavalryman (talk) 12:49, 27 September 2021 (UTC). I have added archive links for sources that don't have authors. I removed the one link that didn't work. Others have appropriate details. I have replied above to the concerns I have addressed. I removed the phrase about the commission. I have done my best to address all the issues. PMCH2 (talk) 03:26, 3 October 2021 (UTC) @PMCH2: when I get a chance I will have another detailed look. At a cursory glance, there is still plenty of room to add more bibliographic information to the citations, for instance the www.danishww2pilots.dk source should be: Plannthin, Mikkel (12 September 2010). "Inger Kristine Frith (née Pragholm)". Danish WW2 Pilots. Archived from the original on 31 August 2021. Retrieved 29 August 2021. I will look at the rest soon. Also, a QPQ still has not been provided. Cavalryman (talk) 21:59, 5 October 2021 (UTC). I haven't seen a DYK be scrutinized this closely before in regards to citations. I stepped in to try to help, but it's not my article, and I have spent as much time as I can. You seem to have a very high bar. I don't have a DYK credit to donate. 22:57, 7 October 2021 (UTC) I am sorry you think I am being overly harsh, but I think it is plain sloppy not including proper attribution, and the with the example above I think the fact that the same author is responsible for two cited sources is relevant. I initially reviewed the article because I thought the subject was interesting and worthy of some time in the main page sun. But I too have found it frustrating, I have conducted two complete reviews and even then my findings have not been acted upon, and further still there has been a stunningly consistent lack of attention to detail. I will now do some editing of the article to bring it up to a standard I believe is required. Cavalryman (talk) 01:28, 8 October 2021 (UTC). Thanks for your edits on the article. It reads better and I can see you have cleaned up the sources. I will do a QPQ this weekend, so we can get this over the line.PMCH2 (talk) 12:41, 10 October 2021 (UTC) Many thanks. If you cannot I will try to do one. I also intend to email World Archery to see if we can get a photo. Regards, Cavalryman (talk) 13:13, 10 October 2021 (UTC). I have reviewed Kennin Rebellion for DYK. Thanks for chasing down a photo - that would be great.PMCH2 (talk) 14:03, 12 October 2021 (UTC) Many thanks. Re photo I have been had correspondence with World Archery and they have said we can use the 1961 photo in this article, I am just trying to get them to confirm what license they are happy to release it under. Given I am now responsible for over 70% of the text [2], should a fresh reviewer have a look at this? Cavalryman (talk) 22:10, 12 October 2021 (UTC). After some initial positive correspondence World Archery not responded about licenses for almost a week. I will send one more email but am not holding my breath that a photo will be released. Cavalryman (talk) 22:29, 17 October 2021 (UTC). yeah, I think we're going to need a new reviewer on this one. Cavalryman, given your contributions to getting this article to DYK, I've added you to the credits section. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 20:04, 18 October 2021 (UTC) As best I can tell, the major issues concerning sourcing and attribution have been addressed, and this article seems ready for the main page. Thanks to everyone who contributed to make this work. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 04:54, 20 October 2021 (UTC) @Theleekycauldron: if a photo is released I will ping you to see if you are happy for it to be added to the nomination. Kind regards, Cavalryman (talk) 05:09, 20 October 2021 (UTC). Re photo ... the person I have been corresponding with at World Archery needs to return to the office to confirm their ownership status of this picture, due to covid that cannot occur before 4th November. I request this be held off until then. Cavalryman (talk) 09:50, 20 October 2021 (UTC). @Cavalryman: happy to wait. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 20:23, 21 October 2021 (UTC) Any updates on the image? If we waiting just for the image, I'll suggest to let this nomination run without an image. – Kavyansh.Singh (talk) 08:03, 30 October 2021 (UTC) As said above I do not expect any word before the 4th of November. If there is a chronic shortage of articles for DYK then by all means run this, but it would be a shame to potentially deny this most capable woman a face when she is featured for the sake of a week. Cavalryman (talk) 10:08, 31 October 2021 (UTC). There is no shortage of hooks on DYK. I was just concerned about how backlogged this particular nomination is. If it is worth waiting for the image, no issues then. – Kavyansh.Singh (talk) 10:19, 31 October 2021 (UTC) I have just received this in an email from World Archery: I checked last Thursday in our old history books, but there is no mention of photographer there. However, I'm on another track that was given to me by the author of another book on the history of our federation, but I'll have to check it out this Thursday when I'm again in the office. Things are in progress, and I should be able to give you some good news by next week! If everyone is happy to wait a few more days hopefully we’ll have a photo. Cavalryman (talk) 08:07, 8 November 2021 (UTC). @Cavalryman: Any updates? I think this should get promoted within a week if an image doesn't materialize. Side note to @BlueMoonset: original nom has been blocked for socking, do they still get a credit? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 05:13, 17 November 2021 (UTC) theleekycauldron, I'm trying to remember. Why don't you ask at WT:DYK and see whether there are any recollections about past cases, or strong opinions either way. Sorry I can't be more definitive. On the matter of promoting, the nomination will be three months old on December 2, and should have been promoted prior to then. BlueMoonset (talk) 05:30, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I see Wikipedia talk:Did you know/Archive 152#Multiple DYK nominations in process by newly checkuser-blocked sockpuppet: how to proceed?, which ended up with every nom made by the sock being rejected. Since this one's been adopted, We shouldn't close this nom, it's been adopted, but I am striking their credit. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 05:46, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Apologies, I was going to give an update this morning (Australian time). I had an email overnight from World Archery wanting to clarify the process of uploading a picture, I wouldn’t mind betting there will be an email with photo attached in the inbox at permissions@wikimedia.org tomorrow Swiss time. I agree, if there is no image within a week promote it, this has been a lengthy process. Cavalryman (talk) 06:03, 17 November 2021 (UTC).

Self-nominated at 08:59, 29 September 2021 (UTC). The article needs copyediting first. In addition, the table in the article is mostly empty. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 11:42, 12 October 2021 (UTC) Thanks for your suggestion. Table moved to sandbox for further expansion. Cerevisae (talk) 13:35, 17 October 2021 (UTC) @Narutolovehinata5: I have carried out some copyedits, let me know if there are areas that need another run-through. CMD (talk) 07:59, 24 October 2021 (UTC) Apologies for the late reply! Anyway, ALT0 is probably the best hook among the three proposed (ALT1 seems unimpressive to me while ALT2 may need additional context). However, the sentence verifying ALT0 doesn't have a footnote; instead, the references for it are spread across other nearby sentences instead, duplication is needed here for DYK purposes. In addition, it may be a good idea to propose an additional hook about Sarawak being the biggest timber exporter in the 1980s since that fact seems more interesting than the others discussed here. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 06:53, 1 November 2021 (UTC) added ALT 3. Cerevisae (talk) 04:30, 5 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you for the proposal; however, I feel that it may not meet WP:EGG. Would it be possible to rewrite ALT3 to make the link to "Economy of Sarawak" clearer? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 06:52, 5 November 2021 (UTC) talk, ALT 3 changed. Cerevisae (talk) 14:23, 8 November 2021 (UTC) ALT3 reads better, but it may still need to be copyedited for grammar. In addition it lacks a bold link to the DYK article subject. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:29, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Hook copyedited. CMD (talk) 07:03, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you for the edits. Now the article was new enough and long enough at the time of the nomination and no close paraphrasing was found. However, there are still a number of outstanding issues. Firstly, the sentence that mentions the main hook fact is lacking a footnote, with the relevant reference instead coming at the end of the paragraph where the fact is located at; duplication is necessary here per DYK rules. Secondly, the article doesn't say that the timber industry contributed "greatly" to Sarawak's economy: I would suggest deleting the word "greatly" from the hook, with the rest of that part being accepted as it's implied by the rest of the article. Thirdly, a QPQ has yet to be provided; this was the nominator's sixth nomination, so a QPQ should have been provided at the time of the nomination or within a week of then.

However, in the article the statement “they considered German lands too poor for annexation” is sourced to p.204 of Wells. pp.206-7 referred to above is used to support that they that “it was too costly in economic and military resources” to go into in Germany. I guess either way the hook is sourced but could you clarify the exact sourcing of the hook. Interesting: Y QPQ: None required. Overall: Interesting thorough article, well-written with good quality sourcing. Earwig shows no issues. Just a minor query around the hook sourcing but otherwise will be good to go. DeCausa (talk) 08:23, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @DeCausa: I found the web link that (for me) shows a preview if you're able to see it: https://books.google.com/books?id=mc30CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA206&lpg=PA206 SpartaN (talk) 10:07, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @SpartaN: Thanks for providing the link. It’s prompted a couple of thoughts for me. Firstly, Wells doesn’t seem to be saying the reason for the withdrawal is definitively known (“… the reasons for these decisions must have lain…”) i.e he’s making an assumption, however well founded. The hook is more definite than Wells is. Secondly, Wells’ emphasis is on the strength of the resistance being behind the reason - the poor value of the territory makes it “not worth it” because of the strength of the resistance. That’s not quite the same as just saying the land wasn’t valuable. (I notice the text you used in the article on this reflects that effort/value ratio issue.) To fix both points would you be prepared to consider an ALT1 which after “…Teutoburg” continues something along the lines of “…likely decided to leave Germany because the military effort was out of proportion to the territory’s value?” although there may need to be some trimming to get it into the 200 character limit. DeCausa (talk) 11:12, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @SpartaN and DeCausa: It's been over a month since the last comments here, have there been any updates? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:31, 13 November 2021 (UTC) From my point of view I’m waiting for SpartaN’s reply to my last post here. But I notice they haven’t edited Wikipedia since then, over a month ago. So I’m not quite sure what can be done. DeCausa (talk) 08:17, 13 November 2021 (UTC) I see. Given that there's really only one issue holding the nomination back, would anyone be willing to adopt this in case SpartaN doesn't return? It would be a shame if the nomination failed at this point. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 06:35, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I’m not sure what exactly are the DYK rules on this but, subject to that, options could be (a) I propose an ALT1 hook and someone else signs it off; (b) someone else proposes an ALT1 hook and I sign it off; (c) if anyone disagrees with me on the original hook I’m happy to step away and they sign it off. DeCausa (talk) 11:04, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I've looked at the Wells source and concur that it is saying the withdrawal was more down to the ratio of effort required to potential reward, and have boldly tweaked the copy in the article to reflect this. For what it's worth, I think ALT1 works just fine. firefly ( t · c ) 11:16, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Ok. I’m just going to formalize the ALT1 and let someone else add the tick and sign off: ALT1:... that the Romans won a series of campaigns against the Germanic tribes after the disaster at Teutoburg but likely decided to leave Germany as the effort was out of proportion to the territory’s value? DeCausa (talk) 12:07, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Since the reviewer has proposed a new hook, another editor will be needed to sign this off. I'm not sure though if the section linking in the bold links is allowed, however. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:29, 15 November 2021 (UTC) sorry, I missed that. It’s not even necessary to link to a section of the article so I’ve taken it out of ALT1.

The hook seems fine, and maybe cited in the article. Can we have a source here? Rest, a QPQ has been done. Till the neutrality concerns are resolved, this DYK nomination should be on hold. – Kavyansh.Singh (talk) 06:57, 20 October 2021 (UTC) Kavyansh.Singh I rewrote the disputed section based on more reliable sources. Unfortunately, it was reverted immediately by ?Khirurg who appears to think that the New York Times is not a reliable source. Perhaps they would explain here why they object. (t · c) buidhe 03:05, 24 October 2021 (UTC) Yeah you rewrote it alright - by removing a whole bunch of sources. Maybe you can explain why AP is not reliable source? Perhaps you can also explain why you removed the POV tag, even though your edit did not address any of the issues raised in the talkpage? Khirurg (talk) 03:07, 24 October 2021 (UTC) Khirurg : Hi, I don't think the AP source supports the content it's cited for. The AP source reports that Greece has made certain accusations, it doesn't say whether they are correct or not. I'm not sure how Greek accusations against Turkey (regardless of whether they are correct or not) have any bearing about this article, which is about Greece. Cleanup tags should be removed unless there is active discussion ongoing and the person placing it can substantiate that there is a problem with the article. (t · c) buidhe 03:14, 24 October 2021 (UTC) Not only you removed AP news, you also removed the Brussels International Center. Your edits made the article even more POV, by trying to spin away the hostile actions of the Turkish government. And it's not a "cleanup tag", it's POV tag, and there is very much an active discussion going on, first of all right here. If you are avoiding the article talkpage and spin that "no discussion ongoing", that's not going to work. Khirurg (talk) 03:23, 24 October 2021 (UTC) Khirurg Actually I have no opinion on the reliability of BIC at this point, but I hesitate to cite think tanks when there are better sources available (I cited the New York Times, Verfassungsblog and an academic paper, all of which are higher quality than a think tank). I checked several sources and all of them mention that the main change in February-March 2020 was opening the border to migrants, some also mention that Turkey bussed migrants to the border or that at least one incident of coercing migrants was reported. Your wording suggests that all or many migrants since then were coerced to travel to Greece. This is misleading because few if any reliable sources support coercive "push" tactics being a widespread or systematic practice by Turkey at its border with Greece. (t · c) buidhe 04:02, 24 October 2021 (UTC) Not only is BIC itself a perfectly reliable source (much more so than the partisan NGOs you have filled the article with), but it's really not hard to find sources about the Turkish government coercing migrants to the border [3]. This assume of course that one in inclined to look for sources, instead of pretending they don't exist. And here [4] (and then doubled down [5], you seem to have followed me to a Requested Move I recently participated in, in what appears to be clear WP:HOUND behavior. So everyone can see what's going on here. Khirurg (talk) 00:47, 25 October 2021 (UTC) Okay, coming back to the DYK criteria, this seems to meet everything except the neutrality issues. I see that there has been no active discussion on the talk page form at-least 17 days. @Buidhe Any updates on @Khirurg's concerns? I can' formally approve this until the neutrality concerns are resolved. – Kavyansh.Singh (talk) 16:28, 25 October 2021 (UTC) @Kavyansh.Singh, Buidhe, and Khirurg: this nomination should probably be closed if the neutrality concerns are not resolved one way or another. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 01:21, 10 November 2021 (UTC) Great, now you can filibuster DYKs you don't like by raising spurious "concerns" and inserting loaded language. (t · c) buidhe 01:34, 10 November 2021 (UTC) What "loaded language"? I raised my concerns in the talkpage, and you've done nothing but edit-war since then. Khirurg (talk) 01:54, 10 November 2021 (UTC) The most egregiously loaded language I recall was a human rights violation that encapsulates a will to eliminate a person’s presence on the face of the planet, which was added by you. Khirurg (talk) 02:02, 10 November 2021 (UTC) You insist on inserting loaded language like "Weaponization of migration" and "coercive engineered migration" which simply do not reflect the majority reliable sources (and are only tangentially related to the article topic, because they are accusations against Turkey rather than Greece) as explained above. I explained that you have misrepresented sources as seen above, and substituted opinion pieces for news coverage and peer-reviewed academic papers, and all you do is revert. So it's unclear to me how any progress can be made here. (t · c) buidhe 02:07, 10 November 2021 (UTC) Everything I have added is sourced to reliable sources. As far as opinion pieces, you're the one that has added those, such as this opinion piece written by grad students [6]. You haven't made the slightest effort to meet me halfway, instead you just blanket-revert all my additions claiming "my sources are better than yours". No attempt at dispute resolution, just blanket reverts like this [7]. The article is mainly based on activist NGO sources. Yes, there can be no progress under these conditions. Khirurg (talk) 02:45, 10 November 2021 (UTC) You literally replaced a news article from the New York Times and academic paper with an opinion piece from The Hill regarding the March 2020 escalation in order to replace fact-based description with loaded language of "weaponization". I did not cite any opinion pieces in the article, and it's a lie to say that the article is "mainly based on activist NGO sources". (t · c) buidhe 03:37, 10 November 2021 (UTC) (Personal attack removed). I just linked to an opinion piece you put in the article in my previous post. InfoMigrants, Mare Liberum, Aegean Boat Report are all activist NGOs used as references (to name just a few). The only way to resolve this is through some form of third party mediation. Would you be agreeable to something like that, yes or no? Khirurg (talk) 04:01, 10 November 2021 (UTC) That's simply untrue, InfoMigrants is a journalism outfit based on a media partnership, not a NGO let alone an "activist" one, and the EJIL Talk piece is expert analysis, not from their editorial section. As for third party mediation, sure why not? But I can't see the use in repeating points that were ignored the first time. (t · c) buidhe 12:11, 10 November 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: imho, the best way to break a filibuster is the old fashioned way: cloture motion. I'd recommend that you get as many eyes on this as possible, see if a clearer consensus falls out. my confidence in either of you conceding your point is dwindling, so this back-and-forth seems unhelpful, as you both pointed out. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 08:52, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Articles created/expanded on October 9[edit] Pankratius Pfeiffer ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that Salvatorian priest Pankratius Pfeiffer saved hundreds of Jews in Rome during the Second World War? Reviewed: 1936 Northeast Flood Created by Ergo Sum (talk). Self-nominated at 17:52, 9 October 2021 (UTC). New article that was created on 9 October 2021? is 3,212 characters and nominated on the same day. No copyvios detected and duplication detector of [8][9][10][11][12] reveal no close paraphrasing issues (AGF PDF docs which can't go through Dup detector). Article is well-sourced. Hook is 103 characters long (under 200 character max.) and is interesting. Refs 4 and 5 (verifying the hook) are reliable sources. QPQ done. Looks good to go! —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:41, 9 October 2021 (UTC) Too many red flags here. If he really saved hundreds of Jews, you would expect plenty of confirmation of this in scholarly sources and him to be recognized by Yad Vashem. I can't count the number of times that I've seen mainstream newspapers print completely false stories about Jews being rescued during the holocaust, so better sources are definitely needed to confirm these extraordinary claims. Thanks Brigade Piron for letting me know about this. (t · c) buidhe 16:51, 10 October 2021 (UTC) I have to admit I'm just a bit perplexed by the argument. Except in fairly uncommon cases of multiple RS that contradict each other, we don't generally recognize any "hierarchy" of reliable sources. Sources are either RS or they are not. So I'm not sure what kind of sources you have in mind as "better" sources. The ones currently cited in the article are all RS, so that should be the end of it. I might add that if you seek some manner of official imprimatur in the vein of Yad Vashem, the City of Rome named a street after him. Your point about why there isn't more extensive coverage of this historical figure is well taken but can easily be attributed to the fact that all manner of historical figures are lost to history, especially those who are notable really for one major event in their life that did not come to light until years later, as is the case here. Indeed, one of the RS in this article describes Pfeiffer as being "lost to history." I'm adding the new review icon here so that we can get at least one more editor's evaluation of this. Ergo Sum 13:32, 16 October 2021 (UTC) There are very few people who actually saved hundreds of Jews during the Holocaust and plenty of hoaxes that were reported as truth by various news organizations—for example Necdet Kent. In other cases, actual rescue did occur but the numbers are greatly exaggerated and repeated uncritically by news organizations, such as Raoul Wallenberg. If the story is true you would expect to see it covered in many more credible sources. There are plenty of cases where a source is reliable for some info but not others. For example, someone's CV is often reliable for "they worked at X organization" but not "they are a world expert in Z". Extraordinary claims require extraordinary sourcing. (t · c) buidhe 21:27, 16 October 2021 (UTC) I should say that I share Buidhe's concerns. I think saying that "all manner of historical figures are lost to history" rather side-steps the sheer volume of historical scholarship on all aspects of the Holocaust. On a more banal note, I think part of the problem is that the sources cited are, essentially, all journalistic sources published by explicitly Catholic or Salvatorian outlets. The specific sources cited for the "saved" claim are Romereports (I am not familiar with this outlet, but the typo in the video does not inspire confidence) and a self-published Salvatorian newsletter. Neither are scholarly sources and both are, again, explicitly confessional in nature. I think WP:BIASED may on point in a highly sensitive issue touching on the wider disputes about Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust. Do we know what the Samerski book says, for example? —Brigade Piron (talk) 08:55, 17 October 2021 (UTC) Buidhe It is true that the sources cover Catholic issues, but only the Salvatorian one is actually published by a Catholic institution. I need not go into how varied Catholic newspapers are in their adherence/faithfulness to the Catholic hierarchy and beliefs (see e.g. National Catholic Reporter versus National Catholic Register). But more direclty, there actually are many scholarly RS that discussion Pfeiffer and his works in Nazi-occupied Rome. You will find them on the other language versions of this article. The problem is that I do not read Italian or German well enough to use them in the article. Coverage is not the issue. It is English language coverage. Ergo Sum 13:48, 17 October 2021 (UTC) @Ergo Sum: perhaps add the word "reportedly" before "saved". I'm inclined to accept in good faith the sources used as reliable – none of them have not been deprecated nor deemed generally unreliable. —Bloom6132 (talk) 16:41, 26 October 2021 (UTC) DYK should not cover unconfirmed reports or rumors so I strongly disagree with that suggestion. As well as assuming sources are reliable if they've never been discussed at WP:RSN, which disregards important parts of WP:RS such as WP:CONTEXTMATTERS. There is no issue with citing sources in Italian or German, but if it's not confirmed that they support the content then it's incorrect to assume that they do. (t · c) buidhe 20:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Bloom6132: I tend to think that statements are either supported by RS and written in wikivoice or they're not accepted at all. For that reason, I shy away from words like "reportedly." I reiterate though that I think it's quite clear there's nothing wrong with the sources currently used. They're all RS, so that should be the end of it. Hence, why I think your initial review was satisfactory. Ergo Sum 23:40, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Ergo Sum: agreed. I'm still of the view that the hook satisfies criteria 3b. Criteria 4 states that "Nominations should be rejected if an inspection reveals that they are not based on reliable sources". That is not the case here. —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) You're still ignoring the principle in RS that context matters, and some sources are reliable for some but not other info. The two of us who actually write on Holocaust related topics have expressed that the sources cited are not reliable for the exceptional claims being made. (t · c) buidhe 23:59, 26 October 2021 (UTC) With all due respect, I am of the opinion that the sources used are reliable for the info in the hook. The fact that you and Brigade Piron write on Holocaust-related topics is irrelevant – it does not confer a veto over hooks pertaining to that subject. By that logic, I should be able to veto baseball or heraldry hooks ... —Bloom6132 (talk) 01:10, 27 October 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: Three of my DYKs promoted (including Coat of arms of the Falkland Islands from August this year) have included the word "reportedly" in the hook, as well as numerous hooks from other editors. Disagree all you want – this is accepted practice at DYK. —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: I'm aware that you have experience writing about Holocaust-related articles and I put value in your assessment as a solid editor. However, I'm quite comfortable in my ability to vet RS, as well, and my confidence in these sources means I must disagree with your opinion here. Experienced editors do disagree at times, and it is my opinion that I think you have gotten this one wrong; doubtless, you think the same for me. I haven't seen any evidence that these are not RS. Therefore, I recommend if Bloom6132 is inclined to do so, to renew their approval of the hook. In the meantime, I'm going to request the input of additional experienced editors on the DYK talk page. Ergo Sum 01:28, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm going to ping @Bamse, Bermicourt, Jmabel, and Anyfile to see if we can find some reliable sources in other languages. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 01:46, 27 October 2021 (UTC) Oops, @AnyFile theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 01:47, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm currently traveling & very busy, so not much help here, I'm afraid. - Jmabel | Talk 01:53, 27 October 2021 (UTC) That said, more or less this same case is made in The Pope's Jews: The Vatican's Secret Plan to Save Jews from the Nazis by Gordon Thomas (not currently cited in the article). - Jmabel | Talk 02:00, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm unclear as to why the cited sources are unreliable: are we assuming that all information emanating from a Roman Catholic source is unreliable? If so what's the logic? In any case there are dozens of book sources in English, German, French and Italian that mention Pfeiffer, the problem is that few are accessible online. One is an entire biography of Pfeiffer "from baker to Vatican diplomat" which would be useful to track down: Willer, Philomena (2005). P. Pankratius Pfeiffer SDS: (1872-1945); vom Bäckergesellen zum Vatikandiplomat. Pub: Josef Fink. Others that mentions Pfeiffer and the Jews in Rome are: Liebhart (1996) Schwangau. Meding (1992), Flucht vor Nürnberg. Sinn (1976), Illegal. Bermicourt (talk) 08:41, 27 October 2021 (UTC) My issue is with the unreliability of journalistic works and popular history, which have in many cases published inaccurate information about rescues of Jews during the Holocaust. If better sources exist, they should be cited instead. An additional question is, do these sources actually support the claim of "hundreds" of Jews rescued by Pfeiffer personally? (t · c) buidhe 08:51, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I've now found sources that cover most of the article. Here are more: Liebhart (1996) Schwangau. Meding (1992), Flucht vor Nürnberg. Sinn (1976), Illegal. Prince Constantine of Bavaria (1952) Der Papst. Layer (1985), Schwäbisches Ehrenbuch - Pfeiffer credited with "saving Rome and other Italian cities including Chieti, Ascoli and Ovieto from destruction and other calamities" _ (1999). Publik-Forum - Pfeiffer the only German to have a street named after him in Rome and who fought to save Roman Jews. _ (1960). Bayerische Frömmigkeit - Pfeiffer described as the "Saviour of Rome and other cities in Italy" Robert Katz has written a number of books - Death in Rome (1967), Black Sabbath (1969), The Battle for Rome (2010) - which all mention Pfeiffer. Bottum and Dalin (2004). The Pius War has this interesting piece: "7. Pancrazio [sic] Pfeiffer. According to Carroll-Abbing, one of the men used by Pius XII to protest the Nazi roundup of Rome's Jews and intervene for persecuted victims was Father Pancrazio Pfeiffer, superior general of the Salvatorian Fathers, who also served as Pius XII' personal liaison to the German military command in Rome. Because Pfeiffer died tragically in an automobile accident toward the end of the war and thus never took part in the postwar analysis of Pius XII's conduct, many historians have overlooked him. But those who knew him or have researched his life have chronicled his collaborative efforts with Pius XII to rescue Jews and others during the war. See the article "Pfeiffer's List" by Robert Graham, 30 Days, June 1994, pp. 42-46. Prince Constantine of Bavaria's book on Pius XII, The Pope (London: Allan Wingate, 1954) [listed above] contains an excellent section on Pfeiffer, whom he describes as an agent for the pope on behalf of the victims of persecution and the fugitives in hiding" (p. 213). At Pfeiffer's death in May 1945, Vatican Radio paid tribute: "He came into contact with the Commander of the German occupying forces [in Rome in 1943-44]. From that day onwards, he placed his religious and spiritual qualities at the service of many who had been arrested or already condemned to death. He helped countless people in this way, and saved their lives, among them many Jews and other Italian personages. He championed..." In short there seems to be book evidence for virtually everything stated in the article apart from the specific details of the two incidents where 249 or 400 Jews were rescued. Based on my initial searches my expectation is that those incidents are likely to be recorded in the literature - we just need to be able to access more of the sources. Meanwhile there is no harm in pausing to use some of the above sources, plus those I've added to the Further reading section of the article in order to reinforce the existing references and then review where we are.

For example, Salvatorians USA Province is not independent of the article subject and therefore is not reliable for self-serving assertions such as "he saved many Jews in Rome from persecution and ultimately death" or "Every day, Pfeiffer visited the Regina Coeli prison and another prison on Via Tasso, where he would often return with freed prisoners who had been sentenced to death." (t · c) buidhe 08:27, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: would you still object if the article instead relied on the sources found by Bermicourt? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 04:58, 5 November 2021 (UTC) Depends, the Samerski source looks reliable to me but the book published by "Österreichische Provinz der Salvatorianer" has the same issue of close connection to the article subject. (t · c) buidhe 06:27, 5 November 2021 (UTC) All right. @Ergo Sum: I'm not going to promote the nomination without consensus to move forward, so if you want to try and rework the article's sourcing to approval, that can work.

This slipped my mind completely this weekend. I will deal with this tonight. Ergo Sum 15:45, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I have added several inline citations to the article, which refer to sources that were (very helpfully) added by Bermicourt. These sources support several of the very specific claims in the article, as well as the general thrust of the article which is in dispute here, namely that Pfeiffer was a liaison and in that capacity saved many Jews and others from the Nazis. In light of these reliable sources supporting the general claims, I think any concern about the pre-existing ones describing some of his more specific actions is ameliorated. There is a trove of additional sources in the Further Reading section that additionally describe in much greater detail Pfeiffer's actions but they are either in a foreign language which I do not adequately read to make use of as citations or are offline. All being said, I think there is now ample sourcing to back up the article's claims. Ergo Sum 05:49, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks, Ergo Sum—@Buidhe:, if this sourcing is up to your standards, we can move ahead. If not, we're probably going back to WT:DYK and asking for more eyes. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 05:52, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Hi, I've flagged the specific content in the article that supports the hook as needing a better source. There are other active cleanup tags on the article as well. However, I think there's sufficient sourcing for a modified version of the hook without the words "hundreds of". (t · c) buidhe 06:06, 17 November 2021 (UTC) We could cite "countless" using the ref above instead of "hundreds of". Bermicourt (talk) 08:33, 17 November 2021 (UTC) According to the source it's what Vatican Radio said about him after his death. DYK is not for eulogies imo. (t · c) buidhe 08:37, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I'm not following—is the source unreliable because it's after his death? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 08:40, 17 November 2021 (UTC) No, it's because it's Catholic presumably... We could always add "according to Vatican Radio..." But better still, we just need to cite the exact text from one of the many non-Catholic book sources and the problem will be solved. Bermicourt (talk) 08:46, 17 November 2021 (UTC) And yet another source: O'Reilly (2001) in Forgotten Battles: Italy's War of Liberation 1943-45 states that "the Vatican was able to assist many of Rome's Jews and others sought by the Germans through Father Pancrazio Pfeiffer's intervention with the Germans... His work was recounted by Robert Graham who has written extensively on the Vatican's role in World War II." Bermicourt (talk) 09:01, 17 November 2021 (UTC) And another: Bartley (2016) in Catholics Confronting Hitler states that "Father Pancrace [sic] Pfeiffer, a German priest and the superior general of the Salvatorian Order, was the pope's liaison with the German military. Several hundred hostages, including some under sentence of death, owed their release to the efficacious intervention of Father Pfeiffer." I don't know why I'm doing this - you can look up the references yourselves instead of opining and speculating from the sidelines in the classic Wikipedia way. :) Bermicourt (talk) 09:08, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @Bermicourt: Since it seems you have access to several sources that I do not (probably just requires further digging), would you want to add them as inline citations with page numbers, especially to support the proposition regarding hundreds of people saved?

BlueMoonset (talk) 04:23, 5 November 2021 (UTC) As far as I can tell the article meets DYK requirements, and a QPQ has been done. Earwigs finds a close match with Coda Media, but that's only because it was the source for quotes in the article, and all of them are properly referenced. I find the first hook hard to believe given China's international standing, and in any case as brought up by Bowlhover may be inaccurate anyway. As for the second hook, as I mentioned before it's ineligible as it's exactly 200 characters long, and per WP:DYK hooks that are at or shorter than 200 characters may be rejected per reviewer's discretion. Both ALT0 and ALT1 have struck: I am repeating my earlier suggestion that ALT1 instead be split into two separate hooks. As this is a China-related article and there appear to be some political discussion in the article, I'd also like to ask for a second opinion from someone more knowledgeable about China-related articles if the article doesn't fall afoul of relevant guidelines. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 13:12, 6 November 2021 (UTC) From Wikipedia:Did you know#The hook: The hook should be concise: no more than about 200 characters (including spaces and the question mark, but not including the ..., the space immediately following the ..., or any (pictured)). While 200 is a hard limit, hooks near or at this limit may still be rejected at the discretion of reviewers and administrators. This tool can be used for counting words. The guideline says that "200 is a hard limit", so it is not true that the 200-character ALT1 hook is "ineligible" or "simply too long". No reason has been given for rejecting a 200-character hook "at the discretion of reviewers". Here are two additional hooks based on the suggestion: ALT2: ... that Dianxi Xiaoge, who grew up in a remote Yunnan mountain without running water, is an Internet celebrity with roughly 16 million subscribers on all her platforms? ALT3: ... Dianxi Xiaoge went viral in China and internationally after making hamburgers for her grandparents who had never eaten them before? Cunard (talk) 07:48, 7 November 2021 (UTC) Well for one thing, the original was very difficult to read and seemed to combine too many facts into one hook. Usually DYK prefers simpler hooks whenever possible. In any case, I think ALT3 is the best hook here and the nomination is otherwise good to go, I'd just like to hear a second opinion from another editor on the article tone given that I'm a bit uncomfortable doing a solo review here given the "Commentary" section delves into some political matters. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:36, 7 November 2021 (UTC) On second thought, I have some concerns regarding the length of the article.

Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 11:10, 7 November 2021 (UTC) That the article is "rather detailed for an internet celebrity's page" should not be a concern.

Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:57, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I don't think we need Gatoclass to restate themself. Here's what they said at WT:DYK: The article doesn't use the phrase "one of only three Chinese influencers to gain international influence", so I'm not sure where you got that, but it does say she is one of only three "Chinese Internet celebrities who have reached international prominence", and the problem with that claim is that it's sourced to an article that is two years old and therefore not up-to-date. With regard to the overall length, I would agree that it is overly detailed and could use a trim. I'm not sure this is relevant to DYK however, as "overly detailed" is not one of our criteria. What I would say is that the level of detail does raise the chances of close paraphrasing so the article would need to be carefully checked for that. Anybody else with an opinion on this article?

Surely she's done some exciting things that can be turned into a hook? Drmies (talk) 18:08, 2 November 2021 (UTC) @Thriley and Drmies: Would this work as an alt? ALT1 ... that when she was called to appear in her first film, Milena Smit was working as a hotel receptionist? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:06, 4 November 2021 (UTC) User:Narutolovehinata5, that's the kind of thing I was thinking of, yes. Drmies (talk) 14:07, 4 November 2021 (UTC) If an active version is preferred, ALT1 could also be rewritten as ALT1a ... that Milena Smit was working as a hotel receptionist when she was called to appear in her first film? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 14:10, 4 November 2021 (UTC) I would prefer it to be something a bit more related to her film work. Currently thinking of another alt. Thriley (talk) 18:32, 5 November 2021 (UTC) @Thriley: anything? If not, I suggest moving forward with ALT1a. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 01:24, 10 November 2021 (UTC) @Theleekycauldron:, what about “in the film Parallel Mothers Penélope Cruz teaches Milena Smit how to make a potato omelet?” Thriley (talk) 03:03, 11 November 2021 (UTC) I don't think that would be allowed under DYK guidelines, which require hooks about works of fiction (for example films) to have a real-world connection. Since that's technically a plot point I don't think it would meet the guideline. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:20, 11 November 2021 (UTC) @Thriley, Drmies, and Theleekycauldron: Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 06:36, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I mean, I ain't really involved in this, I'm just trying to get y'all talking—but yes, nlh5 is correct that the hook probably wouldn't fly under dyk guidelines. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 06:47, 14 November 2021 (UTC) @Theleekycauldron: Sorry! I think ALT1 is fine. Thriley (talk) 15:43, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Thriley, please see this. More copyedits are necessary. The next sentence has an erroneous comma. And the "first film" in the hook--isn't that actually her fifth or so? Do you mean "feature film" or some such thing? Thank you, Drmies (talk) 17:20, 14 November 2021 (UTC) What about this hook? ALT2 “That in the Pedro Almodóvar film Parallel Mothers, Milena Smit and Penélope Cruz play pregnant women who give birth on the same day?” Thriley (talk) 20:46, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @Theleekycauldron: Is this hook acceptable under the guidelines? Thriley (talk) 20:57, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @Thriley: I'll ping BlueMoonset here in case I'm wrong, but I'm going to say no, it isn't. My reasoning here is that if the hook were read as plaintext, without any bolding or linking, it would be read as pretty much only interesting as it concerns the plot. The hook should concern Smit's life; if it concerns her work as an actress, only stating her role and not anything about production doesn't make the hook out-of-universe. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 21:28, 17 November 2021 (UTC) theleekycauldron, I was taking a look at the ALT1 hook and its sources, and the second Biography sentence is basically copied from Esquire—the Google translate version, at any rate. That's a problem. Another problem is that the source doesn't actually say that she was working as a hotel receptionist when she got the call, just that it was "one of these jobs", referring back to the four in the previous sentence, none of which were hotel receptionist. The article also needs a bit of copyediting. I don't think that either of the plot-based hooks should be used, and as Drmies notes, "first film" is not accurate, since it's Cross the Line that's in the source, which appears to be her fifth film. We could only use "first feature film" if the previous four in her filmography were all short films (which would need to be clearly sourced). Perhaps an angle for the information in ALT1 would be to say she was working in whatever job it was when she was cast in Cross the Line, for which she was nominated as best new actress in the Goya Awards.

Whispyhistory (talk) 06:32, 13 November 2021 (UTC) I don't see that exact sequence of numbers in the source, although there are others that look a bit like an IP address. The trouble is, the nominator seems to be the source for it looking a bit like an IP address, which it does, but we can't use that unless the source makes a similar point, which it does not appear to do. Something like this might work (numbers might need to be changed as mentioned): ALT1 ... that a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone may be described as 88.5.3.2? Philafrenzy (talk) 10:16, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Regarding the image, it's a fun idea but I don't think we run images as quizzes and the image is simply a skeletal foot, and not closely enough related to the hook.

I don't see how the hook you're suggesting is hooky. What exactly is wrong with the hook proposed? It's in the article and it's supported by the sources cited. And the image is directly related to the hook. It engages the reader into a spotting game. Dr. Vogel (talk) 14:57, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Like everyone else, I rather like the IP-address hook. If we wikilinked IP address, it would be supported in the linked articles, and fulfill the requirement that anyone following the links will be able to verify the hook. I don't think we need sourcing that says that a specific sequence of numbers is an IP address, as we have sources giving the general format of an IP address, and creating an example would be a trivial calculation ("Are all four of these numbers separated by periods in the range 0-255?"): "IPv4 and IPv6 address formats". www.ibm.com. An IPv4 address has the following format: x . x . x . x where x is called an octet and must be a decimal value between 0 and 255. Octets are separated by periods. An IPv4 address must contain three periods and four octets. The following examples are valid IPv4 addresses: 1 . 2 . 3 . 4 01 . 102 . 103 . 104 This hook is better than any alternative I can think of, and I don't see anything likely to be problematic about it (it's certainly verifiable). I think we might be in agreement on that? So if some rule technically prohibits it, we might have a good case for applying the WP:Ignore all the rules policy. Broken finger is also currently DYK-eligible and I think it uses the same numbering scheme.[1] HLHJ (talk) 02:07, 14 November 2021 (UTC) [edit: add fulltext url] I don't necessarily agree with the reading of WP:DYKCRIT 3b ( Each fact in the hook must be supported in the article by at least one inline citation to a reliable source [...]) that says that the IP thing needs to be in the article (compare e.g. Template:Did you know nominations/Urine deflector, which similarly took some creative licence in how the proposed hooks were phrased beyond what was stated in either the article or the cited source), and I agree with HLHJ that WP:IAR would be applicable regardless. As for the hooks themselves, writing "a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone may be described as 88.5.3.2" is a much poorer way of writing the hook (less "hooky") than the converse, i.e. "88.5.3.2 may refer to a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone". TompaDompa (talk) 11:28, 14 November 2021 (UTC) This. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 17:01, 16 November 2021 (UTC) We can't use IP address because the nominator just thought it up "oh, that looks like an IP address". It's not in the source as the nominator admits and therefore is not verifiable. And so what if it does look like an IP address? What does that tell us about broken toes? I like clever or quirky hooks and have written many (if I may say so), but they have to be based on something in the sources otherwise it's things made up one day. Philafrenzy (talk) 10:19, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you for all your comments. This is not the place to ignore all rules. The proposed hook is not supported by the source given in the article. I am inclined to approve ALT1 but it needs checking, unless another hook is proposed. Whispyhistory (talk) 15:11, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Oh dear, this has become contentious. I think the contended question is whether it's acceptable to have verified information not found in the nominated article, but only in another article, linked in the hook. Not as hooky, but for illustration: ALT3 ... that the dot-decimal notation string "88.5.3.2" is not only an an IPv4 address, but also a fracture in the middle of the bone at the tip of the little toe? "IPv4 and IPv6 address formats". www.ibm.com., Hallux proximal phalanx fracture in adults: an overlooked diagnosis I don't think we're debating whether the IP-address-hook statement is verifiable. The statement that "88.5.3.2" (and any number in that format) is a valid IPv4 address is supported by the IP address article and the IPv4 article, and this format is the subject of the Dot-decimal notation article. No-one had bothered to cite those statements in those articles, but since they've been challenged here, I've now cited them. So "88.5.3.2 is both an IP address[1] and a code for a broken toebone[2]" is certainly verifiable, and is now verified on Wikipedia. Any DYK reader should have no trouble verifying that the hook is accurate. Alternatives that do not mention IP addressees are not as hooky, but don't contain more information about broken toes: ALT4 ... that "88.5.3.2" is a toe fracture in the middle of the bone at the tip of the little toe, while a "78.5.3.2" is the parallel broken finger?

I don't think the hostility was intended by anyone; I suspect that it's felt partly due to the ease of mininterpretation in a text-only medium and partly due to human cognitive biases.[2] I certainly did, and do, not intend it. I spent a day's editing trying to resolve the conflict by finding references specifically saying that the two things were in notation X and adding that text to the article, but unfortunately non-inductive descriptions of the notations seem to have been considered so needless that an Internet RFC attempting to formalize them died of disinterest. I did find a source that explicitly defines the IPv4 format, and one that explicitly says that 88.1.2.2 is a specific fracture, and I've cited the latter in the article, but I don't think this helps. It is probably a bit unreasonable to expect a reviewer to do more than apply rules as best they can, and Wikipedia talk:Did you know might indeed be a better forum for a more detailed discussion. I don't really want to take part in one, though (nothing to do with this discussion, prior reasons). I posted because I felt responsible for the conflict and thought I might be able to help. My impression is that I made it worse; my apologies to everyone I've offended. HLHJ (talk) 03:41, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Nobody is offended, but if I may say so I think you are still missing the point. IP addresses have nothing to do with broken toes even if that notation may have a similarity. That's why the sources don't make the comparison and why the IP-based hooks are no good. Any of the other hooks might be fine (I haven't checked the numbers) just without the bit about IP addresses. The whole thing reminds me of unusually shaped vegetables where you may see a carrot shaped like a foot, people who see faces in clouds, and even apophenia. My personal observation that one thing looks a bit like another is not the basis for a hook unless reliable sources make the point too. Philafrenzy (talk) 09:09, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Folks, we are wasting a wonderful hook. Really. IP addresses have nothing to do with broken toes even if that notation may have a similarity and that is the whole point of making good hooks. They are supposed to be short, punchy, catchy, and likely to draw the readers in to wanting to read the article – as long as they don't misstate the article content. And one of the best recipes to make a hook good is to make it sound counterintuitive With any other option but the original, we are bound to receive another hook frequented by maybe a few hundred visitors. I would propose something to the tune of in some contexts, 88.5.3.2 might not mean an IP address but a broken bone in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone? so that no one claims here that we somehow delegitimise the IP address but at the same time so that we preserve the core of the hook. As for the claims that because the hook is not cited in the IP part, it can't be there - please don't be that pedantic. In our today's world of informatics we may assume that people who visit Wikipedia more or less imagine what IP addresses are, and may more or less imagine how they look like (in the worst case they will visit the article for details). The other part is cited. I see no problem with the original. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 17:01, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Szmenderowiecki I admit that I'm not very familiar with the topic, and the above discussion was confusing, but is the "this isn't an IP address" claim actually in the source? Because if it's not, then no matter how good the hook proposal is, it can't be used in a hook since hook facts need to be based on a reference. Also, I'm pretty sure that assumptions don't count as sources. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:31, 17 November 2021 (UTC) What I was leading is that we don't need to cite that the sky is blue, or that we have five fingers; or that there exist IP addresses for that matter. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 11:08, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Given that these IP number hooks aren't working out so far, I wonder if some other hooks unrelated to that could be proposed here.

Nominated by Victuallers (talk) at 16:21, 6 November 2021 (UTC). Article is new enough. Two correct writers are credited. The article is fully referenced. No copyvio detected. There is a bit of biased POV pushing in Wikipedia voice: "most vulnerable to climate change". This will be something our subject is saying no doubt. And this idea is also reflected in the hook with "endangered". The hook content is referenced and confirmed by the Guardian, apart from the "endangered" bit, which opinion is attributed to Tina Stege. So I suggest that "endangered" is taken out of the hook, or it is reworded so it is clear she is saying that. Hook alt1 is unsuitable as it does not link the article and I cannot tell what it is trying to say in relation to the subject. I can confirm image is CC-BY-3.0 as derived from the video with CC-BY-3.0 license. However I would suggest that a different image is selected from the video, perhaps near the end where the microphone is not obscuring her chin. QPQ is done.

There is a factual error, as the article states she was interred in Keokuk, Illinois, but the source says she died in Chicago, Illinois and was interred in Keokuk, Iowa. I am assuming good faith for a few references I cannot access (for example, ref 15 - The National Humane Review), which for me gives a landing page for the document, instead of an inside view). Otherwise, everything is properly sourced and there are no copyvio or close paraphrasing concerns (Earwig cites 3 potential problems, but they are not an issue here.) QPQ not required. Regarding the hooks, ALT0 is incorrect as stated, as it reads as if the study was conducted in the early 1900s by Meigs Crowder, whereas she published it in 1917 based on studies from that period. It'll need minor alteration. ALT1 is fine and sourced. I would prefer to promote an amended ALT0. A minor quibble, though not an issue for DYK: please add page numbers for cited sources.

AleatoryPonderings (???) (!!!) 01:52, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @AleatoryPonderings: Yes, but note that this court case is the "leading case with respect to the issue of common employers", establishing a precedent in Canadian law. At the time the lawsuit was filed, this was not the case, and in fact the trial judge ruled against Alouche (see last paragraph of background section); it was only after the case was brought to the Court of Appeal for Ontario that the "common employer doctrine" was established, and it became entrenched when leave to appeal the decision at the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed. Mindmatrix 15:11, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Ah, so the idea behind the hook is that, since Downtown Eatery changed the law on common employers, before Downtown Eatery Best Beaver would not have been Alouche's employer? That makes more sense. AleatoryPonderings (???) (!!!) 15:20, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: I'm going to inspect this again... Mindmatrix 15:18, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @AleatoryPonderings: Alright, so to ensure everything is correct, the following timeline occurred: Alouche was hired to be manager at For Your Eyes Only (owned by Grad and Grosman), and began work on 29 December 1992 Alouche was sent a Notice of Discipline in May 1993, and was fired on 15 June 1993 In October 1993, Alouche filed action for wrongful dismissal against Best Beaver Management Inc., as that was the source of his paycheques Best Beaver ceased operations in mid-1996, and all assets distributed to other companies owned by Grad and Grosman The trial resolved in favour of Alouche Best Beaver did not pay out the judgement (all its assets had been redistributed) Sherriffs were dispatched to For Your Eyes Only, where they seized $1,855 Downtown Eatery filed claim against Alouche, stating the cash belonged to it Alouche defended, and counterclaimed against Grad, Grosman, and all companies they controlled on the grounds of common employer doctrine, the oppression remedy of the Ontario Business Corporations Act, and fraudulent conveyance the judge in the second trial (at Ontario Superior Court of Justice) ruled against Alouche the case was brought to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, where the previous ruling was overturned in 2001 in January 2002, an application for leave to appeal the decision at the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed So, the common employer doctrine was part of the second trial as a counterclaim to the suit filed by Downtown Eatery. I just wanted to ensure this satisfies your concerns. Mindmatrix 18:25, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks for this incredibly thorough response. My concern is maybe philosophical or definitional. If I say that company A employs person B, that has an ordinary meaning and a legal meaning. It is probably right that Best Beaver did not employ Alouche in the ordinary sense of "employ", because Best Beaver was a "paymaster" and not the name on the front of the building where he went to work. My reading of the case itself is that, before Downtown Eatery, it was at best indeterminate as a legal matter whether Best Beaver, alone or in combination with its affiliate companies, employed Alouche. After Downtown Eatery, it was established—as a matter of legal meaning, but not necessarily ordinary meaning—that Best Beaver was his employer, or part of his employer, or something like that. The reason I brought this up is that it's not clear how one could verify the claim that "Best Beaver was not Alouche's employer", because that claim might be true as a matter of ordinary meaning but the only authoritative legal ruling we have on this (namely, Downtown Eatery) holds that the claim is false. In any event, I'll leave this to the eventual reviewer to sort out. I find my brain twisting into knots. AleatoryPonderings (???)

Additionally, per MOS:FILMCAST uncredited roles need a source. the copyvio checker showed up a 50%+ similarity with a source, which may suggest over quotation. On top of that, the subject has unclear notability. I'm unsure which roles are significant and The House on Pine Street appears to have a questionable notability. None of her awards seem significant and I'm not seeing any significant coverage from reliable, independent sources.

Comment (not a review): this specific article, and its creation by proxy for a banned editor, is under discussion at Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard#Gerda Arendt proxying article creation for community-banned user LouisAlain, which has also raised questions about sourcing issues similar to the issues that caused the editor to be banned in the first place. I think the AN discussion needs to come to a conclusion before this can be considered for DYK, and also that any DYK review look very seriously at the sourcing issues (claims of unreliable self-published sources and of sources not verifying the claims they were used to source) discussed at the AN thread. Probably this is going to require that the reviewer be fluent in French. —David Eppstein (talk) 04:15, 8 November 2021 (UTC) I removed LouisAlain from the credits because of concerns, because of me taking full responsibility, and because he never cared about them anyway.

As for the article itself, the article meets DYK requirements, and close paraphrasing was not detected. A QPQ is still pending. My main issue is the hook; frankly, it does not appeal to a broad audience. Duruflé doesn't appear to be a well-known figure (indeed, this pageviews check shows that her English article has had less than 200 total pageviews over the past 30 days, while her French article has only been viewed 5 times during that same period), and given that the hook is dependent on the connection to her, it's just not working here. Looking at the article, unfortunately I couldn't see any information that would work as a broadly-interesting hook, so unless the article is expanded further and new interesting information is added to the article, I can't see this working out on DYK sadly.

Overall: Another good one from Gerda - thank you. Cathedral organists always knock me out, because the cathedral is the pipe organ's soundbox, so they are playing the building - every stone feels it. So this guy deserves an article. The initial question by David Eppstein has now been resolved. All that remains to complete this nom is the QPQ. Storye book (talk) 11:33, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I would not normally contest a review, and I accept that the above review by Narutolovehinata5 gets priority in the normal DYK process. However I don't agree that the number of online hits received by an organ teacher is a judge of their value or ability. If Mme Durufle's pupil Frédéric Blanc has achieved the position of titular organist at Notre Dame, then as I understand it he is the equivalent of a top film star in the movie business. A cathedral organist has great musical power in the building and in the city, and Notre Dame is one of the greatest cathedrals in the world - with good acoustics to boot. Many subjects covered at DYK appeal to a particular audience as opposed to a general one, and that aspect does not disqualify a DYK nomination. That is why DYK hooks cover such a variety of subjects - something for everyone, eh? I don't think the article is unacceptable unless "expanded further and new interesting information is added" - the article is solidly based, and tells us who the subject is, why he is notable, and what he has achieved. Storye book (talk) 11:33, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @Storye book: The issue here is that the Notre Dame mentioned in the hook is not the Notre Dame that most people know (i.e. the one that's currently being rebuilt), but a far less famous one that also happens to be in Paris. Had it been the case that he was the organist for the Notre Dame Cathedral (the famous one), I would have actually approved the hook. The issue here is that the Notre Dame mentioned here is a much more obscure one and not the internationally-famous one (note that Notre Dame is a fairly common name for Catholic churches around the world). As for the fame part, Duruflé's obscurity would have been a non-issue had it been the case that Blanc was the organist of the Notre Dame Cathedral and not the one mentioned in this hook, but given that he was actually the organist of a less well-known church, the hook's interestingness is now reliant on the Duruflé connection, and the connection there doesn't make for a broadly interesting hook in this case. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 11:50, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @Narutolovehinata5: OK, fair enough, I won't argue with that. In that case, what about a new hook about the U.S. masterclasses, in which a mention of some of the university venues should pick up some hits. Taken together, I think his achievements are still interesting and notable. I would very much like to hear his playing of Charles-Marie Widor in the Notre-Dame d'Auteuil - pity we can't put the sound of that in the hook. @Gerda Arendt: Storye book (talk) 12:11, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Honestly I have some reservations on if such hooks are truly interesting to a broad audience, but I'm open to such a hook if there's really nothing else that could be found about him. If such a hook is to be written, I would suggest focusing on Stanford University specifically since that one's probably the most famous among all the universities mentioned in the hook.

It is about 3200 bytes, satisfying length criterion. There are small issues with copied phrasing, such as "Elin Festøy was producing a documentary film about the children of lebensborn" which is nearly identical to that of A game about hatred, children and war. This could easily be fixed as "While producing ..." or "During production of...". In fact, the phrasing for the first three sentences in that section needs to be altered, as there is simply too much close paraphrasing. Otherwise, the text is fine and has sources, and all quotations are sourced. Hooks are suitably short and sourced. I do think there are better hooks to be had for this article though, perhaps one focusing on who the lebensborn were or what they experienced (and as it relates to the game, of course). QPQ completed. So, this needs a slight rephrasing for three sentences, and perhaps other ALT hooks to consider.

Freely licensed: Y Used in article: Y Clear at 100px: Y QPQ: Done. Overall: This is a nice article, which is new enough, long enough and well sourced. I am taking the offline sources in good faith. However, I have an issue with the hook which is not directly supported by the source. The source says that the two tribes hunt the bird for bushmeat and decorate their headgear and houses with its feathers and beaks. In another place it just says that "the gizzard of the hornbill was used in some local medicines for curing stomach disorders," but nowhere is this stated as a belief of those two tribes. So it needs to be amended to reflect the source. Alternatively there are some "fascinating facts" at the Oakland Zoo source that could be used, noting that they use a different English name, but the same Latin one. That name, Malayan wreathed hornbill, should perhaps be included in the lede. Also I wonder if the existing alternative name should just be bar-pouched hornbill as per the same website? Bermicourt (talk) 13:57, 11 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks for your feedback, Bermicourt! Re the gizzard : true is that it is not stated in any source that the local people believe .., but only that they use it for curing stomach problems. So I wonder whether the hook should / can be changed to either a) that they use it as medicine, or b) to a different hook altogether, e.g. something about the bird itself : that it flies up to some 25 km from its breeding site in search of favoured fruits, much farther than any other hornbill species. I didn't add this info yet, but can do if you think it worthwhile? Re the name "Malayan wreathed hornbill" : Blanford (1889) seems to have been the first and only one who used this name, but I haven't seen this in any other publication yet. – BhagyaMani (talk) 21:44, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks also to @Casliber: for DYK nominating this page!! – BhagyaMani (talk) 21:44, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, I think this article is worthy of a DYK, but you need to come up with one or two alternative hooks.

Source: 1 and 2 Comment: This is the first time I’ve ever made a DYK here, so here goes. I personally find this fact interesting because it highlights how the advent of YouTube, and internet fame in general, has allowed people to use their voice to reach people in positions of high influence, bringing hidden ideas to light and advocating for change. While this specific example falls under a video game/pop-culture category, and may not fit Wikipedia’s desire for academic material, I feel that this is interesting enough to share, as it’s one the gaming community can relate to, like with other social media trends such as #FreeSmash and "Rerelease Mother 3." As for the article itself, all of the citations should be reliable enough; they’re all from third-party/secondary source outlets and there isn’t any BLP violation to be found here. One concern I have is criteria #3 - “Each fact in the hook must be supported in the article by at least one inline citation to a reliable source, appearing no later than the end of the sentence(s) offering that fact. Citations at the end of the paragraph are not sufficient.” While the hook is sourced in the article, the refs are at the end of the section rather than per each sentence. I can fix that however. Anyway, I hope this fact does get accepted! If not, I understand, thanks for reviewing this anyway. Created/expanded by PantheonRadiance (talk). Self-nominated at 08:45, 17 November 2021 (UTC).

You'd need to have expanded the text content by 5x in length, which I am not seeing in the page history. You'll also need to resolve the many tags for additional citations and expansion in the article. Your best bet would be to get it to good article status and renominate then. See the DYK rules for more details. PS: I removed the image from this nomination, fair use (ie. copyrighted) images are permitted in articles only - Dumelow (talk) 14:35, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Ok that's fine if it can't be nominated and thanks for the suggestion. I'm also wondering what 5x or five fold means like how do I know if an article has been expanded 5 fold. Kaleeb18 (talk) 16:28, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Hi Kaleeb18, no worries and good luck with the article. The expansion is based on the number of characters (ie. letters, spaces etc.) in the article before you started work on it and the number after you've finished. You can use a script like Wikipedia:Did you know/DYKcheck but I just copy the article text into an online character counter (there's loads of websites if you do a Google search for "character counter" or similar) - Dumelow (talk) 16:40, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Oh ok, thanks again.

Article is new enough, very newsworthy event and hence well-sourced, no copyvios (Earwig reports a false positive on the Johnson quotation), QPQ done. However, without a source saying the taxi driver is comfortable to talk about his ear, I'm concerned the hook may not fit the spirit of "Consider very carefully whether the hook puts undue emphasis on a negative aspect of a living individual. Err on the side of caution, and when in doubt, suggest an ALT hook." Could we go with something else? Ritchie333 (talk) (cont) 18:41, 16 November 2021 (UTC) He's a scouser.

The point here is to get this lesser-known heroic guy the DYK, not focus on the scuzzball that started it, you know. I mean, something like Did you know that a bomb has just gone off outside a Liverpool hospital is so anodyne it defeats the object of DYK. People want to hear about this guy, not the perp or the police.

Hi Mike Peel, review follows: article created 16 November; article is well written and the main text is cited to what appear to be reliable sources for the subject; I didn't spot any issues with overly close paraphrasing from a sample of the sources; article exceeds minimum length; a QPQ has been carried out. I have a couple of outstanding queries: The following items from the infobox are not cited there or mentioned in the main text: That "Yuzhmash" was the contractor That it was launched from "Site 32/2" That the launch time was "4:55 UTC" That the manufacturer was "Yuzhnoye" That its intention was "Electronic and Signals Intelligence/ELINT" (mentioned also in the lead) The article and source support that 1,500 fragments were generated (as these are being tracked) but only "likely" that thousands of others were generated. As such I don't think this supports a hook stating plainly that it generated "thousands of pieces of debris". I think an alternative wording ("hundreds" or "at least 1,500") would be needed If you could let me know your thoughts - Dumelow (talk) 08:23, 16 November 2021 (UTC) "Hundreds" or "at least 1500" are both understating the impact, even "thousands" is too low. 1500 objects are large enough to track. Hundreds of thousands of smaller objects are expected, as reported by almost all sources. Somehow the Guardian misreported that as "hundreds". space.com, reuters, BBC, CNN, ... I think we can write hundreds of thousands. That's what the sources report, excluding the Guardian. --mfb (talk) 01:45, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @Dumelow: Thanks for the review, but it seems that this is now linked to in Wikipedia:In the news (wasn't expecting that), which I think makes it ineligible to also be a DYK.

Source: [38] Reviewed: Central Asian Orogenic Belt 5x expanded by Mccunicano (talk). Self-nominated at 00:06, 16 November 2021 (UTC). Newness requirement satisfied by 5x expansion on 11/15 from < 600 to > 3000 characters. Articles also long enough and compliant with core policies on citations and neutrality. The hook is in-line sourced. Photo has appropriate license. QPQ is done. There are, however, two problems: (1) There is some significant overlap with this source. To start, the following sentence is taken from the source without use of quotation marks and with no effort to paraphrase rather than use the precise words: "Local advocacy led to the establishment of Bridle Trails as a state park in 1932." Further, this sentence also strikes me as too closely drawn from the same source: "Initial park development dates to 1933 when Civil Works Administration employees and federal relief workers were employed in state parks as part of the New Deal program. Further work included burning logging debris, clearing brush and building trails and fences." Work needs to be done to put the material into your own words. (2) The hook strikes me as boring in that it states an obvious point. Horses having the right of way on this trail is not unique or special. On trails that are shared by humans and horses, it is the general rule that horses have the right of way. See here ("In general, horses always have the right of way, followed by hikers, then by bikers."). See also here ("For safety reasons, if you come across a horse and rider on any trail they always have right of way. Hikers and bike riders all yield to horses.") To include this on the main page, we really need something that is hooky or interesting about this trail.

For one, the quote is not actually "could have been made by aliens" so, considering this is all about misquotation, we should either use the actual quote or clarify that it is a misquotation. Then "as though it was a real announcement" implies that it was actually, I don't know, a fake announcement? A parody?

Further information: Official supplementary guidelines and unofficial guide  Warning: You are not logged in. Please create an account or log in to proceed. Alternatively, you may leave a message at the bottom of the DYK project talk page with the article you would like to nominate and the hook you would like to propose.  Warning: The helper script only works on desktop. Please switch to desktop view to continue. Install the DYK helper script by adding the line {{subst:lusc|User:SD0001/DYK-helper.js}} to your common.js page. Go back to the article, and choose the "DYK" option from the "More" menu (see image). Fill in the form and submit it. Check back periodically to address comments or concerns from the reviewer (it may take several weeks). Manual instructions[edit] Create a subpage for your new DYK suggestion and then list the page below under the date the article was created or the expansion began or it became a good article (not the date you submit it here), with the newest dates at the bottom. Any registered user may nominate a DYK suggestion (if you are not a registered user, please leave a message at the bottom of the DYK project talk page with the details of the article you would like to nominate and the hook you would like to propose); self-nominations are permitted and encouraged. Thanks for participating and please remember to check back for comments on your nomination (consider watchlisting your nomination page). Read these instructions completely before proceeding. For simplified instructions, see User:Rjanag/Quick DYK 2. I. Create the nomination subpage. Enter the article title in the box below and click the button. (To nominate multiple articles together, enter any or all of the article titles.) You will then be taken to a preloaded nomination page. II. Write the nomination. On the nomination page, fill in the relevant information. See Template:NewDYKnomination and {{NewDYKnomination/guide}} for further information. Not every line of the template needs to be filled in. For instance, if you are not nominating an image to appear with your hook, there is no need to fill in the image-related lines. Add an edit summary e.g. "Nominating YOUR ARTICLE TITLE for DYK" and click Publish page. Make sure the nomination page is on your watchlist, so you can follow the review discussion. III. Post at Template talk:Did you know. In the current nominations section find the subsection for the date on which the article was created or on which expansion began (or, if a new Good Article, the date on which it became a GA), not the date on which you make the nomination. At the top of that subsection (before other nominations already there, but below the section head and hidden comment) add {{Did you know nominations/YOUR ARTICLE TITLE}}. Add an edit summary e.g. "Nominating YOUR ARTICLE TITLE for DYK" and click Publish page. Frequently asked questions[edit] How do I write an interesting hook? Successful hooks tend to have several traits. Most importantly, they share a surprising or intriguing fact. They give readers enough context to understand the hook, but leave enough out to make them want to learn more. They are written for a general audience who has no prior knowledge of or interest in the topic area. Lastly, they are concise, and do not attempt to cover multiple facts or present information about the subject beyond what's needed to understand the hook. When will my nomination be reviewed? This page is often backlogged. As long as your submission is still on the page, it will stay there until an editor reviews it. Since editors are encouraged to review the oldest submissions first, it may take several weeks until your submission is reviewed. In the meantime, please consider reviewing another submission (not your own) to help reduce the backlog (see instructions below). Where is my hook? If you can't find the nomination you submitted to this nominations page, it may have been approved and is on the approved nominations page waiting to be promoted. It could also have been added to one of the prep areas, promoted from prep to a queue, or is on the main page. If the nominated hook is in none of those places, then the nomination has probably been rejected. Such a rejection usually only occurs if it was at least a couple of weeks old and had unresolved issues for which any discussion had gone stale. If you think your nomination was unfairly rejected, you can query this on the DYK discussion page, but as a general rule such nominations will only be restored in exceptional circumstances. Instructions for reviewers[edit] Main page: Wikipedia:Did you know/Reviewing guide Any editor who was not involved in writing/expanding or nominating an article may review it by checking to see that the article meets all the DYK criteria (long enough, new enough, no serious editorial or content issues) and the hook is cited. Editors may also alter the suggested hook to improve it, suggest new hooks, or even lend a hand and make edits to the article to which the hook applies so that the hook is supported and accurate. For a more detailed discussion of the DYK rules and review process see the supplementary guidelines and the WP:Did you know/Reviewing guide. To post a comment or review on a DYK nomination, follow the steps outlined below: Look through this page, Template talk:Did you know, to find a nomination you would like to comment on. Click the "Review or comment" link at the top of the nomination. You will be taken to the nomination subpage. The top of the page includes a list of the DYK criteria. Check the article to ensure it meets all the relevant criteria. To indicate the result of the review (i.e., whether the nomination passes, fails, or needs some minor changes), leave a signed comment on the page. Please begin with one of the 5 review symbols that appear at the top of the edit screen, and then indicate all aspects of the article that you have reviewed; your comment should look something like the following: Article length and age are fine, no copyvio or plagiarism concerns, reliable sources are used. But the hook needs to be shortened. If you are the first person to comment on the nomination, there will be a line :* <!-- REPLACE THIS LINE TO WRITE FIRST COMMENT, KEEPING  :* --> showing you where you should put the comment. Save the page. If there is any problem or concern about a nomination, please consider notifying the nominator by placing {{subst:DYKproblem|Article|header=yes|sig=yes}} on the nominator's talk page. Instructions for project members[edit] How to promote an accepted hook[edit] At-a-glance instructions on how to promote an approved hook to a Prep area See Wikipedia:Did you know/Preparation areas for details on verifying a hook's acceptability. Promoters should not promote their own nomination or their own review When promoting hooks intended for a particular date, keep in mind that when the number of available approved nominations exceeds 120 we switch to two sets per day, and when that number drops below 60 we return to one set per day. Check list for nomination review completeness 1) Select a hook from the approved nominations page that has one of these ticks at the bottom post: . 2) Check to make sure basic review requirements were completed. a. Any outstanding issue following needs to be addressed before promoting. 3) Check the article history for any substantive changes since it was nominated or reviewed. 4) Images for the lead slot must be freely licensed. Fair-use images are not permitted. Images loaded on Commons that appear on the Main Page are automatically protected by KrinkleBot. 5) Hook must be stated in both the article and source (which must be cited at the end of the article sentence where stated). 6) Hook should make sense grammatically. 7) Try to vary subject matters within each prep area. 8) Try to select a funny, quirky or otherwise upbeat hook for the last or bottom hook in the set. Steps to add a hook to prep In one tab, open the nomination page of the hook you want to promote. In a second tab, open the prep set you intend to add the hook to. 1) For hooks held for specific dates, refer to "Local update times" section on DYK Queue. a. Completed Prep area number sets will be promoted by an administrator to corresponding Queue number. 2) Copy and paste the hook into a chosen slot. a. Make sure there's a space between ... and that, and a ? at the end. b. Check that there's a bold link to the article. 3) If it's the lead (first) hook, paste the image where indicated at the top of the template. 4) Copy and paste ALL the credit information (the {{DYKmake}} and {{DYKnom}} templates) at the bottom 5) Check your work in the prep's Preview mode. a. At the bottom under "Credits", to the right of each article should have the link "View nom subpage" ; if not, a subpage parameter will need to be added to the DYKmake. 6) Save the Prep page. Closing the DYK nomination page At the upper left Change {{DYKsubpage to {{subst:DYKsubpage Change |passed= to |passed=yes At the bottom Just above the line containing }}<!--Please do not write below this line or remove this line. Place comments above this line.--> insert a new, separate line containing one of the following: To [[T:DYK/P1|Prep 1]] To [[T:DYK/P2|Prep 2]] To [[T:DYK/P3|Prep 3]] To [[T:DYK/P4|Prep 4]] To [[T:DYK/P5|Prep 5]] To [[T:DYK/P6|Prep 6]] To [[T:DYK/P7|Prep 7]] Also paste the same thing into the edit summary. Check in Preview mode. Make sure everything is against a pale blue background (nothing outside) and there are no stray characters, like }}, at the top or bottom. Save. For more information, please see T:TDYK#How to promote an accepted hook. Handy copy sources: To [[T:DYK/P1|Prep 1]] To [[T:DYK/P2|Prep 2]] To [[T:DYK/P3|Prep 3]] To [[T:DYK/P4|Prep 4]] To [[T:DYK/P5|Prep 5]] To [[T:DYK/P6|Prep 6]] To [[T:DYK/P7|Prep 7]] How to remove a rejected hook[edit] Open the DYK nomination subpage of the hook you would like to remove. (It's best to wait several days after a reviewer has rejected the hook, just in case someone contests or the article undergoes a large change.) In the window where the DYK nomination subpage is open, replace the line {{DYKsubpage with {{subst:DYKsubpage, and replace |passed= with |passed=no. Then save the page. This has the effect of wrapping up the discussion on the DYK nomination subpage in a blue archive box and stating that the nomination was unsuccessful, as well as adding the nomination to a category for archival purposes. How to remove a hook from the prep areas or queue[edit] Edit the prep area or queue where the hook is and remove the hook and the credits associated with it. Go to the hook's nomination subpage (there should have been a link to it in the credits section). View the edit history for that page Go back to the last version before the edit where the hook was promoted, and revert to that version to make the nomination active again. Add a new icon on the nomination subpage to cancel the previous tick and leave a comment after it explaining that the hook was removed from the prep area or queue, and why, so that later reviewers are aware of this issue. Add a transclusion of the template back to this page so that reviewers can see it. It goes under the date that it was first created/expanded/listed as a GA. You may need to add back the day header for that date if it had been removed from this page. If you removed the hook from a queue, it is best to either replace it with another hook from one of the prep areas, or to leave a message at WT:DYK asking someone else to do so. How to move a nomination subpage to a new name[edit] Don't; it should not ever be necessary, and will break some links which will later need to be repaired. Even if you change the title of the article, you don't need to move the nomination page. Nominations[edit] Older nominations[edit] Articles created/expanded on September 2[edit] Inger K.

Self-nominated at 14:12, 2 September 2021 (UTC). SportsOlympic has been blocked for sockpuppetry. Created by Cavalryman (talk) General: Article is new enough and long enough New Enough: Y Long Enough: Y Policy compliance: Adequate sourcing: N - Several problems here: Sources: "Olympedia – Inger K. Frith". www.olympedia.org. – this source is of questionable reliability. MRS. INGER FRITH, Olympic Review, 1971 – the link doesn’t work for me and there is inadequate bibliographic information for me to verify what it is. "Danish WW2 Pilots | Inger Kristine Frith (née Pragholm) (1909 - 1981)". www.danishww2pilots.dk. – I am satisfied a website run by Mikkel Plannthin about WWII Danish pilots is generally reliable (he has been published writing about this subject matter) but ... this seems to have been written largely from information gained in this forum thread and there is a big disclaimer at the bottom of this article raising some very significant discrepancies within the entry, which are included as fact in the article. Particularly the rank of Captain which never existed in the WAAF. I feel this raises questions about the reliability of the source. "Inger Frith blazed a trail for women in sports governance". www.insidethegames.biz. March 5, 2021. – looks reliable to me. The third paragraph in the WWII section is uncited. Filling more parameters in Template:Cite web, particularly authorship, would go a long way to presentation. Neutral: Y Free of copyright violations, plagiarism, and close paraphrasing: Y Other problems: N - The article misattributes several statements: likely the highest ranked Danish woman in service during the Second World War – the cited source states that she was the highest ranked that the author is aware of. She became a volunteer in the army in Cape Town and was later accepted for the Air Force – the cited source makes no mention of the Army. Hook eligibility: Cited: N - cites two sources with issues as described above Interesting: Y Other problems: N - perhaps base the hook on excellent insidethegames.biz article, something like “ that after serving in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War, Inger K. Frith became the first woman to lead a major international sporting federation and returned archery to the Olympics?” I have added it as a possible alternate above but am happy to play with it. QPQ: N - Not done Overall: I apologise if I seem to have been very harsh and I could be being very finicky, but the article is very clunky to read, with short little sentences and paragraphs that I feel don’t flow very well. Further, there is no such thing as the “British Air Force”, it is the United Kingdom’s air force or the Royal Air Force. Earwig shows 13.8% match to the Plannthin webpage, but I don’t think it breaches the COPYVIO threshold. Also QPQ is required. Cavalryman (talk) 04:08, 3 September 2021 (UTC). Hello @SportsOlympic: this nomination has been sitting here for almost a week and I can see you have not edited the article, nor have you supplied a QPQ. Are you still interested in pursuing the nomination? Cavalryman (talk) 12:56, 9 September 2021 (UTC). Olympedia are the same people as Sports Reference and is states at WP:Sports as reliable. It’s a pitty you can’t open the second source, is has great and reliable content. So the main issue is that it stated that she was Captain and the naming of the British Air Force? I’m not native English, so I can’t write it in high class English. As that is a problem, I can’t improve it to your satisfactions. I will rename the Air Force name and title of Captain because that might me wrong. Next to that, I don’t like your other option: it not mentioned she had a high rank and she was the first female at an sports federation SportsOlympic (talk) 20:24, 9 September 2021 (UTC) I can find no such reference at WP:Sports but perhaps I am missing something, there has only been one discussion at the reliable source noticeboard WP:Reliable sources/Noticeboard/Archive 335#Olympedia, that being said it is not used to cite anything controversial. Whilst you have made a couple of small fixes, you missed some of the nuance in my comments above particularly those points listed in green. Further, the claim in the hook to be high ranked depends upon if the rank of Captain (which is clearly wrong) is supposed to be an Army or a Navy Captain, a Captain in the Army is not high ranked, Navy is getting up there. As it stands I feel this article is not at the standard required to be featured on the main page, but I am happy for others to take a look at it. Cavalryman (talk) 22:38, 9 September 2021 (UTC). I have not looked at the article but would like to confirm that Olympedia is an authoritative source for Olympic bios. Schwede66 18:15, 13 September 2021 (UTC) Schwede66, many thanks, honestly Olympedia is the least of the issues here. Kind regards, Cavalryman (talk) 22:39, 13 September 2021 (UTC). It has been over a week and the nominator has made very little effort to rectify many of the issues raised above, nor have they supplied a QPQ (I was considering donating a QPQ if issues were rectified). They have received a TP notification [1] and been pinged above, so unfortunately I think this should be marked as ineligible and closed. Cavalryman (talk) 00:44, 17 September 2021 (UTC). Hi Cavalryman, I've done considerable cleanup work on the article, finding published sources for a good bit of the material, and rewriting some parts based on the additions. This one should get a whole new review. Mary Mark Ockerbloom (talk) 06:40, 17 September 2021 (UTC) It might need a new hook too: ALT4:... that after serving as a meteorological officer in the Second World War, Inger K.

This quote needs in-text attribution. DONE It's getting closer, with some of the issues raised in the first review have still not been resolved, and care needs to taken to ensure the correct source is used to cite certain pieces of information. I have struck ALT0 because we have now clarified that she was not "a high ranked pilot during World War II". Cavalryman (talk) 04:03, 20 September 2021 (UTC). I have also struck my first ALT1 as she did not serve in the RAF but instead served in the SAAF, so have added ALT2, with no preference between it and ALT4.

Unfortunately, Cavalryman, there were two hooks labeled ALT3. I renamed the second one "ALT4", but you should specify whether you were referring to the first ALT3 or the one now called ALT4. MANdARAX • XA?Ab?AM 21:08, 5 October 2021 (UTC) @Mandarax: yes I can see the second ALT3 was added here, I have amended my comment accordingly. Kind regards, Cavalryman (talk) 21:46, 5 October 2021 (UTC). I have copy-edited the article. She served in both the Women's RAF and the SAAF, but I am not sure that the article needs to be held up over debates about her wartime service. I have proposed an alternative that just focuses on her role in sports. The article is worth including in DYK, so I am happy to step in a help get it finished. The sources seem credible to me. Are there other issues left? PMCH2 (talk) 22:46, 26 September 2021 (UTC) Respectfully, not all of the issues raised in the above review have been addressed. Further, then sent to Cairo where she transferred from the SAAF to Great Britain's Women's Royal Air Force, receiving a commission contradicts the preceding paragraph that says she served ... in the South African Air Force (SAAF) from 23 October 1941 to 21 July 1945 and the fact that to have been a Second Lieutenant she must already have been a commissioned officer. Cavalryman (talk) 12:49, 27 September 2021 (UTC). I have added archive links for sources that don't have authors. I removed the one link that didn't work. Others have appropriate details. I have replied above to the concerns I have addressed. I removed the phrase about the commission. I have done my best to address all the issues. PMCH2 (talk) 03:26, 3 October 2021 (UTC) @PMCH2: when I get a chance I will have another detailed look. At a cursory glance, there is still plenty of room to add more bibliographic information to the citations, for instance the www.danishww2pilots.dk source should be: Plannthin, Mikkel (12 September 2010). "Inger Kristine Frith (née Pragholm)". Danish WW2 Pilots. Archived from the original on 31 August 2021. Retrieved 29 August 2021. I will look at the rest soon. Also, a QPQ still has not been provided. Cavalryman (talk) 21:59, 5 October 2021 (UTC). I haven't seen a DYK be scrutinized this closely before in regards to citations. I stepped in to try to help, but it's not my article, and I have spent as much time as I can. You seem to have a very high bar. I don't have a DYK credit to donate. 22:57, 7 October 2021 (UTC) I am sorry you think I am being overly harsh, but I think it is plain sloppy not including proper attribution, and the with the example above I think the fact that the same author is responsible for two cited sources is relevant. I initially reviewed the article because I thought the subject was interesting and worthy of some time in the main page sun. But I too have found it frustrating, I have conducted two complete reviews and even then my findings have not been acted upon, and further still there has been a stunningly consistent lack of attention to detail. I will now do some editing of the article to bring it up to a standard I believe is required. Cavalryman (talk) 01:28, 8 October 2021 (UTC). Thanks for your edits on the article. It reads better and I can see you have cleaned up the sources. I will do a QPQ this weekend, so we can get this over the line.PMCH2 (talk) 12:41, 10 October 2021 (UTC) Many thanks. If you cannot I will try to do one. I also intend to email World Archery to see if we can get a photo. Regards, Cavalryman (talk) 13:13, 10 October 2021 (UTC). I have reviewed Kennin Rebellion for DYK. Thanks for chasing down a photo - that would be great.PMCH2 (talk) 14:03, 12 October 2021 (UTC) Many thanks. Re photo I have been had correspondence with World Archery and they have said we can use the 1961 photo in this article, I am just trying to get them to confirm what license they are happy to release it under. Given I am now responsible for over 70% of the text [2], should a fresh reviewer have a look at this? Cavalryman (talk) 22:10, 12 October 2021 (UTC). After some initial positive correspondence World Archery not responded about licenses for almost a week. I will send one more email but am not holding my breath that a photo will be released. Cavalryman (talk) 22:29, 17 October 2021 (UTC). yeah, I think we're going to need a new reviewer on this one. Cavalryman, given your contributions to getting this article to DYK, I've added you to the credits section. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 20:04, 18 October 2021 (UTC) As best I can tell, the major issues concerning sourcing and attribution have been addressed, and this article seems ready for the main page. Thanks to everyone who contributed to make this work. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 04:54, 20 October 2021 (UTC) @Theleekycauldron: if a photo is released I will ping you to see if you are happy for it to be added to the nomination. Kind regards, Cavalryman (talk) 05:09, 20 October 2021 (UTC). Re photo ... the person I have been corresponding with at World Archery needs to return to the office to confirm their ownership status of this picture, due to covid that cannot occur before 4th November. I request this be held off until then. Cavalryman (talk) 09:50, 20 October 2021 (UTC). @Cavalryman: happy to wait. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 20:23, 21 October 2021 (UTC) Any updates on the image? If we waiting just for the image, I'll suggest to let this nomination run without an image. – Kavyansh.Singh (talk) 08:03, 30 October 2021 (UTC) As said above I do not expect any word before the 4th of November. If there is a chronic shortage of articles for DYK then by all means run this, but it would be a shame to potentially deny this most capable woman a face when she is featured for the sake of a week. Cavalryman (talk) 10:08, 31 October 2021 (UTC). There is no shortage of hooks on DYK. I was just concerned about how backlogged this particular nomination is. If it is worth waiting for the image, no issues then. – Kavyansh.Singh (talk) 10:19, 31 October 2021 (UTC) I have just received this in an email from World Archery: I checked last Thursday in our old history books, but there is no mention of photographer there. However, I'm on another track that was given to me by the author of another book on the history of our federation, but I'll have to check it out this Thursday when I'm again in the office. Things are in progress, and I should be able to give you some good news by next week! If everyone is happy to wait a few more days hopefully we’ll have a photo. Cavalryman (talk) 08:07, 8 November 2021 (UTC). @Cavalryman: Any updates? I think this should get promoted within a week if an image doesn't materialize. Side note to @BlueMoonset: original nom has been blocked for socking, do they still get a credit? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 05:13, 17 November 2021 (UTC) theleekycauldron, I'm trying to remember. Why don't you ask at WT:DYK and see whether there are any recollections about past cases, or strong opinions either way. Sorry I can't be more definitive. On the matter of promoting, the nomination will be three months old on December 2, and should have been promoted prior to then. BlueMoonset (talk) 05:30, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I see Wikipedia talk:Did you know/Archive 152#Multiple DYK nominations in process by newly checkuser-blocked sockpuppet: how to proceed?, which ended up with every nom made by the sock being rejected. Since this one's been adopted, We shouldn't close this nom, it's been adopted, but I am striking their credit. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 05:46, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Apologies, I was going to give an update this morning (Australian time). I had an email overnight from World Archery wanting to clarify the process of uploading a picture, I wouldn’t mind betting there will be an email with photo attached in the inbox at permissions@wikimedia.org tomorrow Swiss time. I agree, if there is no image within a week promote it, this has been a lengthy process. Cavalryman (talk) 06:03, 17 November 2021 (UTC).

Self-nominated at 08:59, 29 September 2021 (UTC). The article needs copyediting first. In addition, the table in the article is mostly empty. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 11:42, 12 October 2021 (UTC) Thanks for your suggestion. Table moved to sandbox for further expansion. Cerevisae (talk) 13:35, 17 October 2021 (UTC) @Narutolovehinata5: I have carried out some copyedits, let me know if there are areas that need another run-through. CMD (talk) 07:59, 24 October 2021 (UTC) Apologies for the late reply! Anyway, ALT0 is probably the best hook among the three proposed (ALT1 seems unimpressive to me while ALT2 may need additional context). However, the sentence verifying ALT0 doesn't have a footnote; instead, the references for it are spread across other nearby sentences instead, duplication is needed here for DYK purposes. In addition, it may be a good idea to propose an additional hook about Sarawak being the biggest timber exporter in the 1980s since that fact seems more interesting than the others discussed here. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 06:53, 1 November 2021 (UTC) added ALT 3. Cerevisae (talk) 04:30, 5 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you for the proposal; however, I feel that it may not meet WP:EGG. Would it be possible to rewrite ALT3 to make the link to "Economy of Sarawak" clearer? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 06:52, 5 November 2021 (UTC) talk, ALT 3 changed. Cerevisae (talk) 14:23, 8 November 2021 (UTC) ALT3 reads better, but it may still need to be copyedited for grammar. In addition it lacks a bold link to the DYK article subject. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:29, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Hook copyedited. CMD (talk) 07:03, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you for the edits. Now the article was new enough and long enough at the time of the nomination and no close paraphrasing was found. However, there are still a number of outstanding issues. Firstly, the sentence that mentions the main hook fact is lacking a footnote, with the relevant reference instead coming at the end of the paragraph where the fact is located at; duplication is necessary here per DYK rules. Secondly, the article doesn't say that the timber industry contributed "greatly" to Sarawak's economy: I would suggest deleting the word "greatly" from the hook, with the rest of that part being accepted as it's implied by the rest of the article. Thirdly, a QPQ has yet to be provided; this was the nominator's sixth nomination, so a QPQ should have been provided at the time of the nomination or within a week of then.

Source: Wells (2003), The Battle That Stopped Rome, pp. 206–7 Improved to Good Article status by SpartaN (talk). Self-nominated at 03:34, 29 September 2021 (UTC). General eligibility: New Enough: Y Long Enough: Y Other problems: Y Policy compliance: Adequate sourcing: Y Neutral: Y Free of copyright violations, plagiarism, and close paraphrasing: Y Other problems: Y Hook eligibility: Cited: N - Source is offline but happy to AGF. However, in the article the statement “they considered German lands too poor for annexation” is sourced to p.204 of Wells. pp.206-7 referred to above is used to support that they that “it was too costly in economic and military resources” to go into in Germany. I guess either way the hook is sourced but could you clarify the exact sourcing of the hook. Interesting: Y QPQ: None required. Overall: Interesting thorough article, well-written with good quality sourcing. Earwig shows no issues. Just a minor query around the hook sourcing but otherwise will be good to go. DeCausa (talk) 08:23, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @DeCausa: I found the web link that (for me) shows a preview if you're able to see it: https://books.google.com/books?id=mc30CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA206&lpg=PA206 SpartaN (talk) 10:07, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @SpartaN: Thanks for providing the link. It’s prompted a couple of thoughts for me. Firstly, Wells doesn’t seem to be saying the reason for the withdrawal is definitively known (“… the reasons for these decisions must have lain…”) i.e he’s making an assumption, however well founded. The hook is more definite than Wells is. Secondly, Wells’ emphasis is on the strength of the resistance being behind the reason - the poor value of the territory makes it “not worth it” because of the strength of the resistance. That’s not quite the same as just saying the land wasn’t valuable. (I notice the text you used in the article on this reflects that effort/value ratio issue.) To fix both points would you be prepared to consider an ALT1 which after “…Teutoburg” continues something along the lines of “…likely decided to leave Germany because the military effort was out of proportion to the territory’s value?” although there may need to be some trimming to get it into the 200 character limit. DeCausa (talk) 11:12, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @SpartaN and DeCausa: It's been over a month since the last comments here, have there been any updates? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:31, 13 November 2021 (UTC) From my point of view I’m waiting for SpartaN’s reply to my last post here. But I notice they haven’t edited Wikipedia since then, over a month ago. So I’m not quite sure what can be done. DeCausa (talk) 08:17, 13 November 2021 (UTC) I see. Given that there's really only one issue holding the nomination back, would anyone be willing to adopt this in case SpartaN doesn't return? It would be a shame if the nomination failed at this point. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 06:35, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I’m not sure what exactly are the DYK rules on this but, subject to that, options could be (a) I propose an ALT1 hook and someone else signs it off; (b) someone else proposes an ALT1 hook and I sign it off; (c) if anyone disagrees with me on the original hook I’m happy to step away and they sign it off. DeCausa (talk) 11:04, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I've looked at the Wells source and concur that it is saying the withdrawal was more down to the ratio of effort required to potential reward, and have boldly tweaked the copy in the article to reflect this. For what it's worth, I think ALT1 works just fine. firefly ( t · c ) 11:16, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Ok. I’m just going to formalize the ALT1 and let someone else add the tick and sign off: ALT1:... that the Romans won a series of campaigns against the Germanic tribes after the disaster at Teutoburg but likely decided to leave Germany as the effort was out of proportion to the territory’s value? DeCausa (talk) 12:07, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Since the reviewer has proposed a new hook, another editor will be needed to sign this off. I'm not sure though if the section linking in the bold links is allowed, however. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:29, 15 November 2021 (UTC) sorry, I missed that. It’s not even necessary to link to a section of the article so I’ve taken it out of ALT1.

Self-nominated at 11:39, 5 October 2021 (UTC). – The article is long enough (16,688 characters) and new enough (created on October 4, 2021). It cites various sources, and Earwig's Copyvio detector shows 29.1% similarity (violation unlikely). But ... It has few neutrality issues including a neutrality tag. The hook seems fine, and maybe cited in the article. Can we have a source here? Rest, a QPQ has been done. Till the neutrality concerns are resolved, this DYK nomination should be on hold. – Kavyansh.Singh (talk) 06:57, 20 October 2021 (UTC) Kavyansh.Singh I rewrote the disputed section based on more reliable sources. Unfortunately, it was reverted immediately by ?Khirurg who appears to think that the New York Times is not a reliable source. Perhaps they would explain here why they object. (t · c) buidhe 03:05, 24 October 2021 (UTC) Yeah you rewrote it alright - by removing a whole bunch of sources. Maybe you can explain why AP is not reliable source? Perhaps you can also explain why you removed the POV tag, even though your edit did not address any of the issues raised in the talkpage? Khirurg (talk) 03:07, 24 October 2021 (UTC) Khirurg : Hi, I don't think the AP source supports the content it's cited for. The AP source reports that Greece has made certain accusations, it doesn't say whether they are correct or not. I'm not sure how Greek accusations against Turkey (regardless of whether they are correct or not) have any bearing about this article, which is about Greece. Cleanup tags should be removed unless there is active discussion ongoing and the person placing it can substantiate that there is a problem with the article. (t · c) buidhe 03:14, 24 October 2021 (UTC) Not only you removed AP news, you also removed the Brussels International Center. Your edits made the article even more POV, by trying to spin away the hostile actions of the Turkish government. And it's not a "cleanup tag", it's POV tag, and there is very much an active discussion going on, first of all right here. If you are avoiding the article talkpage and spin that "no discussion ongoing", that's not going to work. Khirurg (talk) 03:23, 24 October 2021 (UTC) Khirurg Actually I have no opinion on the reliability of BIC at this point, but I hesitate to cite think tanks when there are better sources available (I cited the New York Times, Verfassungsblog and an academic paper, all of which are higher quality than a think tank). I checked several sources and all of them mention that the main change in February-March 2020 was opening the border to migrants, some also mention that Turkey bussed migrants to the border or that at least one incident of coercing migrants was reported. Your wording suggests that all or many migrants since then were coerced to travel to Greece. This is misleading because few if any reliable sources support coercive "push" tactics being a widespread or systematic practice by Turkey at its border with Greece. (t · c) buidhe 04:02, 24 October 2021 (UTC) Not only is BIC itself a perfectly reliable source (much more so than the partisan NGOs you have filled the article with), but it's really not hard to find sources about the Turkish government coercing migrants to the border [3]. This assume of course that one in inclined to look for sources, instead of pretending they don't exist. And here [4] (and then doubled down [5], you seem to have followed me to a Requested Move I recently participated in, in what appears to be clear WP:HOUND behavior. So everyone can see what's going on here. Khirurg (talk) 00:47, 25 October 2021 (UTC) Okay, coming back to the DYK criteria, this seems to meet everything except the neutrality issues. I see that there has been no active discussion on the talk page form at-least 17 days. @Buidhe Any updates on @Khirurg's concerns? I can' formally approve this until the neutrality concerns are resolved. – Kavyansh.Singh (talk) 16:28, 25 October 2021 (UTC) @Kavyansh.Singh, Buidhe, and Khirurg: this nomination should probably be closed if the neutrality concerns are not resolved one way or another. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 01:21, 10 November 2021 (UTC) Great, now you can filibuster DYKs you don't like by raising spurious "concerns" and inserting loaded language. (t · c) buidhe 01:34, 10 November 2021 (UTC) What "loaded language"? I raised my concerns in the talkpage, and you've done nothing but edit-war since then. Khirurg (talk) 01:54, 10 November 2021 (UTC) The most egregiously loaded language I recall was a human rights violation that encapsulates a will to eliminate a person’s presence on the face of the planet, which was added by you. Khirurg (talk) 02:02, 10 November 2021 (UTC) You insist on inserting loaded language like "Weaponization of migration" and "coercive engineered migration" which simply do not reflect the majority reliable sources (and are only tangentially related to the article topic, because they are accusations against Turkey rather than Greece) as explained above. I explained that you have misrepresented sources as seen above, and substituted opinion pieces for news coverage and peer-reviewed academic papers, and all you do is revert. So it's unclear to me how any progress can be made here. (t · c) buidhe 02:07, 10 November 2021 (UTC) Everything I have added is sourced to reliable sources. As far as opinion pieces, you're the one that has added those, such as this opinion piece written by grad students [6]. You haven't made the slightest effort to meet me halfway, instead you just blanket-revert all my additions claiming "my sources are better than yours". No attempt at dispute resolution, just blanket reverts like this [7]. The article is mainly based on activist NGO sources. Yes, there can be no progress under these conditions. Khirurg (talk) 02:45, 10 November 2021 (UTC) You literally replaced a news article from the New York Times and academic paper with an opinion piece from The Hill regarding the March 2020 escalation in order to replace fact-based description with loaded language of "weaponization". I did not cite any opinion pieces in the article, and it's a lie to say that the article is "mainly based on activist NGO sources". (t · c) buidhe 03:37, 10 November 2021 (UTC) (Personal attack removed). I just linked to an opinion piece you put in the article in my previous post. InfoMigrants, Mare Liberum, Aegean Boat Report are all activist NGOs used as references (to name just a few). The only way to resolve this is through some form of third party mediation. Would you be agreeable to something like that, yes or no? Khirurg (talk) 04:01, 10 November 2021 (UTC) That's simply untrue, InfoMigrants is a journalism outfit based on a media partnership, not a NGO let alone an "activist" one, and the EJIL Talk piece is expert analysis, not from their editorial section. As for third party mediation, sure why not? But I can't see the use in repeating points that were ignored the first time. (t · c) buidhe 12:11, 10 November 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: imho, the best way to break a filibuster is the old fashioned way: cloture motion. I'd recommend that you get as many eyes on this as possible, see if a clearer consensus falls out. my confidence in either of you conceding your point is dwindling, so this back-and-forth seems unhelpful, as you both pointed out. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 08:52, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Articles created/expanded on October 9[edit] Pankratius Pfeiffer ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that Salvatorian priest Pankratius Pfeiffer saved hundreds of Jews in Rome during the Second World War? Reviewed: 1936 Northeast Flood Created by Ergo Sum (talk). Self-nominated at 17:52, 9 October 2021 (UTC). New article that was created on 9 October 2021? is 3,212 characters and nominated on the same day. No copyvios detected and duplication detector of [8][9][10][11][12] reveal no close paraphrasing issues (AGF PDF docs which can't go through Dup detector). Article is well-sourced. Hook is 103 characters long (under 200 character max.) and is interesting. Refs 4 and 5 (verifying the hook) are reliable sources. QPQ done. Looks good to go! —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:41, 9 October 2021 (UTC) Too many red flags here. If he really saved hundreds of Jews, you would expect plenty of confirmation of this in scholarly sources and him to be recognized by Yad Vashem. I can't count the number of times that I've seen mainstream newspapers print completely false stories about Jews being rescued during the holocaust, so better sources are definitely needed to confirm these extraordinary claims. Thanks Brigade Piron for letting me know about this. (t · c) buidhe 16:51, 10 October 2021 (UTC) I have to admit I'm just a bit perplexed by the argument. Except in fairly uncommon cases of multiple RS that contradict each other, we don't generally recognize any "hierarchy" of reliable sources. Sources are either RS or they are not. So I'm not sure what kind of sources you have in mind as "better" sources. The ones currently cited in the article are all RS, so that should be the end of it. I might add that if you seek some manner of official imprimatur in the vein of Yad Vashem, the City of Rome named a street after him. Your point about why there isn't more extensive coverage of this historical figure is well taken but can easily be attributed to the fact that all manner of historical figures are lost to history, especially those who are notable really for one major event in their life that did not come to light until years later, as is the case here. Indeed, one of the RS in this article describes Pfeiffer as being "lost to history." I'm adding the new review icon here so that we can get at least one more editor's evaluation of this. Ergo Sum 13:32, 16 October 2021 (UTC) There are very few people who actually saved hundreds of Jews during the Holocaust and plenty of hoaxes that were reported as truth by various news organizations—for example Necdet Kent. In other cases, actual rescue did occur but the numbers are greatly exaggerated and repeated uncritically by news organizations, such as Raoul Wallenberg. If the story is true you would expect to see it covered in many more credible sources. There are plenty of cases where a source is reliable for some info but not others. For example, someone's CV is often reliable for "they worked at X organization" but not "they are a world expert in Z". Extraordinary claims require extraordinary sourcing. (t · c) buidhe 21:27, 16 October 2021 (UTC) I should say that I share Buidhe's concerns. I think saying that "all manner of historical figures are lost to history" rather side-steps the sheer volume of historical scholarship on all aspects of the Holocaust. On a more banal note, I think part of the problem is that the sources cited are, essentially, all journalistic sources published by explicitly Catholic or Salvatorian outlets. The specific sources cited for the "saved" claim are Romereports (I am not familiar with this outlet, but the typo in the video does not inspire confidence) and a self-published Salvatorian newsletter. Neither are scholarly sources and both are, again, explicitly confessional in nature. I think WP:BIASED may on point in a highly sensitive issue touching on the wider disputes about Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust. Do we know what the Samerski book says, for example? —Brigade Piron (talk) 08:55, 17 October 2021 (UTC) Buidhe It is true that the sources cover Catholic issues, but only the Salvatorian one is actually published by a Catholic institution. I need not go into how varied Catholic newspapers are in their adherence/faithfulness to the Catholic hierarchy and beliefs (see e.g. National Catholic Reporter versus National Catholic Register). But more direclty, there actually are many scholarly RS that discussion Pfeiffer and his works in Nazi-occupied Rome. You will find them on the other language versions of this article. The problem is that I do not read Italian or German well enough to use them in the article. Coverage is not the issue. It is English language coverage. Ergo Sum 13:48, 17 October 2021 (UTC) @Ergo Sum: perhaps add the word "reportedly" before "saved". I'm inclined to accept in good faith the sources used as reliable – none of them have not been deprecated nor deemed generally unreliable. —Bloom6132 (talk) 16:41, 26 October 2021 (UTC) DYK should not cover unconfirmed reports or rumors so I strongly disagree with that suggestion. As well as assuming sources are reliable if they've never been discussed at WP:RSN, which disregards important parts of WP:RS such as WP:CONTEXTMATTERS. There is no issue with citing sources in Italian or German, but if it's not confirmed that they support the content then it's incorrect to assume that they do. (t · c) buidhe 20:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Bloom6132: I tend to think that statements are either supported by RS and written in wikivoice or they're not accepted at all. For that reason, I shy away from words like "reportedly." I reiterate though that I think it's quite clear there's nothing wrong with the sources currently used. They're all RS, so that should be the end of it. Hence, why I think your initial review was satisfactory. Ergo Sum 23:40, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Ergo Sum: agreed. I'm still of the view that the hook satisfies criteria 3b. Criteria 4 states that "Nominations should be rejected if an inspection reveals that they are not based on reliable sources". That is not the case here. —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) You're still ignoring the principle in RS that context matters, and some sources are reliable for some but not other info. The two of us who actually write on Holocaust related topics have expressed that the sources cited are not reliable for the exceptional claims being made. (t · c) buidhe 23:59, 26 October 2021 (UTC) With all due respect, I am of the opinion that the sources used are reliable for the info in the hook. The fact that you and Brigade Piron write on Holocaust-related topics is irrelevant – it does not confer a veto over hooks pertaining to that subject. By that logic, I should be able to veto baseball or heraldry hooks ... —Bloom6132 (talk) 01:10, 27 October 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: Three of my DYKs promoted (including Coat of arms of the Falkland Islands from August this year) have included the word "reportedly" in the hook, as well as numerous hooks from other editors. Disagree all you want – this is accepted practice at DYK. —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: I'm aware that you have experience writing about Holocaust-related articles and I put value in your assessment as a solid editor. However, I'm quite comfortable in my ability to vet RS, as well, and my confidence in these sources means I must disagree with your opinion here. Experienced editors do disagree at times, and it is my opinion that I think you have gotten this one wrong; doubtless, you think the same for me. I haven't seen any evidence that these are not RS. Therefore, I recommend if Bloom6132 is inclined to do so, to renew their approval of the hook. In the meantime, I'm going to request the input of additional experienced editors on the DYK talk page. Ergo Sum 01:28, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm going to ping @Bamse, Bermicourt, Jmabel, and Anyfile to see if we can find some reliable sources in other languages. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 01:46, 27 October 2021 (UTC) Oops, @AnyFile theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 01:47, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm currently traveling & very busy, so not much help here, I'm afraid. - Jmabel | Talk 01:53, 27 October 2021 (UTC) That said, more or less this same case is made in The Pope's Jews: The Vatican's Secret Plan to Save Jews from the Nazis by Gordon Thomas (not currently cited in the article). - Jmabel | Talk 02:00, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm unclear as to why the cited sources are unreliable: are we assuming that all information emanating from a Roman Catholic source is unreliable? If so what's the logic? In any case there are dozens of book sources in English, German, French and Italian that mention Pfeiffer, the problem is that few are accessible online. One is an entire biography of Pfeiffer "from baker to Vatican diplomat" which would be useful to track down: Willer, Philomena (2005). P. Pankratius Pfeiffer SDS: (1872-1945); vom Bäckergesellen zum Vatikandiplomat. Pub: Josef Fink. Others that mentions Pfeiffer and the Jews in Rome are: Liebhart (1996) Schwangau. Meding (1992), Flucht vor Nürnberg. Sinn (1976), Illegal. Bermicourt (talk) 08:41, 27 October 2021 (UTC) My issue is with the unreliability of journalistic works and popular history, which have in many cases published inaccurate information about rescues of Jews during the Holocaust. If better sources exist, they should be cited instead. An additional question is, do these sources actually support the claim of "hundreds" of Jews rescued by Pfeiffer personally? (t · c) buidhe 08:51, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I've now found sources that cover most of the article. Here are more: Liebhart (1996) Schwangau. Meding (1992), Flucht vor Nürnberg. Sinn (1976), Illegal. Prince Constantine of Bavaria (1952) Der Papst. Layer (1985), Schwäbisches Ehrenbuch - Pfeiffer credited with "saving Rome and other Italian cities including Chieti, Ascoli and Ovieto from destruction and other calamities" _ (1999). Publik-Forum - Pfeiffer the only German to have a street named after him in Rome and who fought to save Roman Jews. _ (1960). Bayerische Frömmigkeit - Pfeiffer described as the "Saviour of Rome and other cities in Italy" Robert Katz has written a number of books - Death in Rome (1967), Black Sabbath (1969), The Battle for Rome (2010) - which all mention Pfeiffer. Bottum and Dalin (2004). The Pius War has this interesting piece: "7. Pancrazio [sic] Pfeiffer. According to Carroll-Abbing, one of the men used by Pius XII to protest the Nazi roundup of Rome's Jews and intervene for persecuted victims was Father Pancrazio Pfeiffer, superior general of the Salvatorian Fathers, who also served as Pius XII' personal liaison to the German military command in Rome. Because Pfeiffer died tragically in an automobile accident toward the end of the war and thus never took part in the postwar analysis of Pius XII's conduct, many historians have overlooked him. But those who knew him or have researched his life have chronicled his collaborative efforts with Pius XII to rescue Jews and others during the war. See the article "Pfeiffer's List" by Robert Graham, 30 Days, June 1994, pp. 42-46. Prince Constantine of Bavaria's book on Pius XII, The Pope (London: Allan Wingate, 1954) [listed above] contains an excellent section on Pfeiffer, whom he describes as an agent for the pope on behalf of the victims of persecution and the fugitives in hiding" (p. 213). At Pfeiffer's death in May 1945, Vatican Radio paid tribute: "He came into contact with the Commander of the German occupying forces [in Rome in 1943-44]. From that day onwards, he placed his religious and spiritual qualities at the service of many who had been arrested or already condemned to death. He helped countless people in this way, and saved their lives, among them many Jews and other Italian personages. He championed..." In short there seems to be book evidence for virtually everything stated in the article apart from the specific details of the two incidents where 249 or 400 Jews were rescued. Based on my initial searches my expectation is that those incidents are likely to be recorded in the literature - we just need to be able to access more of the sources. Meanwhile there is no harm in pausing to use some of the above sources, plus those I've added to the Further reading section of the article in order to reinforce the existing references and then review where we are.

For example, Salvatorians USA Province is not independent of the article subject and therefore is not reliable for self-serving assertions such as "he saved many Jews in Rome from persecution and ultimately death" or "Every day, Pfeiffer visited the Regina Coeli prison and another prison on Via Tasso, where he would often return with freed prisoners who had been sentenced to death." (t · c) buidhe 08:27, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: would you still object if the article instead relied on the sources found by Bermicourt? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 04:58, 5 November 2021 (UTC) Depends, the Samerski source looks reliable to me but the book published by "Österreichische Provinz der Salvatorianer" has the same issue of close connection to the article subject. (t · c) buidhe 06:27, 5 November 2021 (UTC) All right. @Ergo Sum: I'm not going to promote the nomination without consensus to move forward, so if you want to try and rework the article's sourcing to approval, that can work.

This slipped my mind completely this weekend. I will deal with this tonight. Ergo Sum 15:45, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I have added several inline citations to the article, which refer to sources that were (very helpfully) added by Bermicourt. These sources support several of the very specific claims in the article, as well as the general thrust of the article which is in dispute here, namely that Pfeiffer was a liaison and in that capacity saved many Jews and others from the Nazis. In light of these reliable sources supporting the general claims, I think any concern about the pre-existing ones describing some of his more specific actions is ameliorated. There is a trove of additional sources in the Further Reading section that additionally describe in much greater detail Pfeiffer's actions but they are either in a foreign language which I do not adequately read to make use of as citations or are offline. All being said, I think there is now ample sourcing to back up the article's claims. Ergo Sum 05:49, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks, Ergo Sum—@Buidhe:, if this sourcing is up to your standards, we can move ahead. If not, we're probably going back to WT:DYK and asking for more eyes. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 05:52, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Hi, I've flagged the specific content in the article that supports the hook as needing a better source. There are other active cleanup tags on the article as well. However, I think there's sufficient sourcing for a modified version of the hook without the words "hundreds of". (t · c) buidhe 06:06, 17 November 2021 (UTC) We could cite "countless" using the ref above instead of "hundreds of". Bermicourt (talk) 08:33, 17 November 2021 (UTC) According to the source it's what Vatican Radio said about him after his death. DYK is not for eulogies imo. (t · c) buidhe 08:37, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I'm not following—is the source unreliable because it's after his death? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 08:40, 17 November 2021 (UTC) No, it's because it's Catholic presumably... We could always add "according to Vatican Radio..." But better still, we just need to cite the exact text from one of the many non-Catholic book sources and the problem will be solved. Bermicourt (talk) 08:46, 17 November 2021 (UTC) And yet another source: O'Reilly (2001) in Forgotten Battles: Italy's War of Liberation 1943-45 states that "the Vatican was able to assist many of Rome's Jews and others sought by the Germans through Father Pancrazio Pfeiffer's intervention with the Germans... His work was recounted by Robert Graham who has written extensively on the Vatican's role in World War II." Bermicourt (talk) 09:01, 17 November 2021 (UTC) And another: Bartley (2016) in Catholics Confronting Hitler states that "Father Pancrace [sic] Pfeiffer, a German priest and the superior general of the Salvatorian Order, was the pope's liaison with the German military. Several hundred hostages, including some under sentence of death, owed their release to the efficacious intervention of Father Pfeiffer." I don't know why I'm doing this - you can look up the references yourselves instead of opining and speculating from the sidelines in the classic Wikipedia way. :) Bermicourt (talk) 09:08, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @Bermicourt: Since it seems you have access to several sources that I do not (probably just requires further digging), would you want to add them as inline citations with page numbers, especially to support the proposition regarding hundreds of people saved?

I'd be in favor instead of the hook being split into two separate proposals: one hook about the fact that she was an internet celebrity who grew up in a place without tap water, and a separate hook about her going viral for making hamburgers. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:23, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Full review needed, which can also address the issue of the borderline ALT1 hook. BlueMoonset (talk) 04:23, 5 November 2021 (UTC) As far as I can tell the article meets DYK requirements, and a QPQ has been done. Earwigs finds a close match with Coda Media, but that's only because it was the source for quotes in the article, and all of them are properly referenced. I find the first hook hard to believe given China's international standing, and in any case as brought up by Bowlhover may be inaccurate anyway. As for the second hook, as I mentioned before it's ineligible as it's exactly 200 characters long, and per WP:DYK hooks that are at or shorter than 200 characters may be rejected per reviewer's discretion. Both ALT0 and ALT1 have struck: I am repeating my earlier suggestion that ALT1 instead be split into two separate hooks. As this is a China-related article and there appear to be some political discussion in the article, I'd also like to ask for a second opinion from someone more knowledgeable about China-related articles if the article doesn't fall afoul of relevant guidelines. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 13:12, 6 November 2021 (UTC) From Wikipedia:Did you know#The hook: The hook should be concise: no more than about 200 characters (including spaces and the question mark, but not including the ..., the space immediately following the ..., or any (pictured)). While 200 is a hard limit, hooks near or at this limit may still be rejected at the discretion of reviewers and administrators. This tool can be used for counting words. The guideline says that "200 is a hard limit", so it is not true that the 200-character ALT1 hook is "ineligible" or "simply too long". No reason has been given for rejecting a 200-character hook "at the discretion of reviewers". Here are two additional hooks based on the suggestion: ALT2: ... that Dianxi Xiaoge, who grew up in a remote Yunnan mountain without running water, is an Internet celebrity with roughly 16 million subscribers on all her platforms? ALT3: ... Dianxi Xiaoge went viral in China and internationally after making hamburgers for her grandparents who had never eaten them before? Cunard (talk) 07:48, 7 November 2021 (UTC) Well for one thing, the original was very difficult to read and seemed to combine too many facts into one hook. Usually DYK prefers simpler hooks whenever possible. In any case, I think ALT3 is the best hook here and the nomination is otherwise good to go, I'd just like to hear a second opinion from another editor on the article tone given that I'm a bit uncomfortable doing a solo review here given the "Commentary" section delves into some political matters. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:36, 7 November 2021 (UTC) On second thought, I have some concerns regarding the length of the article.

Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 11:10, 7 November 2021 (UTC) That the article is "rather detailed for an internet celebrity's page" should not be a concern.

Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:57, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I don't think we need Gatoclass to restate themself. Here's what they said at WT:DYK: The article doesn't use the phrase "one of only three Chinese influencers to gain international influence", so I'm not sure where you got that, but it does say she is one of only three "Chinese Internet celebrities who have reached international prominence", and the problem with that claim is that it's sourced to an article that is two years old and therefore not up-to-date. With regard to the overall length, I would agree that it is overly detailed and could use a trim. I'm not sure this is relevant to DYK however, as "overly detailed" is not one of our criteria. What I would say is that the level of detail does raise the chances of close paraphrasing so the article would need to be carefully checked for that. Anybody else with an opinion on this article?

Since that's technically a plot point I don't think it would meet the guideline. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:20, 11 November 2021 (UTC) @Thriley, Drmies, and Theleekycauldron: Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 06:36, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I mean, I ain't really involved in this, I'm just trying to get y'all talking—but yes, nlh5 is correct that the hook probably wouldn't fly under dyk guidelines. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 06:47, 14 November 2021 (UTC) @Theleekycauldron: Sorry! I think ALT1 is fine. Thriley (talk) 15:43, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Thriley, please see this. More copyedits are necessary. The next sentence has an erroneous comma. And the "first film" in the hook--isn't that actually her fifth or so? Do you mean "feature film" or some such thing? Thank you, Drmies (talk) 17:20, 14 November 2021 (UTC) What about this hook? ALT2 “That in the Pedro Almodóvar film Parallel Mothers, Milena Smit and Penélope Cruz play pregnant women who give birth on the same day?” Thriley (talk) 20:46, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @Theleekycauldron: Is this hook acceptable under the guidelines? Thriley (talk) 20:57, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @Thriley: I'll ping BlueMoonset here in case I'm wrong, but I'm going to say no, it isn't. My reasoning here is that if the hook were read as plaintext, without any bolding or linking, it would be read as pretty much only interesting as it concerns the plot. The hook should concern Smit's life; if it concerns her work as an actress, only stating her role and not anything about production doesn't make the hook out-of-universe. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 21:28, 17 November 2021 (UTC) theleekycauldron, I was taking a look at the ALT1 hook and its sources, and the second Biography sentence is basically copied from Esquire—the Google translate version, at any rate. That's a problem. Another problem is that the source doesn't actually say that she was working as a hotel receptionist when she got the call, just that it was "one of these jobs", referring back to the four in the previous sentence, none of which were hotel receptionist. The article also needs a bit of copyediting. I don't think that either of the plot-based hooks should be used, and as Drmies notes, "first film" is not accurate, since it's Cross the Line that's in the source, which appears to be her fifth film. We could only use "first feature film" if the previous four in her filmography were all short films (which would need to be clearly sourced). Perhaps an angle for the information in ALT1 would be to say she was working in whatever job it was when she was cast in Cross the Line, for which she was nominated as best new actress in the Goya Awards.

Whispyhistory (talk) 06:32, 13 November 2021 (UTC) I don't see that exact sequence of numbers in the source, although there are others that look a bit like an IP address. The trouble is, the nominator seems to be the source for it looking a bit like an IP address, which it does, but we can't use that unless the source makes a similar point, which it does not appear to do. Something like this might work (numbers might need to be changed as mentioned): ALT1 ... that a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone may be described as 88.5.3.2? Philafrenzy (talk) 10:16, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Regarding the image, it's a fun idea but I don't think we run images as quizzes and the image is simply a skeletal foot, and not closely enough related to the hook.

I don't see how the hook you're suggesting is hooky. What exactly is wrong with the hook proposed? It's in the article and it's supported by the sources cited. And the image is directly related to the hook. It engages the reader into a spotting game. Dr. Vogel (talk) 14:57, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Like everyone else, I rather like the IP-address hook. If we wikilinked IP address, it would be supported in the linked articles, and fulfill the requirement that anyone following the links will be able to verify the hook. I don't think we need sourcing that says that a specific sequence of numbers is an IP address, as we have sources giving the general format of an IP address, and creating an example would be a trivial calculation ("Are all four of these numbers separated by periods in the range 0-255?"): "IPv4 and IPv6 address formats". www.ibm.com. An IPv4 address has the following format: x . x . x . x where x is called an octet and must be a decimal value between 0 and 255. Octets are separated by periods. An IPv4 address must contain three periods and four octets. The following examples are valid IPv4 addresses: 1 . 2 . 3 . 4 01 . 102 . 103 . 104 This hook is better than any alternative I can think of, and I don't see anything likely to be problematic about it (it's certainly verifiable). I think we might be in agreement on that? So if some rule technically prohibits it, we might have a good case for applying the WP:Ignore all the rules policy. Broken finger is also currently DYK-eligible and I think it uses the same numbering scheme.[1] HLHJ (talk) 02:07, 14 November 2021 (UTC) [edit: add fulltext url] I don't necessarily agree with the reading of WP:DYKCRIT 3b ( Each fact in the hook must be supported in the article by at least one inline citation to a reliable source [...]) that says that the IP thing needs to be in the article (compare e.g. Template:Did you know nominations/Urine deflector, which similarly took some creative licence in how the proposed hooks were phrased beyond what was stated in either the article or the cited source), and I agree with HLHJ that WP:IAR would be applicable regardless. As for the hooks themselves, writing "a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone may be described as 88.5.3.2" is a much poorer way of writing the hook (less "hooky") than the converse, i.e. "88.5.3.2 may refer to a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone". TompaDompa (talk) 11:28, 14 November 2021 (UTC) This. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 17:01, 16 November 2021 (UTC) We can't use IP address because the nominator just thought it up "oh, that looks like an IP address". It's not in the source as the nominator admits and therefore is not verifiable. And so what if it does look like an IP address? What does that tell us about broken toes? I like clever or quirky hooks and have written many (if I may say so), but they have to be based on something in the sources otherwise it's things made up one day. Philafrenzy (talk) 10:19, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you for all your comments. This is not the place to ignore all rules. The proposed hook is not supported by the source given in the article. I am inclined to approve ALT1 but it needs checking, unless another hook is proposed. Whispyhistory (talk) 15:11, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Oh dear, this has become contentious. I think the contended question is whether it's acceptable to have verified information not found in the nominated article, but only in another article, linked in the hook. Not as hooky, but for illustration: ALT3 ... that the dot-decimal notation string "88.5.3.2" is not only an an IPv4 address, but also a fracture in the middle of the bone at the tip of the little toe? "IPv4 and IPv6 address formats". www.ibm.com., Hallux proximal phalanx fracture in adults: an overlooked diagnosis I don't think we're debating whether the IP-address-hook statement is verifiable. The statement that "88.5.3.2" (and any number in that format) is a valid IPv4 address is supported by the IP address article and the IPv4 article, and this format is the subject of the Dot-decimal notation article. No-one had bothered to cite those statements in those articles, but since they've been challenged here, I've now cited them. So "88.5.3.2 is both an IP address[1] and a code for a broken toebone[2]" is certainly verifiable, and is now verified on Wikipedia. Any DYK reader should have no trouble verifying that the hook is accurate. Alternatives that do not mention IP addressees are not as hooky, but don't contain more information about broken toes: ALT4 ... that "88.5.3.2" is a toe fracture in the middle of the bone at the tip of the little toe, while a "78.5.3.2" is the parallel broken finger?

Your comment higher up about "88.5.3.2" and "ip address" not being in the source is true and I am grateful for your suggested alts. Essentially, the initial and subsequent hooks sound good, but none are in the article or the source. I don't wish for personal comments and don't mind if someone else wishes to take over here. With due respect @DrVogel: and @HLHJ:...You may wish to take this up at Wikipedia talk:Did you know. Whispyhistory (talk) 10:41, 15 November 2021 (UTC) I won't say I wish I hadn't written the article; I hope it's useful enough to make up for the social harm to the project here. I don't think the hostility was intended by anyone; I suspect that it's felt partly due to the ease of mininterpretation in a text-only medium and partly due to human cognitive biases.[2] I certainly did, and do, not intend it. I spent a day's editing trying to resolve the conflict by finding references specifically saying that the two things were in notation X and adding that text to the article, but unfortunately non-inductive descriptions of the notations seem to have been considered so needless that an Internet RFC attempting to formalize them died of disinterest. I did find a source that explicitly defines the IPv4 format, and one that explicitly says that 88.1.2.2 is a specific fracture, and I've cited the latter in the article, but I don't think this helps. It is probably a bit unreasonable to expect a reviewer to do more than apply rules as best they can, and Wikipedia talk:Did you know might indeed be a better forum for a more detailed discussion. I don't really want to take part in one, though (nothing to do with this discussion, prior reasons). I posted because I felt responsible for the conflict and thought I might be able to help. My impression is that I made it worse; my apologies to everyone I've offended. HLHJ (talk) 03:41, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Nobody is offended, but if I may say so I think you are still missing the point. IP addresses have nothing to do with broken toes even if that notation may have a similarity. That's why the sources don't make the comparison and why the IP-based hooks are no good. Any of the other hooks might be fine (I haven't checked the numbers) just without the bit about IP addresses. The whole thing reminds me of unusually shaped vegetables where you may see a carrot shaped like a foot, people who see faces in clouds, and even apophenia. My personal observation that one thing looks a bit like another is not the basis for a hook unless reliable sources make the point too. Philafrenzy (talk) 09:09, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Folks, we are wasting a wonderful hook. Really. IP addresses have nothing to do with broken toes even if that notation may have a similarity and that is the whole point of making good hooks. They are supposed to be short, punchy, catchy, and likely to draw the readers in to wanting to read the article – as long as they don't misstate the article content. And one of the best recipes to make a hook good is to make it sound counterintuitive With any other option but the original, we are bound to receive another hook frequented by maybe a few hundred visitors. I would propose something to the tune of in some contexts, 88.5.3.2 might not mean an IP address but a broken bone in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone? so that no one claims here that we somehow delegitimise the IP address but at the same time so that we preserve the core of the hook. As for the claims that because the hook is not cited in the IP part, it can't be there - please don't be that pedantic. In our today's world of informatics we may assume that people who visit Wikipedia more or less imagine what IP addresses are, and may more or less imagine how they look like (in the worst case they will visit the article for details). The other part is cited. I see no problem with the original. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 17:01, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Szmenderowiecki I admit that I'm not very familiar with the topic, and the above discussion was confusing, but is the "this isn't an IP address" claim actually in the source? Because if it's not, then no matter how good the hook proposal is, it can't be used in a hook since hook facts need to be based on a reference. Also, I'm pretty sure that assumptions don't count as sources. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:31, 17 November 2021 (UTC) What I was leading is that we don't need to cite that the sky is blue, or that we have five fingers; or that there exist IP addresses for that matter. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 11:08, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Given that these IP number hooks aren't working out so far, I wonder if some other hooks unrelated to that could be proposed here.

Nominated by Victuallers (talk) at 16:21, 6 November 2021 (UTC). Article is new enough. Two correct writers are credited. The article is fully referenced. No copyvio detected. There is a bit of biased POV pushing in Wikipedia voice: "most vulnerable to climate change". This will be something our subject is saying no doubt. And this idea is also reflected in the hook with "endangered". The hook content is referenced and confirmed by the Guardian, apart from the "endangered" bit, which opinion is attributed to Tina Stege. So I suggest that "endangered" is taken out of the hook, or it is reworded so it is clear she is saying that. Hook alt1 is unsuitable as it does not link the article and I cannot tell what it is trying to say in relation to the subject. I can confirm image is CC-BY-3.0 as derived from the video with CC-BY-3.0 license.

There is a factual error, as the article states she was interred in Keokuk, Illinois, but the source says she died in Chicago, Illinois and was interred in Keokuk, Iowa. I am assuming good faith for a few references I cannot access (for example, ref 15 - The National Humane Review), which for me gives a landing page for the document, instead of an inside view). Otherwise, everything is properly sourced and there are no copyvio or close paraphrasing concerns (Earwig cites 3 potential problems, but they are not an issue here.) QPQ not required. Regarding the hooks, ALT0 is incorrect as stated, as it reads as if the study was conducted in the early 1900s by Meigs Crowder, whereas she published it in 1917 based on studies from that period. It'll need minor alteration. ALT1 is fine and sourced. I would prefer to promote an amended ALT0. A minor quibble, though not an issue for DYK: please add page numbers for cited sources.

At the time the lawsuit was filed, this was not the case, and in fact the trial judge ruled against Alouche (see last paragraph of background section); it was only after the case was brought to the Court of Appeal for Ontario that the "common employer doctrine" was established, and it became entrenched when leave to appeal the decision at the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed. Mindmatrix 15:11, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Ah, so the idea behind the hook is that, since Downtown Eatery changed the law on common employers, before Downtown Eatery Best Beaver would not have been Alouche's employer? That makes more sense. AleatoryPonderings (???) (!!!) 15:20, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: I'm going to inspect this again... Mindmatrix 15:18, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @AleatoryPonderings: Alright, so to ensure everything is correct, the following timeline occurred: Alouche was hired to be manager at For Your Eyes Only (owned by Grad and Grosman), and began work on 29 December 1992 Alouche was sent a Notice of Discipline in May 1993, and was fired on 15 June 1993 In October 1993, Alouche filed action for wrongful dismissal against Best Beaver Management Inc., as that was the source of his paycheques Best Beaver ceased operations in mid-1996, and all assets distributed to other companies owned by Grad and Grosman The trial resolved in favour of Alouche Best Beaver did not pay out the judgement (all its assets had been redistributed) Sherriffs were dispatched to For Your Eyes Only, where they seized $1,855 Downtown Eatery filed claim against Alouche, stating the cash belonged to it Alouche defended, and counterclaimed against Grad, Grosman, and all companies they controlled on the grounds of common employer doctrine, the oppression remedy of the Ontario Business Corporations Act, and fraudulent conveyance the judge in the second trial (at Ontario Superior Court of Justice) ruled against Alouche the case was brought to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, where the previous ruling was overturned in 2001 in January 2002, an application for leave to appeal the decision at the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed So, the common employer doctrine was part of the second trial as a counterclaim to the suit filed by Downtown Eatery. I just wanted to ensure this satisfies your concerns. Mindmatrix 18:25, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks for this incredibly thorough response. My concern is maybe philosophical or definitional. If I say that company A employs person B, that has an ordinary meaning and a legal meaning. It is probably right that Best Beaver did not employ Alouche in the ordinary sense of "employ", because Best Beaver was a "paymaster" and not the name on the front of the building where he went to work. My reading of the case itself is that, before Downtown Eatery, it was at best indeterminate as a legal matter whether Best Beaver, alone or in combination with its affiliate companies, employed Alouche. After Downtown Eatery, it was established—as a matter of legal meaning, but not necessarily ordinary meaning—that Best Beaver was his employer, or part of his employer, or something like that. The reason I brought this up is that it's not clear how one could verify the claim that "Best Beaver was not Alouche's employer", because that claim might be true as a matter of ordinary meaning but the only authoritative legal ruling we have on this (namely, Downtown Eatery) holds that the claim is false. In any event, I'll leave this to the eventual reviewer to sort out. I find my brain twisting into knots. AleatoryPonderings (???)

Comment (not a review): this specific article, and its creation by proxy for a banned editor, is under discussion at Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard#Gerda Arendt proxying article creation for community-banned user LouisAlain, which has also raised questions about sourcing issues similar to the issues that caused the editor to be banned in the first place. I think the AN discussion needs to come to a conclusion before this can be considered for DYK, and also that any DYK review look very seriously at the sourcing issues (claims of unreliable self-published sources and of sources not verifying the claims they were used to source) discussed at the AN thread. Probably this is going to require that the reviewer be fluent in French. —David Eppstein (talk) 04:15, 8 November 2021 (UTC) I removed LouisAlain from the credits because of concerns, because of me taking full responsibility, and because he never cared about them anyway.

As for the article itself, the article meets DYK requirements, and close paraphrasing was not detected. A QPQ is still pending. My main issue is the hook; frankly, it does not appeal to a broad audience. Duruflé doesn't appear to be a well-known figure (indeed, this pageviews check shows that her English article has had less than 200 total pageviews over the past 30 days, while her French article has only been viewed 5 times during that same period), and given that the hook is dependent on the connection to her, it's just not working here. Looking at the article, unfortunately I couldn't see any information that would work as a broadly-interesting hook, so unless the article is expanded further and new interesting information is added to the article, I can't see this working out on DYK sadly.

Overall: Another good one from Gerda - thank you. Cathedral organists always knock me out, because the cathedral is the pipe organ's soundbox, so they are playing the building - every stone feels it. So this guy deserves an article. The initial question by David Eppstein has now been resolved. All that remains to complete this nom is the QPQ. Storye book (talk) 11:33, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I would not normally contest a review, and I accept that the above review by Narutolovehinata5 gets priority in the normal DYK process. However I don't agree that the number of online hits received by an organ teacher is a judge of their value or ability. If Mme Durufle's pupil Frédéric Blanc has achieved the position of titular organist at Notre Dame, then as I understand it he is the equivalent of a top film star in the movie business. A cathedral organist has great musical power in the building and in the city, and Notre Dame is one of the greatest cathedrals in the world - with good acoustics to boot. Many subjects covered at DYK appeal to a particular audience as opposed to a general one, and that aspect does not disqualify a DYK nomination. That is why DYK hooks cover such a variety of subjects - something for everyone, eh? I don't think the article is unacceptable unless "expanded further and new interesting information is added" - the article is solidly based, and tells us who the subject is, why he is notable, and what he has achieved. Storye book (talk) 11:33, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @Storye book: The issue here is that the Notre Dame mentioned in the hook is not the Notre Dame that most people know (i.e. the one that's currently being rebuilt), but a far less famous one that also happens to be in Paris. Had it been the case that he was the organist for the Notre Dame Cathedral (the famous one), I would have actually approved the hook. The issue here is that the Notre Dame mentioned here is a much more obscure one and not the internationally-famous one (note that Notre Dame is a fairly common name for Catholic churches around the world). As for the fame part, Duruflé's obscurity would have been a non-issue had it been the case that Blanc was the organist of the Notre Dame Cathedral and not the one mentioned in this hook, but given that he was actually the organist of a less well-known church, the hook's interestingness is now reliant on the Duruflé connection, and the connection there doesn't make for a broadly interesting hook in this case. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 11:50, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @Narutolovehinata5: OK, fair enough, I won't argue with that. In that case, what about a new hook about the U.S. masterclasses, in which a mention of some of the university venues should pick up some hits. Taken together, I think his achievements are still interesting and notable. I would very much like to hear his playing of Charles-Marie Widor in the Notre-Dame d'Auteuil - pity we can't put the sound of that in the hook. @Gerda Arendt: Storye book (talk) 12:11, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Honestly I have some reservations on if such hooks are truly interesting to a broad audience, but I'm open to such a hook if there's really nothing else that could be found about him. If such a hook is to be written, I would suggest focusing on Stanford University specifically since that one's probably the most famous among all the universities mentioned in the hook.

You can probably imagine that I didn't invest much time into thoughts about an article endangered from the start. He is exceptional for improvisation, for having published the memoir of Maurice Duruflé, for having published the improvisations of a colleague (at the Cathedral), on top of being organist at the church which has an organ by the same legendary organ builder as the Cathedral. Madame D. is underrated and would profit more from exposure than her famous husband. If we picture the organ, readers should see at a glance that it isn't the Cathedral's.

Please note that Narutolovehinata5 has priority by virtue of posting the first review. But I would like to comment, if I may (re ALT3), that use of Mme Duruflé in a hook would be fine if her article were fine - and it's not, and we have let her down. Her article needs re-writing for neutrality, and it needs citations throughout. The truth of her article is not questioned, and the quality of Mme Duruflé's work is not questioned - but when the article is linked in a hook but is so weakly written, that weakens the reader's respect for her pupil Blanc. So if you want to retain the hook which mentions her, please could you kindly correct her article for neutrality and cite all the paragraphs? Sorry to ask you to do so much when you are so busy, but I think that both she and Blanc are worth the effort. I would attempt it myself, but I cannot speak the required languages, to find and use the right citations. Re ALT2: If we can't have the Mme Duruflé article rescued, then I think ALT2 is a very good hook. I think that people in general don't realise how valuable a reconstruction of improvisation can be. Suppose we lost all recordings of jazz, and only had the basic dots written down? How dull and pointless. Or if we lost all recordings of guitar riffs? But what infuriates me most is the way in which we have lost the Arab inflections and melismas from what we now call plainsong - the empty shell of the improvisation which once existed there. We still have it in sung Islamic prayer, of course, but Europe ignores that (apart from flamenco). So yes, three cheers for Blanc's resurrection of improvisations, and let's hear about it. Just my opinion, which carries no weight, of course.

It is about 3200 bytes, satisfying length criterion. There are small issues with copied phrasing, such as "Elin Festøy was producing a documentary film about the children of lebensborn" which is nearly identical to that of A game about hatred, children and war. This could easily be fixed as "While producing ..." or "During production of...". In fact, the phrasing for the first three sentences in that section needs to be altered, as there is simply too much close paraphrasing. Otherwise, the text is fine and has sources, and all quotations are sourced. Hooks are suitably short and sourced. I do think there are better hooks to be had for this article though, perhaps one focusing on who the lebensborn were or what they experienced (and as it relates to the game, of course). QPQ completed. So, this needs a slight rephrasing for three sentences, and perhaps other ALT hooks to consider.

Freely licensed: Y Used in article: Y Clear at 100px: Y QPQ: Done. Overall: This is a nice article, which is new enough, long enough and well sourced. I am taking the offline sources in good faith. However, I have an issue with the hook which is not directly supported by the source. The source says that the two tribes hunt the bird for bushmeat and decorate their headgear and houses with its feathers and beaks. In another place it just says that "the gizzard of the hornbill was used in some local medicines for curing stomach disorders," but nowhere is this stated as a belief of those two tribes. So it needs to be amended to reflect the source. Alternatively there are some "fascinating facts" at the Oakland Zoo source that could be used, noting that they use a different English name, but the same Latin one. That name, Malayan wreathed hornbill, should perhaps be included in the lede. Also I wonder if the existing alternative name should just be bar-pouched hornbill as per the same website? Bermicourt (talk) 13:57, 11 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks for your feedback, Bermicourt! Re the gizzard : true is that it is not stated in any source that the local people believe .., but only that they use it for curing stomach problems. So I wonder whether the hook should / can be changed to either a) that they use it as medicine, or b) to a different hook altogether, e.g. something about the bird itself : that it flies up to some 25 km from its breeding site in search of favoured fruits, much farther than any other hornbill species. I didn't add this info yet, but can do if you think it worthwhile? Re the name "Malayan wreathed hornbill" : Blanford (1889) seems to have been the first and only one who used this name, but I haven't seen this in any other publication yet. – BhagyaMani (talk) 21:44, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks also to @Casliber: for DYK nominating this page!! – BhagyaMani (talk) 21:44, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, I think this article is worthy of a DYK, but you need to come up with one or two alternative hooks.

Source: 1 and 2 Comment: This is the first time I’ve ever made a DYK here, so here goes. I personally find this fact interesting because it highlights how the advent of YouTube, and internet fame in general, has allowed people to use their voice to reach people in positions of high influence, bringing hidden ideas to light and advocating for change. While this specific example falls under a video game/pop-culture category, and may not fit Wikipedia’s desire for academic material, I feel that this is interesting enough to share, as it’s one the gaming community can relate to, like with other social media trends such as #FreeSmash and "Rerelease Mother 3." As for the article itself, all of the citations should be reliable enough; they’re all from third-party/secondary source outlets and there isn’t any BLP violation to be found here. One concern I have is criteria #3 - “Each fact in the hook must be supported in the article by at least one inline citation to a reliable source, appearing no later than the end of the sentence(s) offering that fact. Citations at the end of the paragraph are not sufficient.” While the hook is sourced in the article, the refs are at the end of the section rather than per each sentence. I can fix that however. Anyway, I hope this fact does get accepted! If not, I understand, thanks for reviewing this anyway. Created/expanded by PantheonRadiance (talk). Self-nominated at 08:45, 17 November 2021 (UTC).

You'd need to have expanded the text content by 5x in length, which I am not seeing in the page history. You'll also need to resolve the many tags for additional citations and expansion in the article. Your best bet would be to get it to good article status and renominate then. See the DYK rules for more details. PS: I removed the image from this nomination, fair use (ie. copyrighted) images are permitted in articles only - Dumelow (talk) 14:35, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Ok that's fine if it can't be nominated and thanks for the suggestion. I'm also wondering what 5x or five fold means like how do I know if an article has been expanded 5 fold. Kaleeb18 (talk) 16:28, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Hi Kaleeb18, no worries and good luck with the article. The expansion is based on the number of characters (ie. letters, spaces etc.) in the article before you started work on it and the number after you've finished. You can use a script like Wikipedia:Did you know/DYKcheck but I just copy the article text into an online character counter (there's loads of websites if you do a Google search for "character counter" or similar) - Dumelow (talk) 16:40, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Oh ok, thanks again.

Article is new enough, very newsworthy event and hence well-sourced, no copyvios (Earwig reports a false positive on the Johnson quotation), QPQ done. However, without a source saying the taxi driver is comfortable to talk about his ear, I'm concerned the hook may not fit the spirit of "Consider very carefully whether the hook puts undue emphasis on a negative aspect of a living individual. Err on the side of caution, and when in doubt, suggest an ALT hook." Could we go with something else? Ritchie333 (talk) (cont) 18:41, 16 November 2021 (UTC) He's a scouser.

The point here is to get this lesser-known heroic guy the DYK, not focus on the scuzzball that started it, you know. I mean, something like Did you know that a bomb has just gone off outside a Liverpool hospital is so anodyne it defeats the object of DYK. People want to hear about this guy, not the perp or the police.

Hi Mike Peel, review follows: article created 16 November; article is well written and the main text is cited to what appear to be reliable sources for the subject; I didn't spot any issues with overly close paraphrasing from a sample of the sources; article exceeds minimum length; a QPQ has been carried out. I have a couple of outstanding queries: The following items from the infobox are not cited there or mentioned in the main text: That "Yuzhmash" was the contractor That it was launched from "Site 32/2" That the launch time was "4:55 UTC" That the manufacturer was "Yuzhnoye" That its intention was "Electronic and Signals Intelligence/ELINT" (mentioned also in the lead) The article and source support that 1,500 fragments were generated (as these are being tracked) but only "likely" that thousands of others were generated. As such I don't think this supports a hook stating plainly that it generated "thousands of pieces of debris". I think an alternative wording ("hundreds" or "at least 1,500") would be needed If you could let me know your thoughts - Dumelow (talk) 08:23, 16 November 2021 (UTC) "Hundreds" or "at least 1500" are both understating the impact, even "thousands" is too low. 1500 objects are large enough to track. Hundreds of thousands of smaller objects are expected, as reported by almost all sources. Somehow the Guardian misreported that as "hundreds". space.com, reuters, BBC, CNN, ... I think we can write hundreds of thousands. That's what the sources report, excluding the Guardian. --mfb (talk) 01:45, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @Dumelow: Thanks for the review, but it seems that this is now linked to in Wikipedia:In the news (wasn't expecting that), which I think makes it ineligible to also be a DYK.

Source: [38] Reviewed: Central Asian Orogenic Belt 5x expanded by Mccunicano (talk). Self-nominated at 00:06, 16 November 2021 (UTC). Newness requirement satisfied by 5x expansion on 11/15 from < 600 to > 3000 characters. Articles also long enough and compliant with core policies on citations and neutrality. The hook is in-line sourced. Photo has appropriate license. QPQ is done. There are, however, two problems: (1) There is some significant overlap with this source. To start, the following sentence is taken from the source without use of quotation marks and with no effort to paraphrase rather than use the precise words: "Local advocacy led to the establishment of Bridle Trails as a state park in 1932." Further, this sentence also strikes me as too closely drawn from the same source: "Initial park development dates to 1933 when Civil Works Administration employees and federal relief workers were employed in state parks as part of the New Deal program. Further work included burning logging debris, clearing brush and building trails and fences." Work needs to be done to put the material into your own words. (2) The hook strikes me as boring in that it states an obvious point. Horses having the right of way on this trail is not unique or special. On trails that are shared by humans and horses, it is the general rule that horses have the right of way. See here ("In general, horses always have the right of way, followed by hikers, then by bikers."). See also here ("For safety reasons, if you come across a horse and rider on any trail they always have right of way. Hikers and bike riders all yield to horses.") To include this on the main page, we really need something that is hooky or interesting about this trail.

For one, the quote is not actually "could have been made by aliens" so, considering this is all about misquotation, we should either use the actual quote or clarify that it is a misquotation. Then "as though it was a real announcement" implies that it was actually, I don't know, a fake announcement? A parody?

Further information: Official supplementary guidelines and unofficial guide  Warning: You are not logged in. Please create an account or log in to proceed. Alternatively, you may leave a message at the bottom of the DYK project talk page with the article you would like to nominate and the hook you would like to propose.  Warning: The helper script only works on desktop. Please switch to desktop view to continue. Install the DYK helper script by adding the line {{subst:lusc|User:SD0001/DYK-helper.js}} to your common.js page. Go back to the article, and choose the "DYK" option from the "More" menu (see image). Fill in the form and submit it. Check back periodically to address comments or concerns from the reviewer (it may take several weeks). Manual instructions[edit] Create a subpage for your new DYK suggestion and then list the page below under the date the article was created or the expansion began or it became a good article (not the date you submit it here), with the newest dates at the bottom. Any registered user may nominate a DYK suggestion (if you are not a registered user, please leave a message at the bottom of the DYK project talk page with the details of the article you would like to nominate and the hook you would like to propose); self-nominations are permitted and encouraged. Thanks for participating and please remember to check back for comments on your nomination (consider watchlisting your nomination page). Read these instructions completely before proceeding. For simplified instructions, see User:Rjanag/Quick DYK 2. I. Create the nomination subpage. Enter the article title in the box below and click the button. (To nominate multiple articles together, enter any or all of the article titles.) You will then be taken to a preloaded nomination page. II. Write the nomination. On the nomination page, fill in the relevant information. See Template:NewDYKnomination and {{NewDYKnomination/guide}} for further information. Not every line of the template needs to be filled in. For instance, if you are not nominating an image to appear with your hook, there is no need to fill in the image-related lines. Add an edit summary e.g. "Nominating YOUR ARTICLE TITLE for DYK" and click Publish page. Make sure the nomination page is on your watchlist, so you can follow the review discussion. III. Post at Template talk:Did you know. In the current nominations section find the subsection for the date on which the article was created or on which expansion began (or, if a new Good Article, the date on which it became a GA), not the date on which you make the nomination. At the top of that subsection (before other nominations already there, but below the section head and hidden comment) add {{Did you know nominations/YOUR ARTICLE TITLE}}. Add an edit summary e.g. "Nominating YOUR ARTICLE TITLE for DYK" and click Publish page. Frequently asked questions[edit] How do I write an interesting hook? Successful hooks tend to have several traits. Most importantly, they share a surprising or intriguing fact. They give readers enough context to understand the hook, but leave enough out to make them want to learn more. They are written for a general audience who has no prior knowledge of or interest in the topic area. Lastly, they are concise, and do not attempt to cover multiple facts or present information about the subject beyond what's needed to understand the hook. When will my nomination be reviewed? This page is often backlogged. As long as your submission is still on the page, it will stay there until an editor reviews it. Since editors are encouraged to review the oldest submissions first, it may take several weeks until your submission is reviewed. In the meantime, please consider reviewing another submission (not your own) to help reduce the backlog (see instructions below). Where is my hook? If you can't find the nomination you submitted to this nominations page, it may have been approved and is on the approved nominations page waiting to be promoted. It could also have been added to one of the prep areas, promoted from prep to a queue, or is on the main page. If the nominated hook is in none of those places, then the nomination has probably been rejected. Such a rejection usually only occurs if it was at least a couple of weeks old and had unresolved issues for which any discussion had gone stale. If you think your nomination was unfairly rejected, you can query this on the DYK discussion page, but as a general rule such nominations will only be restored in exceptional circumstances. Instructions for reviewers[edit] Main page: Wikipedia:Did you know/Reviewing guide Any editor who was not involved in writing/expanding or nominating an article may review it by checking to see that the article meets all the DYK criteria (long enough, new enough, no serious editorial or content issues) and the hook is cited. Editors may also alter the suggested hook to improve it, suggest new hooks, or even lend a hand and make edits to the article to which the hook applies so that the hook is supported and accurate. For a more detailed discussion of the DYK rules and review process see the supplementary guidelines and the WP:Did you know/Reviewing guide. To post a comment or review on a DYK nomination, follow the steps outlined below: Look through this page, Template talk:Did you know, to find a nomination you would like to comment on. Click the "Review or comment" link at the top of the nomination. You will be taken to the nomination subpage. The top of the page includes a list of the DYK criteria. Check the article to ensure it meets all the relevant criteria. To indicate the result of the review (i.e., whether the nomination passes, fails, or needs some minor changes), leave a signed comment on the page. Please begin with one of the 5 review symbols that appear at the top of the edit screen, and then indicate all aspects of the article that you have reviewed; your comment should look something like the following: Article length and age are fine, no copyvio or plagiarism concerns, reliable sources are used. But the hook needs to be shortened. If you are the first person to comment on the nomination, there will be a line :* <!-- REPLACE THIS LINE TO WRITE FIRST COMMENT, KEEPING  :* --> showing you where you should put the comment. Save the page. If there is any problem or concern about a nomination, please consider notifying the nominator by placing {{subst:DYKproblem|Article|header=yes|sig=yes}} on the nominator's talk page. Instructions for project members[edit] How to promote an accepted hook[edit] At-a-glance instructions on how to promote an approved hook to a Prep area See Wikipedia:Did you know/Preparation areas for details on verifying a hook's acceptability. Promoters should not promote their own nomination or their own review When promoting hooks intended for a particular date, keep in mind that when the number of available approved nominations exceeds 120 we switch to two sets per day, and when that number drops below 60 we return to one set per day. Check list for nomination review completeness 1) Select a hook from the approved nominations page that has one of these ticks at the bottom post: . 2) Check to make sure basic review requirements were completed. a. Any outstanding issue following needs to be addressed before promoting. 3) Check the article history for any substantive changes since it was nominated or reviewed. 4) Images for the lead slot must be freely licensed. Fair-use images are not permitted. Images loaded on Commons that appear on the Main Page are automatically protected by KrinkleBot. 5) Hook must be stated in both the article and source (which must be cited at the end of the article sentence where stated). 6) Hook should make sense grammatically. 7) Try to vary subject matters within each prep area. 8) Try to select a funny, quirky or otherwise upbeat hook for the last or bottom hook in the set. Steps to add a hook to prep In one tab, open the nomination page of the hook you want to promote. In a second tab, open the prep set you intend to add the hook to. 1) For hooks held for specific dates, refer to "Local update times" section on DYK Queue. a. Completed Prep area number sets will be promoted by an administrator to corresponding Queue number. 2) Copy and paste the hook into a chosen slot. a. Make sure there's a space between ... and that, and a ? at the end. b. Check that there's a bold link to the article. 3) If it's the lead (first) hook, paste the image where indicated at the top of the template. 4) Copy and paste ALL the credit information (the {{DYKmake}} and {{DYKnom}} templates) at the bottom 5) Check your work in the prep's Preview mode. a. At the bottom under "Credits", to the right of each article should have the link "View nom subpage" ; if not, a subpage parameter will need to be added to the DYKmake. 6) Save the Prep page. Closing the DYK nomination page At the upper left Change {{DYKsubpage to {{subst:DYKsubpage Change |passed= to |passed=yes At the bottom Just above the line containing }}<!--Please do not write below this line or remove this line. Place comments above this line.--> insert a new, separate line containing one of the following: To [[T:DYK/P1|Prep 1]] To [[T:DYK/P2|Prep 2]] To [[T:DYK/P3|Prep 3]] To [[T:DYK/P4|Prep 4]] To [[T:DYK/P5|Prep 5]] To [[T:DYK/P6|Prep 6]] To [[T:DYK/P7|Prep 7]] Also paste the same thing into the edit summary. Check in Preview mode. Make sure everything is against a pale blue background (nothing outside) and there are no stray characters, like }}, at the top or bottom. Save. For more information, please see T:TDYK#How to promote an accepted hook. Handy copy sources: To [[T:DYK/P1|Prep 1]] To [[T:DYK/P2|Prep 2]] To [[T:DYK/P3|Prep 3]] To [[T:DYK/P4|Prep 4]] To [[T:DYK/P5|Prep 5]] To [[T:DYK/P6|Prep 6]] To [[T:DYK/P7|Prep 7]] How to remove a rejected hook[edit] Open the DYK nomination subpage of the hook you would like to remove. (It's best to wait several days after a reviewer has rejected the hook, just in case someone contests or the article undergoes a large change.) In the window where the DYK nomination subpage is open, replace the line {{DYKsubpage with {{subst:DYKsubpage, and replace |passed= with |passed=no. Then save the page. This has the effect of wrapping up the discussion on the DYK nomination subpage in a blue archive box and stating that the nomination was unsuccessful, as well as adding the nomination to a category for archival purposes. How to remove a hook from the prep areas or queue[edit] Edit the prep area or queue where the hook is and remove the hook and the credits associated with it. Go to the hook's nomination subpage (there should have been a link to it in the credits section). View the edit history for that page Go back to the last version before the edit where the hook was promoted, and revert to that version to make the nomination active again. Add a new icon on the nomination subpage to cancel the previous tick and leave a comment after it explaining that the hook was removed from the prep area or queue, and why, so that later reviewers are aware of this issue. Add a transclusion of the template back to this page so that reviewers can see it. It goes under the date that it was first created/expanded/listed as a GA. You may need to add back the day header for that date if it had been removed from this page. If you removed the hook from a queue, it is best to either replace it with another hook from one of the prep areas, or to leave a message at WT:DYK asking someone else to do so. How to move a nomination subpage to a new name[edit] Don't; it should not ever be necessary, and will break some links which will later need to be repaired. Even if you change the title of the article, you don't need to move the nomination page. Nominations[edit] Older nominations[edit] Articles created/expanded on September 2[edit] Inger K.

Self-nominated at 14:12, 2 September 2021 (UTC). SportsOlympic has been blocked for sockpuppetry. Created by Cavalryman (talk) General: Article is new enough and long enough New Enough: Y Long Enough: Y Policy compliance: Adequate sourcing: N - Several problems here: Sources: "Olympedia – Inger K. Frith". www.olympedia.org. – this source is of questionable reliability. MRS. INGER FRITH, Olympic Review, 1971 – the link doesn’t work for me and there is inadequate bibliographic information for me to verify what it is. "Danish WW2 Pilots | Inger Kristine Frith (née Pragholm) (1909 - 1981)". www.danishww2pilots.dk. – I am satisfied a website run by Mikkel Plannthin about WWII Danish pilots is generally reliable (he has been published writing about this subject matter) but ... this seems to have been written largely from information gained in this forum thread and there is a big disclaimer at the bottom of this article raising some very significant discrepancies within the entry, which are included as fact in the article. Particularly the rank of Captain which never existed in the WAAF. I feel this raises questions about the reliability of the source. "Inger Frith blazed a trail for women in sports governance". www.insidethegames.biz. March 5, 2021. – looks reliable to me. The third paragraph in the WWII section is uncited. Filling more parameters in Template:Cite web, particularly authorship, would go a long way to presentation. Neutral: Y Free of copyright violations, plagiarism, and close paraphrasing: Y Other problems: N - The article misattributes several statements: likely the highest ranked Danish woman in service during the Second World War – the cited source states that she was the highest ranked that the author is aware of. She became a volunteer in the army in Cape Town and was later accepted for the Air Force – the cited source makes no mention of the Army. Hook eligibility: Cited: N - cites two sources with issues as described above Interesting: Y Other problems: N - perhaps base the hook on excellent insidethegames.biz article, something like “ that after serving in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War, Inger K. Frith became the first woman to lead a major international sporting federation and returned archery to the Olympics?” I have added it as a possible alternate above but am happy to play with it. QPQ: N - Not done Overall: I apologise if I seem to have been very harsh and I could be being very finicky, but the article is very clunky to read, with short little sentences and paragraphs that I feel don’t flow very well. Further, there is no such thing as the “British Air Force”, it is the United Kingdom’s air force or the Royal Air Force. Earwig shows 13.8% match to the Plannthin webpage, but I don’t think it breaches the COPYVIO threshold. Also QPQ is required. Cavalryman (talk) 04:08, 3 September 2021 (UTC). Hello @SportsOlympic: this nomination has been sitting here for almost a week and I can see you have not edited the article, nor have you supplied a QPQ. Are you still interested in pursuing the nomination? Cavalryman (talk) 12:56, 9 September 2021 (UTC). Olympedia are the same people as Sports Reference and is states at WP:Sports as reliable. It’s a pitty you can’t open the second source, is has great and reliable content. So the main issue is that it stated that she was Captain and the naming of the British Air Force? I’m not native English, so I can’t write it in high class English. As that is a problem, I can’t improve it to your satisfactions. I will rename the Air Force name and title of Captain because that might me wrong. Next to that, I don’t like your other option: it not mentioned she had a high rank and she was the first female at an sports federation SportsOlympic (talk) 20:24, 9 September 2021 (UTC) I can find no such reference at WP:Sports but perhaps I am missing something, there has only been one discussion at the reliable source noticeboard WP:Reliable sources/Noticeboard/Archive 335#Olympedia, that being said it is not used to cite anything controversial. Whilst you have made a couple of small fixes, you missed some of the nuance in my comments above particularly those points listed in green. Further, the claim in the hook to be high ranked depends upon if the rank of Captain (which is clearly wrong) is supposed to be an Army or a Navy Captain, a Captain in the Army is not high ranked, Navy is getting up there. As it stands I feel this article is not at the standard required to be featured on the main page, but I am happy for others to take a look at it. Cavalryman (talk) 22:38, 9 September 2021 (UTC). I have not looked at the article but would like to confirm that Olympedia is an authoritative source for Olympic bios. Schwede66 18:15, 13 September 2021 (UTC) Schwede66, many thanks, honestly Olympedia is the least of the issues here. Kind regards, Cavalryman (talk) 22:39, 13 September 2021 (UTC). It has been over a week and the nominator has made very little effort to rectify many of the issues raised above, nor have they supplied a QPQ (I was considering donating a QPQ if issues were rectified). They have received a TP notification [1] and been pinged above, so unfortunately I think this should be marked as ineligible and closed. Cavalryman (talk) 00:44, 17 September 2021 (UTC). Hi Cavalryman, I've done considerable cleanup work on the article, finding published sources for a good bit of the material, and rewriting some parts based on the additions. This one should get a whole new review. Mary Mark Ockerbloom (talk) 06:40, 17 September 2021 (UTC) It might need a new hook too: ALT4:... that after serving as a meteorological officer in the Second World War, Inger K.

Extremely awkward, and leading with Captain gives the impression that she was subsequently demoted to Second Lieutenant in the following paragraph. - reworded She and her husband eventually settled in Crowthorne. Sticks out like a sore thumb, maybe move it into the later life section, as in "died in Crowthorne where she and Ronald had established their home."REMOVED In 1985, she was credited as "the main architect of archery's reintroduction to the Olympic programme in 1972." This quote needs in-text attribution. DONE It's getting closer, with some of the issues raised in the first review have still not been resolved, and care needs to taken to ensure the correct source is used to cite certain pieces of information. I have struck ALT0 because we have now clarified that she was not "a high ranked pilot during World War II". Cavalryman (talk) 04:03, 20 September 2021 (UTC). I have also struck my first ALT1 as she did not serve in the RAF but instead served in the SAAF, so have added ALT2, with no preference between it and ALT4. Cavalryman (talk) 00:48, 21 September 2021 (UTC). ALT numbers amended to reflect added ALT3 above. Cavalryman (talk) 21:46, 5 October 2021 (UTC). Unfortunately, Cavalryman, there were two hooks labeled ALT3. I renamed the second one "ALT4", but you should specify whether you were referring to the first ALT3 or the one now called ALT4. MANdARAX • XA?Ab?AM 21:08, 5 October 2021 (UTC) @Mandarax: yes I can see the second ALT3 was added here, I have amended my comment accordingly. Kind regards, Cavalryman (talk) 21:46, 5 October 2021 (UTC). I have copy-edited the article. She served in both the Women's RAF and the SAAF, but I am not sure that the article needs to be held up over debates about her wartime service. I have proposed an alternative that just focuses on her role in sports. The article is worth including in DYK, so I am happy to step in a help get it finished. The sources seem credible to me. Are there other issues left? PMCH2 (talk) 22:46, 26 September 2021 (UTC) Respectfully, not all of the issues raised in the above review have been addressed. Further, then sent to Cairo where she transferred from the SAAF to Great Britain's Women's Royal Air Force, receiving a commission contradicts the preceding paragraph that says she served ... in the South African Air Force (SAAF) from 23 October 1941 to 21 July 1945 and the fact that to have been a Second Lieutenant she must already have been a commissioned officer. Cavalryman (talk) 12:49, 27 September 2021 (UTC). I have added archive links for sources that don't have authors. I removed the one link that didn't work. Others have appropriate details. I have replied above to the concerns I have addressed. I removed the phrase about the commission. I have done my best to address all the issues. PMCH2 (talk) 03:26, 3 October 2021 (UTC) @PMCH2: when I get a chance I will have another detailed look. At a cursory glance, there is still plenty of room to add more bibliographic information to the citations, for instance the www.danishww2pilots.dk source should be: Plannthin, Mikkel (12 September 2010). "Inger Kristine Frith (née Pragholm)". Danish WW2 Pilots. Archived from the original on 31 August 2021. Retrieved 29 August 2021. I will look at the rest soon. Also, a QPQ still has not been provided. Cavalryman (talk) 21:59, 5 October 2021 (UTC). I haven't seen a DYK be scrutinized this closely before in regards to citations. I stepped in to try to help, but it's not my article, and I have spent as much time as I can. You seem to have a very high bar. I don't have a DYK credit to donate. 22:57, 7 October 2021 (UTC) I am sorry you think I am being overly harsh, but I think it is plain sloppy not including proper attribution, and the with the example above I think the fact that the same author is responsible for two cited sources is relevant. I initially reviewed the article because I thought the subject was interesting and worthy of some time in the main page sun. But I too have found it frustrating, I have conducted two complete reviews and even then my findings have not been acted upon, and further still there has been a stunningly consistent lack of attention to detail. I will now do some editing of the article to bring it up to a standard I believe is required. Cavalryman (talk) 01:28, 8 October 2021 (UTC). Thanks for your edits on the article. It reads better and I can see you have cleaned up the sources. I will do a QPQ this weekend, so we can get this over the line.PMCH2 (talk) 12:41, 10 October 2021 (UTC) Many thanks. If you cannot I will try to do one. I also intend to email World Archery to see if we can get a photo. Regards, Cavalryman (talk) 13:13, 10 October 2021 (UTC). I have reviewed Kennin Rebellion for DYK. Thanks for chasing down a photo - that would be great.PMCH2 (talk) 14:03, 12 October 2021 (UTC) Many thanks. Re photo I have been had correspondence with World Archery and they have said we can use the 1961 photo in this article, I am just trying to get them to confirm what license they are happy to release it under. Given I am now responsible for over 70% of the text [2], should a fresh reviewer have a look at this? Cavalryman (talk) 22:10, 12 October 2021 (UTC). After some initial positive correspondence World Archery not responded about licenses for almost a week. I will send one more email but am not holding my breath that a photo will be released. Cavalryman (talk) 22:29, 17 October 2021 (UTC). yeah, I think we're going to need a new reviewer on this one. Cavalryman, given your contributions to getting this article to DYK, I've added you to the credits section. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 20:04, 18 October 2021 (UTC) As best I can tell, the major issues concerning sourcing and attribution have been addressed, and this article seems ready for the main page. Thanks to everyone who contributed to make this work. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 04:54, 20 October 2021 (UTC) @Theleekycauldron: if a photo is released I will ping you to see if you are happy for it to be added to the nomination. Kind regards, Cavalryman (talk) 05:09, 20 October 2021 (UTC). Re photo ... the person I have been corresponding with at World Archery needs to return to the office to confirm their ownership status of this picture, due to covid that cannot occur before 4th November. I request this be held off until then. Cavalryman (talk) 09:50, 20 October 2021 (UTC). @Cavalryman: happy to wait. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 20:23, 21 October 2021 (UTC) Any updates on the image? If we waiting just for the image, I'll suggest to let this nomination run without an image. – Kavyansh.Singh (talk) 08:03, 30 October 2021 (UTC) As said above I do not expect any word before the 4th of November. If there is a chronic shortage of articles for DYK then by all means run this, but it would be a shame to potentially deny this most capable woman a face when she is featured for the sake of a week. Cavalryman (talk) 10:08, 31 October 2021 (UTC). There is no shortage of hooks on DYK. I was just concerned about how backlogged this particular nomination is. If it is worth waiting for the image, no issues then. – Kavyansh.Singh (talk) 10:19, 31 October 2021 (UTC) I have just received this in an email from World Archery: I checked last Thursday in our old history books, but there is no mention of photographer there. However, I'm on another track that was given to me by the author of another book on the history of our federation, but I'll have to check it out this Thursday when I'm again in the office. Things are in progress, and I should be able to give you some good news by next week! If everyone is happy to wait a few more days hopefully we’ll have a photo. Cavalryman (talk) 08:07, 8 November 2021 (UTC). @Cavalryman: Any updates? I think this should get promoted within a week if an image doesn't materialize. Side note to @BlueMoonset: original nom has been blocked for socking, do they still get a credit? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 05:13, 17 November 2021 (UTC) theleekycauldron, I'm trying to remember. Why don't you ask at WT:DYK and see whether there are any recollections about past cases, or strong opinions either way. Sorry I can't be more definitive. On the matter of promoting, the nomination will be three months old on December 2, and should have been promoted prior to then. BlueMoonset (talk) 05:30, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I see Wikipedia talk:Did you know/Archive 152#Multiple DYK nominations in process by newly checkuser-blocked sockpuppet: how to proceed?, which ended up with every nom made by the sock being rejected. Since this one's been adopted, We shouldn't close this nom, it's been adopted, but I am striking their credit. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 05:46, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Apologies, I was going to give an update this morning (Australian time). I had an email overnight from World Archery wanting to clarify the process of uploading a picture, I wouldn’t mind betting there will be an email with photo attached in the inbox at permissions@wikimedia.org tomorrow Swiss time. I agree, if there is no image within a week promote it, this has been a lengthy process. Cavalryman (talk) 06:03, 17 November 2021 (UTC). Articles created/expanded on September 24[edit] Economy of Sarawak ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that the economy of Sarawak is strongly dependent on natural resource exports such as timber, oil, and gas? [1] ALT1:... that Sarawak has the third-largest economy in Malaysia? [2] ALT2:... that the economy of Sarawak was stagnant during the rule of the first White Rajah? [3] ALT3:... that Sarawak was the world's largest exporter of tropical timber in the 1980s, contributing greatly to the state's economy at the time?[4] Created/expanded by Cerevisae (talk). Self-nominated at 08:59, 29 September 2021 (UTC). The article needs copyediting first. In addition, the table in the article is mostly empty. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 11:42, 12 October 2021 (UTC) Thanks for your suggestion. Table moved to sandbox for further expansion. Cerevisae (talk) 13:35, 17 October 2021 (UTC) @Narutolovehinata5: I have carried out some copyedits, let me know if there are areas that need another run-through. CMD (talk) 07:59, 24 October 2021 (UTC) Apologies for the late reply! Anyway, ALT0 is probably the best hook among the three proposed (ALT1 seems unimpressive to me while ALT2 may need additional context). However, the sentence verifying ALT0 doesn't have a footnote; instead, the references for it are spread across other nearby sentences instead, duplication is needed here for DYK purposes. In addition, it may be a good idea to propose an additional hook about Sarawak being the biggest timber exporter in the 1980s since that fact seems more interesting than the others discussed here. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 06:53, 1 November 2021 (UTC) added ALT 3. Cerevisae (talk) 04:30, 5 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you for the proposal; however, I feel that it may not meet WP:EGG. Would it be possible to rewrite ALT3 to make the link to "Economy of Sarawak" clearer? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 06:52, 5 November 2021 (UTC) talk, ALT 3 changed. Cerevisae (talk) 14:23, 8 November 2021 (UTC) ALT3 reads better, but it may still need to be copyedited for grammar. In addition it lacks a bold link to the DYK article subject. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:29, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Hook copyedited. CMD (talk) 07:03, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you for the edits. Now the article was new enough and long enough at the time of the nomination and no close paraphrasing was found. However, there are still a number of outstanding issues. Firstly, the sentence that mentions the main hook fact is lacking a footnote, with the relevant reference instead coming at the end of the paragraph where the fact is located at; duplication is necessary here per DYK rules. Secondly, the article doesn't say that the timber industry contributed "greatly" to Sarawak's economy: I would suggest deleting the word "greatly" from the hook, with the rest of that part being accepted as it's implied by the rest of the article. Thirdly, a QPQ has yet to be provided; this was the nominator's sixth nomination, so a QPQ should have been provided at the time of the nomination or within a week of then.

Source: Wells (2003), The Battle That Stopped Rome, pp. 206–7 Improved to Good Article status by SpartaN (talk). Self-nominated at 03:34, 29 September 2021 (UTC). General eligibility: New Enough: Y Long Enough: Y Other problems: Y Policy compliance: Adequate sourcing: Y Neutral: Y Free of copyright violations, plagiarism, and close paraphrasing: Y Other problems: Y Hook eligibility: Cited: N - Source is offline but happy to AGF. However, in the article the statement “they considered German lands too poor for annexation” is sourced to p.204 of Wells. pp.206-7 referred to above is used to support that they that “it was too costly in economic and military resources” to go into in Germany. I guess either way the hook is sourced but could you clarify the exact sourcing of the hook. Interesting: Y QPQ: None required. Overall: Interesting thorough article, well-written with good quality sourcing. Earwig shows no issues. Just a minor query around the hook sourcing but otherwise will be good to go. DeCausa (talk) 08:23, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @DeCausa: I found the web link that (for me) shows a preview if you're able to see it: https://books.google.com/books?id=mc30CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA206&lpg=PA206 SpartaN (talk) 10:07, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @SpartaN: Thanks for providing the link. It’s prompted a couple of thoughts for me. Firstly, Wells doesn’t seem to be saying the reason for the withdrawal is definitively known (“… the reasons for these decisions must have lain…”) i.e he’s making an assumption, however well founded. The hook is more definite than Wells is. Secondly, Wells’ emphasis is on the strength of the resistance being behind the reason - the poor value of the territory makes it “not worth it” because of the strength of the resistance. That’s not quite the same as just saying the land wasn’t valuable. (I notice the text you used in the article on this reflects that effort/value ratio issue.) To fix both points would you be prepared to consider an ALT1 which after “…Teutoburg” continues something along the lines of “…likely decided to leave Germany because the military effort was out of proportion to the territory’s value?” although there may need to be some trimming to get it into the 200 character limit. DeCausa (talk) 11:12, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @SpartaN and DeCausa: It's been over a month since the last comments here, have there been any updates? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:31, 13 November 2021 (UTC) From my point of view I’m waiting for SpartaN’s reply to my last post here. But I notice they haven’t edited Wikipedia since then, over a month ago. So I’m not quite sure what can be done. DeCausa (talk) 08:17, 13 November 2021 (UTC) I see. Given that there's really only one issue holding the nomination back, would anyone be willing to adopt this in case SpartaN doesn't return? It would be a shame if the nomination failed at this point. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 06:35, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I’m not sure what exactly are the DYK rules on this but, subject to that, options could be (a) I propose an ALT1 hook and someone else signs it off; (b) someone else proposes an ALT1 hook and I sign it off; (c) if anyone disagrees with me on the original hook I’m happy to step away and they sign it off. DeCausa (talk) 11:04, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I've looked at the Wells source and concur that it is saying the withdrawal was more down to the ratio of effort required to potential reward, and have boldly tweaked the copy in the article to reflect this. For what it's worth, I think ALT1 works just fine. firefly ( t · c ) 11:16, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Ok. I’m just going to formalize the ALT1 and let someone else add the tick and sign off: ALT1:... that the Romans won a series of campaigns against the Germanic tribes after the disaster at Teutoburg but likely decided to leave Germany as the effort was out of proportion to the territory’s value? DeCausa (talk) 12:07, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Since the reviewer has proposed a new hook, another editor will be needed to sign this off. I'm not sure though if the section linking in the bold links is allowed, however. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:29, 15 November 2021 (UTC) sorry, I missed that. It’s not even necessary to link to a section of the article so I’ve taken it out of ALT1.

Self-nominated at 11:39, 5 October 2021 (UTC). – The article is long enough (16,688 characters) and new enough (created on October 4, 2021). It cites various sources, and Earwig's Copyvio detector shows 29.1% similarity (violation unlikely). But ... It has few neutrality issues including a neutrality tag. The hook seems fine, and maybe cited in the article. Can we have a source here? Rest, a QPQ has been done. Till the neutrality concerns are resolved, this DYK nomination should be on hold. – Kavyansh.Singh (talk) 06:57, 20 October 2021 (UTC) Kavyansh.Singh I rewrote the disputed section based on more reliable sources. Unfortunately, it was reverted immediately by ?Khirurg who appears to think that the New York Times is not a reliable source. Perhaps they would explain here why they object. (t · c) buidhe 03:05, 24 October 2021 (UTC) Yeah you rewrote it alright - by removing a whole bunch of sources. Maybe you can explain why AP is not reliable source? Perhaps you can also explain why you removed the POV tag, even though your edit did not address any of the issues raised in the talkpage? Khirurg (talk) 03:07, 24 October 2021 (UTC) Khirurg : Hi, I don't think the AP source supports the content it's cited for. The AP source reports that Greece has made certain accusations, it doesn't say whether they are correct or not. I'm not sure how Greek accusations against Turkey (regardless of whether they are correct or not) have any bearing about this article, which is about Greece. Cleanup tags should be removed unless there is active discussion ongoing and the person placing it can substantiate that there is a problem with the article. (t · c) buidhe 03:14, 24 October 2021 (UTC) Not only you removed AP news, you also removed the Brussels International Center. Your edits made the article even more POV, by trying to spin away the hostile actions of the Turkish government. And it's not a "cleanup tag", it's POV tag, and there is very much an active discussion going on, first of all right here. If you are avoiding the article talkpage and spin that "no discussion ongoing", that's not going to work. Khirurg (talk) 03:23, 24 October 2021 (UTC) Khirurg Actually I have no opinion on the reliability of BIC at this point, but I hesitate to cite think tanks when there are better sources available (I cited the New York Times, Verfassungsblog and an academic paper, all of which are higher quality than a think tank). I checked several sources and all of them mention that the main change in February-March 2020 was opening the border to migrants, some also mention that Turkey bussed migrants to the border or that at least one incident of coercing migrants was reported. Your wording suggests that all or many migrants since then were coerced to travel to Greece. This is misleading because few if any reliable sources support coercive "push" tactics being a widespread or systematic practice by Turkey at its border with Greece. (t · c) buidhe 04:02, 24 October 2021 (UTC) Not only is BIC itself a perfectly reliable source (much more so than the partisan NGOs you have filled the article with), but it's really not hard to find sources about the Turkish government coercing migrants to the border [3]. This assume of course that one in inclined to look for sources, instead of pretending they don't exist. And here [4] (and then doubled down [5], you seem to have followed me to a Requested Move I recently participated in, in what appears to be clear WP:HOUND behavior. So everyone can see what's going on here. Khirurg (talk) 00:47, 25 October 2021 (UTC) Okay, coming back to the DYK criteria, this seems to meet everything except the neutrality issues. I see that there has been no active discussion on the talk page form at-least 17 days. @Buidhe Any updates on @Khirurg's concerns? I can' formally approve this until the neutrality concerns are resolved. – Kavyansh.Singh (talk) 16:28, 25 October 2021 (UTC) @Kavyansh.Singh, Buidhe, and Khirurg: this nomination should probably be closed if the neutrality concerns are not resolved one way or another. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 01:21, 10 November 2021 (UTC) Great, now you can filibuster DYKs you don't like by raising spurious "concerns" and inserting loaded language. (t · c) buidhe 01:34, 10 November 2021 (UTC) What "loaded language"? I raised my concerns in the talkpage, and you've done nothing but edit-war since then. Khirurg (talk) 01:54, 10 November 2021 (UTC) The most egregiously loaded language I recall was a human rights violation that encapsulates a will to eliminate a person’s presence on the face of the planet, which was added by you. Khirurg (talk) 02:02, 10 November 2021 (UTC) You insist on inserting loaded language like "Weaponization of migration" and "coercive engineered migration" which simply do not reflect the majority reliable sources (and are only tangentially related to the article topic, because they are accusations against Turkey rather than Greece) as explained above. I explained that you have misrepresented sources as seen above, and substituted opinion pieces for news coverage and peer-reviewed academic papers, and all you do is revert. So it's unclear to me how any progress can be made here. (t · c) buidhe 02:07, 10 November 2021 (UTC) Everything I have added is sourced to reliable sources. As far as opinion pieces, you're the one that has added those, such as this opinion piece written by grad students [6]. You haven't made the slightest effort to meet me halfway, instead you just blanket-revert all my additions claiming "my sources are better than yours". No attempt at dispute resolution, just blanket reverts like this [7]. The article is mainly based on activist NGO sources. Yes, there can be no progress under these conditions. Khirurg (talk) 02:45, 10 November 2021 (UTC) You literally replaced a news article from the New York Times and academic paper with an opinion piece from The Hill regarding the March 2020 escalation in order to replace fact-based description with loaded language of "weaponization". I did not cite any opinion pieces in the article, and it's a lie to say that the article is "mainly based on activist NGO sources". (t · c) buidhe 03:37, 10 November 2021 (UTC) (Personal attack removed). I just linked to an opinion piece you put in the article in my previous post. InfoMigrants, Mare Liberum, Aegean Boat Report are all activist NGOs used as references (to name just a few). The only way to resolve this is through some form of third party mediation. Would you be agreeable to something like that, yes or no? Khirurg (talk) 04:01, 10 November 2021 (UTC) That's simply untrue, InfoMigrants is a journalism outfit based on a media partnership, not a NGO let alone an "activist" one, and the EJIL Talk piece is expert analysis, not from their editorial section. As for third party mediation, sure why not? But I can't see the use in repeating points that were ignored the first time. (t · c) buidhe 12:11, 10 November 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: imho, the best way to break a filibuster is the old fashioned way: cloture motion. I'd recommend that you get as many eyes on this as possible, see if a clearer consensus falls out. my confidence in either of you conceding your point is dwindling, so this back-and-forth seems unhelpful, as you both pointed out. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 08:52, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Articles created/expanded on October 9[edit] Pankratius Pfeiffer ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that Salvatorian priest Pankratius Pfeiffer saved hundreds of Jews in Rome during the Second World War? Reviewed: 1936 Northeast Flood Created by Ergo Sum (talk). Self-nominated at 17:52, 9 October 2021 (UTC). New article that was created on 9 October 2021? is 3,212 characters and nominated on the same day. No copyvios detected and duplication detector of [8][9][10][11][12] reveal no close paraphrasing issues (AGF PDF docs which can't go through Dup detector). Article is well-sourced. Hook is 103 characters long (under 200 character max.) and is interesting. Refs 4 and 5 (verifying the hook) are reliable sources. QPQ done. Looks good to go! —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:41, 9 October 2021 (UTC) Too many red flags here. If he really saved hundreds of Jews, you would expect plenty of confirmation of this in scholarly sources and him to be recognized by Yad Vashem. I can't count the number of times that I've seen mainstream newspapers print completely false stories about Jews being rescued during the holocaust, so better sources are definitely needed to confirm these extraordinary claims. Thanks Brigade Piron for letting me know about this. (t · c) buidhe 16:51, 10 October 2021 (UTC) I have to admit I'm just a bit perplexed by the argument. Except in fairly uncommon cases of multiple RS that contradict each other, we don't generally recognize any "hierarchy" of reliable sources. Sources are either RS or they are not. So I'm not sure what kind of sources you have in mind as "better" sources. The ones currently cited in the article are all RS, so that should be the end of it. I might add that if you seek some manner of official imprimatur in the vein of Yad Vashem, the City of Rome named a street after him. Your point about why there isn't more extensive coverage of this historical figure is well taken but can easily be attributed to the fact that all manner of historical figures are lost to history, especially those who are notable really for one major event in their life that did not come to light until years later, as is the case here. Indeed, one of the RS in this article describes Pfeiffer as being "lost to history." I'm adding the new review icon here so that we can get at least one more editor's evaluation of this. Ergo Sum 13:32, 16 October 2021 (UTC) There are very few people who actually saved hundreds of Jews during the Holocaust and plenty of hoaxes that were reported as truth by various news organizations—for example Necdet Kent. In other cases, actual rescue did occur but the numbers are greatly exaggerated and repeated uncritically by news organizations, such as Raoul Wallenberg. If the story is true you would expect to see it covered in many more credible sources. There are plenty of cases where a source is reliable for some info but not others. For example, someone's CV is often reliable for "they worked at X organization" but not "they are a world expert in Z". Extraordinary claims require extraordinary sourcing. (t · c) buidhe 21:27, 16 October 2021 (UTC) I should say that I share Buidhe's concerns. I think saying that "all manner of historical figures are lost to history" rather side-steps the sheer volume of historical scholarship on all aspects of the Holocaust. On a more banal note, I think part of the problem is that the sources cited are, essentially, all journalistic sources published by explicitly Catholic or Salvatorian outlets. The specific sources cited for the "saved" claim are Romereports (I am not familiar with this outlet, but the typo in the video does not inspire confidence) and a self-published Salvatorian newsletter. Neither are scholarly sources and both are, again, explicitly confessional in nature. I think WP:BIASED may on point in a highly sensitive issue touching on the wider disputes about Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust. Do we know what the Samerski book says, for example? —Brigade Piron (talk) 08:55, 17 October 2021 (UTC) Buidhe It is true that the sources cover Catholic issues, but only the Salvatorian one is actually published by a Catholic institution. I need not go into how varied Catholic newspapers are in their adherence/faithfulness to the Catholic hierarchy and beliefs (see e.g. National Catholic Reporter versus National Catholic Register). But more direclty, there actually are many scholarly RS that discussion Pfeiffer and his works in Nazi-occupied Rome. You will find them on the other language versions of this article. The problem is that I do not read Italian or German well enough to use them in the article. Coverage is not the issue. It is English language coverage. Ergo Sum 13:48, 17 October 2021 (UTC) @Ergo Sum: perhaps add the word "reportedly" before "saved". I'm inclined to accept in good faith the sources used as reliable – none of them have not been deprecated nor deemed generally unreliable. —Bloom6132 (talk) 16:41, 26 October 2021 (UTC) DYK should not cover unconfirmed reports or rumors so I strongly disagree with that suggestion. As well as assuming sources are reliable if they've never been discussed at WP:RSN, which disregards important parts of WP:RS such as WP:CONTEXTMATTERS. There is no issue with citing sources in Italian or German, but if it's not confirmed that they support the content then it's incorrect to assume that they do. (t · c) buidhe 20:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Bloom6132: I tend to think that statements are either supported by RS and written in wikivoice or they're not accepted at all. For that reason, I shy away from words like "reportedly." I reiterate though that I think it's quite clear there's nothing wrong with the sources currently used. They're all RS, so that should be the end of it. Hence, why I think your initial review was satisfactory. Ergo Sum 23:40, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Ergo Sum: agreed. I'm still of the view that the hook satisfies criteria 3b. Criteria 4 states that "Nominations should be rejected if an inspection reveals that they are not based on reliable sources". That is not the case here. —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) You're still ignoring the principle in RS that context matters, and some sources are reliable for some but not other info. The two of us who actually write on Holocaust related topics have expressed that the sources cited are not reliable for the exceptional claims being made. (t · c) buidhe 23:59, 26 October 2021 (UTC) With all due respect, I am of the opinion that the sources used are reliable for the info in the hook. The fact that you and Brigade Piron write on Holocaust-related topics is irrelevant – it does not confer a veto over hooks pertaining to that subject. By that logic, I should be able to veto baseball or heraldry hooks ... —Bloom6132 (talk) 01:10, 27 October 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: Three of my DYKs promoted (including Coat of arms of the Falkland Islands from August this year) have included the word "reportedly" in the hook, as well as numerous hooks from other editors. Disagree all you want – this is accepted practice at DYK. —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: I'm aware that you have experience writing about Holocaust-related articles and I put value in your assessment as a solid editor. However, I'm quite comfortable in my ability to vet RS, as well, and my confidence in these sources means I must disagree with your opinion here. Experienced editors do disagree at times, and it is my opinion that I think you have gotten this one wrong; doubtless, you think the same for me. I haven't seen any evidence that these are not RS. Therefore, I recommend if Bloom6132 is inclined to do so, to renew their approval of the hook. In the meantime, I'm going to request the input of additional experienced editors on the DYK talk page. Ergo Sum 01:28, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm going to ping @Bamse, Bermicourt, Jmabel, and Anyfile to see if we can find some reliable sources in other languages. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 01:46, 27 October 2021 (UTC) Oops, @AnyFile theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 01:47, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm currently traveling & very busy, so not much help here, I'm afraid. - Jmabel | Talk 01:53, 27 October 2021 (UTC) That said, more or less this same case is made in The Pope's Jews: The Vatican's Secret Plan to Save Jews from the Nazis by Gordon Thomas (not currently cited in the article). - Jmabel | Talk 02:00, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm unclear as to why the cited sources are unreliable: are we assuming that all information emanating from a Roman Catholic source is unreliable? If so what's the logic? In any case there are dozens of book sources in English, German, French and Italian that mention Pfeiffer, the problem is that few are accessible online. One is an entire biography of Pfeiffer "from baker to Vatican diplomat" which would be useful to track down: Willer, Philomena (2005). P. Pankratius Pfeiffer SDS: (1872-1945); vom Bäckergesellen zum Vatikandiplomat. Pub: Josef Fink. Others that mentions Pfeiffer and the Jews in Rome are: Liebhart (1996) Schwangau. Meding (1992), Flucht vor Nürnberg. Sinn (1976), Illegal. Bermicourt (talk) 08:41, 27 October 2021 (UTC) My issue is with the unreliability of journalistic works and popular history, which have in many cases published inaccurate information about rescues of Jews during the Holocaust. If better sources exist, they should be cited instead. An additional question is, do these sources actually support the claim of "hundreds" of Jews rescued by Pfeiffer personally? (t · c) buidhe 08:51, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I've now found sources that cover most of the article. Here are more: Liebhart (1996) Schwangau. Meding (1992), Flucht vor Nürnberg. Sinn (1976), Illegal. Prince Constantine of Bavaria (1952) Der Papst. Layer (1985), Schwäbisches Ehrenbuch - Pfeiffer credited with "saving Rome and other Italian cities including Chieti, Ascoli and Ovieto from destruction and other calamities" _ (1999). Publik-Forum - Pfeiffer the only German to have a street named after him in Rome and who fought to save Roman Jews. _ (1960). Bayerische Frömmigkeit - Pfeiffer described as the "Saviour of Rome and other cities in Italy" Robert Katz has written a number of books - Death in Rome (1967), Black Sabbath (1969), The Battle for Rome (2010) - which all mention Pfeiffer. Bottum and Dalin (2004). The Pius War has this interesting piece: "7. Pancrazio [sic] Pfeiffer. According to Carroll-Abbing, one of the men used by Pius XII to protest the Nazi roundup of Rome's Jews and intervene for persecuted victims was Father Pancrazio Pfeiffer, superior general of the Salvatorian Fathers, who also served as Pius XII' personal liaison to the German military command in Rome. Because Pfeiffer died tragically in an automobile accident toward the end of the war and thus never took part in the postwar analysis of Pius XII's conduct, many historians have overlooked him. But those who knew him or have researched his life have chronicled his collaborative efforts with Pius XII to rescue Jews and others during the war. See the article "Pfeiffer's List" by Robert Graham, 30 Days, June 1994, pp. 42-46. Prince Constantine of Bavaria's book on Pius XII, The Pope (London: Allan Wingate, 1954) [listed above] contains an excellent section on Pfeiffer, whom he describes as an agent for the pope on behalf of the victims of persecution and the fugitives in hiding" (p. 213). At Pfeiffer's death in May 1945, Vatican Radio paid tribute: "He came into contact with the Commander of the German occupying forces [in Rome in 1943-44]. From that day onwards, he placed his religious and spiritual qualities at the service of many who had been arrested or already condemned to death. He helped countless people in this way, and saved their lives, among them many Jews and other Italian personages. He championed..." In short there seems to be book evidence for virtually everything stated in the article apart from the specific details of the two incidents where 249 or 400 Jews were rescued. Based on my initial searches my expectation is that those incidents are likely to be recorded in the literature - we just need to be able to access more of the sources. Meanwhile there is no harm in pausing to use some of the above sources, plus those I've added to the Further reading section of the article in order to reinforce the existing references and then review where we are. Bermicourt (talk) 08:41, 27 October 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: thoughts? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 07:09, 4 November 2021 (UTC) I don't think the article currently meets DYK requirements. For example, Salvatorians USA Province is not independent of the article subject and therefore is not reliable for self-serving assertions such as "he saved many Jews in Rome from persecution and ultimately death" or "Every day, Pfeiffer visited the Regina Coeli prison and another prison on Via Tasso, where he would often return with freed prisoners who had been sentenced to death." (t · c) buidhe 08:27, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: would you still object if the article instead relied on the sources found by Bermicourt? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 04:58, 5 November 2021 (UTC) Depends, the Samerski source looks reliable to me but the book published by "Österreichische Provinz der Salvatorianer" has the same issue of close connection to the article subject. (t · c) buidhe 06:27, 5 November 2021 (UTC) All right. @Ergo Sum: I'm not going to promote the nomination without consensus to move forward, so if you want to try and rework the article's sourcing to approval, that can work.

This slipped my mind completely this weekend. I will deal with this tonight. Ergo Sum 15:45, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I have added several inline citations to the article, which refer to sources that were (very helpfully) added by Bermicourt. These sources support several of the very specific claims in the article, as well as the general thrust of the article which is in dispute here, namely that Pfeiffer was a liaison and in that capacity saved many Jews and others from the Nazis. In light of these reliable sources supporting the general claims, I think any concern about the pre-existing ones describing some of his more specific actions is ameliorated. There is a trove of additional sources in the Further Reading section that additionally describe in much greater detail Pfeiffer's actions but they are either in a foreign language which I do not adequately read to make use of as citations or are offline. All being said, I think there is now ample sourcing to back up the article's claims. Ergo Sum 05:49, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks, Ergo Sum—@Buidhe:, if this sourcing is up to your standards, we can move ahead. If not, we're probably going back to WT:DYK and asking for more eyes. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 05:52, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Hi, I've flagged the specific content in the article that supports the hook as needing a better source. There are other active cleanup tags on the article as well. However, I think there's sufficient sourcing for a modified version of the hook without the words "hundreds of". (t · c) buidhe 06:06, 17 November 2021 (UTC) We could cite "countless" using the ref above instead of "hundreds of". Bermicourt (talk) 08:33, 17 November 2021 (UTC) According to the source it's what Vatican Radio said about him after his death. DYK is not for eulogies imo. (t · c) buidhe 08:37, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I'm not following—is the source unreliable because it's after his death? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 08:40, 17 November 2021 (UTC) No, it's because it's Catholic presumably... We could always add "according to Vatican Radio..." But better still, we just need to cite the exact text from one of the many non-Catholic book sources and the problem will be solved. Bermicourt (talk) 08:46, 17 November 2021 (UTC) And yet another source: O'Reilly (2001) in Forgotten Battles: Italy's War of Liberation 1943-45 states that "the Vatican was able to assist many of Rome's Jews and others sought by the Germans through Father Pancrazio Pfeiffer's intervention with the Germans... His work was recounted by Robert Graham who has written extensively on the Vatican's role in World War II." Bermicourt (talk) 09:01, 17 November 2021 (UTC) And another: Bartley (2016) in Catholics Confronting Hitler states that "Father Pancrace [sic] Pfeiffer, a German priest and the superior general of the Salvatorian Order, was the pope's liaison with the German military. Several hundred hostages, including some under sentence of death, owed their release to the efficacious intervention of Father Pfeiffer." I don't know why I'm doing this - you can look up the references yourselves instead of opining and speculating from the sidelines in the classic Wikipedia way. :) Bermicourt (talk) 09:08, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @Bermicourt: Since it seems you have access to several sources that I do not (probably just requires further digging), would you want to add them as inline citations with page numbers, especially to support the proposition regarding hundreds of people saved?

I'd be in favor instead of the hook being split into two separate proposals: one hook about the fact that she was an internet celebrity who grew up in a place without tap water, and a separate hook about her going viral for making hamburgers. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:23, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Full review needed, which can also address the issue of the borderline ALT1 hook. BlueMoonset (talk) 04:23, 5 November 2021 (UTC) As far as I can tell the article meets DYK requirements, and a QPQ has been done. Earwigs finds a close match with Coda Media, but that's only because it was the source for quotes in the article, and all of them are properly referenced. I find the first hook hard to believe given China's international standing, and in any case as brought up by Bowlhover may be inaccurate anyway. As for the second hook, as I mentioned before it's ineligible as it's exactly 200 characters long, and per WP:DYK hooks that are at or shorter than 200 characters may be rejected per reviewer's discretion. Both ALT0 and ALT1 have struck: I am repeating my earlier suggestion that ALT1 instead be split into two separate hooks. As this is a China-related article and there appear to be some political discussion in the article, I'd also like to ask for a second opinion from someone more knowledgeable about China-related articles if the article doesn't fall afoul of relevant guidelines. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 13:12, 6 November 2021 (UTC) From Wikipedia:Did you know#The hook: The hook should be concise: no more than about 200 characters (including spaces and the question mark, but not including the ..., the space immediately following the ..., or any (pictured)). While 200 is a hard limit, hooks near or at this limit may still be rejected at the discretion of reviewers and administrators. This tool can be used for counting words. The guideline says that "200 is a hard limit", so it is not true that the 200-character ALT1 hook is "ineligible" or "simply too long". No reason has been given for rejecting a 200-character hook "at the discretion of reviewers". Here are two additional hooks based on the suggestion: ALT2: ... that Dianxi Xiaoge, who grew up in a remote Yunnan mountain without running water, is an Internet celebrity with roughly 16 million subscribers on all her platforms? ALT3: ... Dianxi Xiaoge went viral in China and internationally after making hamburgers for her grandparents who had never eaten them before? Cunard (talk) 07:48, 7 November 2021 (UTC) Well for one thing, the original was very difficult to read and seemed to combine too many facts into one hook. Usually DYK prefers simpler hooks whenever possible. In any case, I think ALT3 is the best hook here and the nomination is otherwise good to go, I'd just like to hear a second opinion from another editor on the article tone given that I'm a bit uncomfortable doing a solo review here given the "Commentary" section delves into some political matters. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:36, 7 November 2021 (UTC) On second thought, I have some concerns regarding the length of the article.

Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 11:10, 7 November 2021 (UTC) That the article is "rather detailed for an internet celebrity's page" should not be a concern. The sources provided substantial analysis of her and her work, and this article reflects those sources. Other detailed articles for Internet celebrities include PewDiePie and MrBeast. Cunard (talk) 11:18, 7 November 2021 (UTC) Pinging Gatoclass for his input, as he responded to a discussion I raised about this nomination over at WT:DYK. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:57, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I don't think we need Gatoclass to restate themself. Here's what they said at WT:DYK: The article doesn't use the phrase "one of only three Chinese influencers to gain international influence", so I'm not sure where you got that, but it does say she is one of only three "Chinese Internet celebrities who have reached international prominence", and the problem with that claim is that it's sourced to an article that is two years old and therefore not up-to-date. With regard to the overall length, I would agree that it is overly detailed and could use a trim. I'm not sure this is relevant to DYK however, as "overly detailed" is not one of our criteria. What I would say is that the level of detail does raise the chances of close paraphrasing so the article would need to be carefully checked for that. Anybody else with an opinion on this article?

Since that's technically a plot point I don't think it would meet the guideline.

I think ALT1 is fine. Thriley (talk) 15:43, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Thriley, please see this. More copyedits are necessary. The next sentence has an erroneous comma. And the "first film" in the hook--isn't that actually her fifth or so? Do you mean "feature film" or some such thing? Thank you, Drmies (talk) 17:20, 14 November 2021 (UTC) What about this hook? ALT2 “That in the Pedro Almodóvar film Parallel Mothers, Milena Smit and Penélope Cruz play pregnant women who give birth on the same day?” Thriley (talk) 20:46, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @Theleekycauldron: Is this hook acceptable under the guidelines? Thriley (talk) 20:57, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @Thriley: I'll ping BlueMoonset here in case I'm wrong, but I'm going to say no, it isn't. My reasoning here is that if the hook were read as plaintext, without any bolding or linking, it would be read as pretty much only interesting as it concerns the plot. The hook should concern Smit's life; if it concerns her work as an actress, only stating her role and not anything about production doesn't make the hook out-of-universe. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 21:28, 17 November 2021 (UTC) theleekycauldron, I was taking a look at the ALT1 hook and its sources, and the second Biography sentence is basically copied from Esquire—the Google translate version, at any rate. That's a problem. Another problem is that the source doesn't actually say that she was working as a hotel receptionist when she got the call, just that it was "one of these jobs", referring back to the four in the previous sentence, none of which were hotel receptionist. The article also needs a bit of copyediting. I don't think that either of the plot-based hooks should be used, and as Drmies notes, "first film" is not accurate, since it's Cross the Line that's in the source, which appears to be her fifth film. We could only use "first feature film" if the previous four in her filmography were all short films (which would need to be clearly sourced). Perhaps an angle for the information in ALT1 would be to say she was working in whatever job it was when she was cast in Cross the Line, for which she was nominated as best new actress in the Goya Awards.

Particularly with "Conflict with Miles and Reynolds", there's four citations crammed at the end of the section.

Nice addition. well done Victuallers (talk) 10:31, 6 November 2021 (UTC) Reopening this because I think the hook is misleading, as according to the source it was usual for women of the nobility, like Neville, to sign with their own names.

So the hooks are misleading.

(Someone shouts) "BUT all British Queens do that!!" (Someone shouts) "That implies that it was unusual for Queens to sign with just their first name." No it doesnt. I think @Gatoclass: is reading the source and then saying that the hook doesnt explain every piece of information in the source... which obviously it doesnt. Its unusual that "a woman" is doing this at all. It WAS unusual for women in the fourteenth century to sign and if they did then they did not usually use just their own name. Its a fact - its unusual. Did You know that women did not sign their own names on documents in the 14th century? No I didnt. That is something that Lajmmoore wrote about and now I know. Thanks. Victuallers (talk) 08:28, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Hello Gatoclass all so the part of the source I was using is this, which is talking about signatures for charitable donation "Although most of the widows declare themselves to be the wife of their late husband, or their father's daughter, others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names, such as 'domina Margareta de Longvl' and 'don-ýina Margareta de Nevill' (the same person). The majority of widows declare that their marital status and their power to act, using a variety of phrases, including 'in pura viduitate', 'in pura viduitate mea et ligia potestate', and 'in viduitate mea propria et potestate legitima' ..." and I read that as it was more usual for (noble) women to use a signature that described them as "wife of, etc..." I read the passage as Legg using Margaret de Neville as an unusual example. Legg is talking about the Coucher Book signatures specifically, but I still think they are marking out unusual practice. In terms of the hook, I wonder whether changing 'woman' to 'literate woman' might work? Lajmmoore (talk) 09:32, 19 November 2021 (UTC) No, it wouldn't work just to add "literate". And your reading of the text just amounts to an unsupported assumption on your part. Because while the text could admittedly be less ambiguous, the statement that others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names does not in any way suggest that it was rare or unusual for a member of the nobility to give their name, it only states that members of the nobility as a class were inclined to give their names. So there isn't sufficient support in that statement for a hook which implies that Neville's act was in any way unusual for a member of her class. The hook makes Neville sound like some sort of proto-feminist who boldly challenged the system, when the underlying source only indicates that either her entire class did the same thing, or at least that it was an accepted practice for members of the nobility. So I still think that either the hook needs to be substantially reworked to more closely reflect the source, or a new hook be found. Gatoclass (talk) 02:53, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks for sharing your interpretation of your text Gatoclass. My interpretation (& so the hook) is based on Legg's use of the word most - in that "most of the widows declare themselves to be the wife of their late husband, or their father's daughter" and you rightly point out "others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names" but I think that needs to be balanced by the "most" earlier in the sentence i.e. for women generally, they don't give their name, but some noble women do but overall, for women signing their name, it is unusual enough to be pointed out in the text.

Whispyhistory (talk) 06:32, 13 November 2021 (UTC) I don't see that exact sequence of numbers in the source, although there are others that look a bit like an IP address. The trouble is, the nominator seems to be the source for it looking a bit like an IP address, which it does, but we can't use that unless the source makes a similar point, which it does not appear to do.

I don't see how the hook you're suggesting is hooky. What exactly is wrong with the hook proposed? It's in the article and it's supported by the sources cited. And the image is directly related to the hook. It engages the reader into a spotting game. Dr. Vogel (talk) 14:57, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Like everyone else, I rather like the IP-address hook. If we wikilinked IP address, it would be supported in the linked articles, and fulfill the requirement that anyone following the links will be able to verify the hook. I don't think we need sourcing that says that a specific sequence of numbers is an IP address, as we have sources giving the general format of an IP address, and creating an example would be a trivial calculation ("Are all four of these numbers separated by periods in the range 0-255?"): "IPv4 and IPv6 address formats". www.ibm.com. An IPv4 address has the following format: x . x . x . x where x is called an octet and must be a decimal value between 0 and 255. Octets are separated by periods. An IPv4 address must contain three periods and four octets. The following examples are valid IPv4 addresses: 1 . 2 . 3 . 4 01 . 102 . 103 . 104 This hook is better than any alternative I can think of, and I don't see anything likely to be problematic about it (it's certainly verifiable). I think we might be in agreement on that? So if some rule technically prohibits it, we might have a good case for applying the WP:Ignore all the rules policy. Broken finger is also currently DYK-eligible and I think it uses the same numbering scheme.[1] HLHJ (talk) 02:07, 14 November 2021 (UTC) [edit: add fulltext url] I don't necessarily agree with the reading of WP:DYKCRIT 3b ( Each fact in the hook must be supported in the article by at least one inline citation to a reliable source [...]) that says that the IP thing needs to be in the article (compare e.g. Template:Did you know nominations/Urine deflector, which similarly took some creative licence in how the proposed hooks were phrased beyond what was stated in either the article or the cited source), and I agree with HLHJ that WP:IAR would be applicable regardless. As for the hooks themselves, writing "a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone may be described as 88.5.3.2" is a much poorer way of writing the hook (less "hooky") than the converse, i.e. "88.5.3.2 may refer to a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone". TompaDompa (talk) 11:28, 14 November 2021 (UTC) This. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 17:01, 16 November 2021 (UTC) We can't use IP address because the nominator just thought it up "oh, that looks like an IP address". It's not in the source as the nominator admits and therefore is not verifiable. And so what if it does look like an IP address? What does that tell us about broken toes? I like clever or quirky hooks and have written many (if I may say so), but they have to be based on something in the sources otherwise it's things made up one day. Philafrenzy (talk) 10:19, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you for all your comments. This is not the place to ignore all rules. The proposed hook is not supported by the source given in the article. I am inclined to approve ALT1 but it needs checking, unless another hook is proposed. Whispyhistory (talk) 15:11, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Oh dear, this has become contentious. I think the contended question is whether it's acceptable to have verified information not found in the nominated article, but only in another article, linked in the hook. Not as hooky, but for illustration: ALT3 ... that the dot-decimal notation string "88.5.3.2" is not only an an IPv4 address, but also a fracture in the middle of the bone at the tip of the little toe? "IPv4 and IPv6 address formats". www.ibm.com., Hallux proximal phalanx fracture in adults: an overlooked diagnosis I don't think we're debating whether the IP-address-hook statement is verifiable. The statement that "88.5.3.2" (and any number in that format) is a valid IPv4 address is supported by the IP address article and the IPv4 article, and this format is the subject of the Dot-decimal notation article. No-one had bothered to cite those statements in those articles, but since they've been challenged here, I've now cited them. So "88.5.3.2 is both an IP address[1] and a code for a broken toebone[2]" is certainly verifiable, and is now verified on Wikipedia. Any DYK reader should have no trouble verifying that the hook is accurate. Alternatives that do not mention IP addressees are not as hooky, but don't contain more information about broken toes: ALT4 ... that "88.5.3.2" is a toe fracture in the middle of the bone at the tip of the little toe, while a "78.5.3.2" is the parallel broken finger?

HLHJ (talk) 20:22, 14 November 2021 (UTC) [edited to replace the wrong url, copy-paste mistake] Please don't strike the proposed hook as you have done. You certainly don't have consensus to do that. As several people have explained above, the hook is supported by the article and the source. Dr. Vogel (talk) 15:31, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I don't think the reviewer needs consensus Dr Vogel. I agree and have re-struck it. Please work on something else. I am sure you can develop something good, or tweak the Alt1. Philafrenzy (talk) 19:24, 14 November 2021 (UTC) How about ALT2 ....that 88.5.3.2 is one way of describing a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone? Philafrenzy (talk) 19:25, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you Philafrenzy ( a very experienced DYK contributor) for your efforts in helping new editors understand DYK. Your comment higher up about "88.5.3.2" and "ip address" not being in the source is true and I am grateful for your suggested alts. Essentially, the initial and subsequent hooks sound good, but none are in the article or the source. I don't wish for personal comments and don't mind if someone else wishes to take over here. With due respect @DrVogel: and @HLHJ:...You may wish to take this up at Wikipedia talk:Did you know. Whispyhistory (talk) 10:41, 15 November 2021 (UTC) I won't say I wish I hadn't written the article; I hope it's useful enough to make up for the social harm to the project here. I don't think the hostility was intended by anyone; I suspect that it's felt partly due to the ease of mininterpretation in a text-only medium and partly due to human cognitive biases.[2] I certainly did, and do, not intend it. I spent a day's editing trying to resolve the conflict by finding references specifically saying that the two things were in notation X and adding that text to the article, but unfortunately non-inductive descriptions of the notations seem to have been considered so needless that an Internet RFC attempting to formalize them died of disinterest. I did find a source that explicitly defines the IPv4 format, and one that explicitly says that 88.1.2.2 is a specific fracture, and I've cited the latter in the article, but I don't think this helps. It is probably a bit unreasonable to expect a reviewer to do more than apply rules as best they can, and Wikipedia talk:Did you know might indeed be a better forum for a more detailed discussion. I don't really want to take part in one, though (nothing to do with this discussion, prior reasons). I posted because I felt responsible for the conflict and thought I might be able to help. My impression is that I made it worse; my apologies to everyone I've offended. HLHJ (talk) 03:41, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Nobody is offended, but if I may say so I think you are still missing the point. IP addresses have nothing to do with broken toes even if that notation may have a similarity. That's why the sources don't make the comparison and why the IP-based hooks are no good. Any of the other hooks might be fine (I haven't checked the numbers) just without the bit about IP addresses. The whole thing reminds me of unusually shaped vegetables where you may see a carrot shaped like a foot, people who see faces in clouds, and even apophenia. My personal observation that one thing looks a bit like another is not the basis for a hook unless reliable sources make the point too. Philafrenzy (talk) 09:09, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Folks, we are wasting a wonderful hook. Really. IP addresses have nothing to do with broken toes even if that notation may have a similarity and that is the whole point of making good hooks. They are supposed to be short, punchy, catchy, and likely to draw the readers in to wanting to read the article – as long as they don't misstate the article content. And one of the best recipes to make a hook good is to make it sound counterintuitive With any other option but the original, we are bound to receive another hook frequented by maybe a few hundred visitors. I would propose something to the tune of in some contexts, 88.5.3.2 might not mean an IP address but a broken bone in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone? so that no one claims here that we somehow delegitimise the IP address but at the same time so that we preserve the core of the hook. As for the claims that because the hook is not cited in the IP part, it can't be there - please don't be that pedantic. In our today's world of informatics we may assume that people who visit Wikipedia more or less imagine what IP addresses are, and may more or less imagine how they look like (in the worst case they will visit the article for details). The other part is cited. I see no problem with the original. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 17:01, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Szmenderowiecki I admit that I'm not very familiar with the topic, and the above discussion was confusing, but is the "this isn't an IP address" claim actually in the source? Because if it's not, then no matter how good the hook proposal is, it can't be used in a hook since hook facts need to be based on a reference. Also, I'm pretty sure that assumptions don't count as sources. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:31, 17 November 2021 (UTC) What I was leading is that we don't need to cite that the sky is blue, or that we have five fingers; or that there exist IP addresses for that matter. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 11:08, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Given that these IP number hooks aren't working out so far, I wonder if some other hooks unrelated to that could be proposed here. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 02:11, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Comment only If we accept the first hook we will end up with thousands of hits, some quiet smiles and some who will continue to believe that DYK broke the rules. We're allowed to. This is not a massive occasion where we can save the whole project by breaking the rules. Its a trivial example of what some (not all) think may be a breach in the rules, with a small, but amusing, advantage. So I'm not asking the defenders of the rules to admit that this is not a breech ... I am suggesting that they might just concede that the harm done by allowing this hook might not offend anyone ... and it might please a few thousand.

Nominated by Victuallers (talk) at 16:21, 6 November 2021 (UTC). Article is new enough. Two correct writers are credited. The article is fully referenced. No copyvio detected. There is a bit of biased POV pushing in Wikipedia voice: "most vulnerable to climate change". This will be something our subject is saying no doubt. And this idea is also reflected in the hook with "endangered". The hook content is referenced and confirmed by the Guardian, apart from the "endangered" bit, which opinion is attributed to Tina Stege. So I suggest that "endangered" is taken out of the hook, or it is reworded so it is clear she is saying that. Hook alt1 is unsuitable as it does not link the article and I cannot tell what it is trying to say in relation to the subject. I can confirm image is CC-BY-3.0 as derived from the video with CC-BY-3.0 license. However I would suggest that a different image is selected from the video, perhaps near the end where the microphone is not obscuring her chin. QPQ is done.

Self-nominated at 23:51, 4 November 2021 (UTC). @DferDaisy: This article is about 3300 bytes, and was nominated for DYK shortly after creation, satisfying date and length criteria. There is a factual error, as the article states she was interred in Keokuk, Illinois, but the source says she died in Chicago, Illinois and was interred in Keokuk, Iowa. I am assuming good faith for a few references I cannot access (for example, ref 15 - The National Humane Review), which for me gives a landing page for the document, instead of an inside view). Otherwise, everything is properly sourced and there are no copyvio or close paraphrasing concerns (Earwig cites 3 potential problems, but they are not an issue here.) QPQ not required. Regarding the hooks, ALT0 is incorrect as stated, as it reads as if the study was conducted in the early 1900s by Meigs Crowder, whereas she published it in 1917 based on studies from that period. It'll need minor alteration. ALT1 is fine and sourced. I would prefer to promote an amended ALT0. A minor quibble, though not an issue for DYK: please add page numbers for cited sources.

(!!!) 01:52, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @AleatoryPonderings: Yes, but note that this court case is the "leading case with respect to the issue of common employers", establishing a precedent in Canadian law. At the time the lawsuit was filed, this was not the case, and in fact the trial judge ruled against Alouche (see last paragraph of background section); it was only after the case was brought to the Court of Appeal for Ontario that the "common employer doctrine" was established, and it became entrenched when leave to appeal the decision at the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed. Mindmatrix 15:11, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Ah, so the idea behind the hook is that, since Downtown Eatery changed the law on common employers, before Downtown Eatery Best Beaver would not have been Alouche's employer? That makes more sense. AleatoryPonderings (???) (!!!) 15:20, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: I'm going to inspect this again... Mindmatrix 15:18, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @AleatoryPonderings: Alright, so to ensure everything is correct, the following timeline occurred: Alouche was hired to be manager at For Your Eyes Only (owned by Grad and Grosman), and began work on 29 December 1992 Alouche was sent a Notice of Discipline in May 1993, and was fired on 15 June 1993 In October 1993, Alouche filed action for wrongful dismissal against Best Beaver Management Inc., as that was the source of his paycheques Best Beaver ceased operations in mid-1996, and all assets distributed to other companies owned by Grad and Grosman The trial resolved in favour of Alouche Best Beaver did not pay out the judgement (all its assets had been redistributed) Sherriffs were dispatched to For Your Eyes Only, where they seized $1,855 Downtown Eatery filed claim against Alouche, stating the cash belonged to it Alouche defended, and counterclaimed against Grad, Grosman, and all companies they controlled on the grounds of common employer doctrine, the oppression remedy of the Ontario Business Corporations Act, and fraudulent conveyance the judge in the second trial (at Ontario Superior Court of Justice) ruled against Alouche the case was brought to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, where the previous ruling was overturned in 2001 in January 2002, an application for leave to appeal the decision at the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed So, the common employer doctrine was part of the second trial as a counterclaim to the suit filed by Downtown Eatery. I just wanted to ensure this satisfies your concerns. Mindmatrix 18:25, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks for this incredibly thorough response. My concern is maybe philosophical or definitional. If I say that company A employs person B, that has an ordinary meaning and a legal meaning. It is probably right that Best Beaver did not employ Alouche in the ordinary sense of "employ", because Best Beaver was a "paymaster" and not the name on the front of the building where he went to work. My reading of the case itself is that, before Downtown Eatery, it was at best indeterminate as a legal matter whether Best Beaver, alone or in combination with its affiliate companies, employed Alouche. After Downtown Eatery, it was established—as a matter of legal meaning, but not necessarily ordinary meaning—that Best Beaver was his employer, or part of his employer, or something like that. The reason I brought this up is that it's not clear how one could verify the claim that "Best Beaver was not Alouche's employer", because that claim might be true as a matter of ordinary meaning but the only authoritative legal ruling we have on this (namely, Downtown Eatery) holds that the claim is false. In any event, I'll leave this to the eventual reviewer to sort out. I find my brain twisting into knots. AleatoryPonderings (???)

Additionally, per MOS:FILMCAST uncredited roles need a source. the copyvio checker showed up a 50%+ similarity with a source, which may suggest over quotation.

However, I have an issue with the hook which is not directly supported by the source. The source says that the two tribes hunt the bird for bushmeat and decorate their headgear and houses with its feathers and beaks. In another place it just says that "the gizzard of the hornbill was used in some local medicines for curing stomach disorders," but nowhere is this stated as a belief of those two tribes. So it needs to be amended to reflect the source. Alternatively there are some "fascinating facts" at the Oakland Zoo source that could be used, noting that they use a different English name, but the same Latin one. That name, Malayan wreathed hornbill, should perhaps be included in the lede. Also I wonder if the existing alternative name should just be bar-pouched hornbill as per the same website? Bermicourt (talk) 13:57, 11 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks for your feedback, Bermicourt! Re the gizzard : true is that it is not stated in any source that the local people believe .., but only that they use it for curing stomach problems. So I wonder whether the hook should / can be changed to either a) that they use it as medicine, or b) to a different hook altogether, e.g. something about the bird itself : that it flies up to some 25 km from its breeding site in search of favoured fruits, much farther than any other hornbill species. I didn't add this info yet, but can do if you think it worthwhile? Re the name "Malayan wreathed hornbill" : Blanford (1889) seems to have been the first and only one who used this name, but I haven't seen this in any other publication yet. – BhagyaMani (talk) 21:44, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks also to @Casliber: for DYK nominating this page!! – BhagyaMani (talk) 21:44, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, I think this article is worthy of a DYK, but you need to come up with one or two alternative hooks.

Source: 1 and 2 Comment: This is the first time I’ve ever made a DYK here, so here goes. I personally find this fact interesting because it highlights how the advent of YouTube, and internet fame in general, has allowed people to use their voice to reach people in positions of high influence, bringing hidden ideas to light and advocating for change. While this specific example falls under a video game/pop-culture category, and may not fit Wikipedia’s desire for academic material, I feel that this is interesting enough to share, as it’s one the gaming community can relate to, like with other social media trends such as #FreeSmash and "Rerelease Mother 3." As for the article itself, all of the citations should be reliable enough; they’re all from third-party/secondary source outlets and there isn’t any BLP violation to be found here. One concern I have is criteria #3 - “Each fact in the hook must be supported in the article by at least one inline citation to a reliable source, appearing no later than the end of the sentence(s) offering that fact. Citations at the end of the paragraph are not sufficient.” While the hook is sourced in the article, the refs are at the end of the section rather than per each sentence. I can fix that however. Anyway, I hope this fact does get accepted! If not, I understand, thanks for reviewing this anyway. Created/expanded by PantheonRadiance (talk). Self-nominated at 08:45, 17 November 2021 (UTC).

You'd need to have expanded the text content by 5x in length, which I am not seeing in the page history. You'll also need to resolve the many tags for additional citations and expansion in the article. Your best bet would be to get it to good article status and renominate then.

Kaleeb18 (talk) 16:28, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Hi Kaleeb18, no worries and good luck with the article.

The hook is in-line sourced. Photo has appropriate license. QPQ is done. There are, however, two problems: (1) There is some significant overlap with this source. To start, the following sentence is taken from the source without use of quotation marks and with no effort to paraphrase rather than use the precise words: "Local advocacy led to the establishment of Bridle Trails as a state park in 1932." Further, this sentence also strikes me as too closely drawn from the same source: "Initial park development dates to 1933 when Civil Works Administration employees and federal relief workers were employed in state parks as part of the New Deal program. Further work included burning logging debris, clearing brush and building trails and fences." Work needs to be done to put the material into your own words. (2) The hook strikes me as boring in that it states an obvious point. Horses having the right of way on this trail is not unique or special. On trails that are shared by humans and horses, it is the general rule that horses have the right of way. See here ("In general, horses always have the right of way, followed by hikers, then by bikers."). See also here ("For safety reasons, if you come across a horse and rider on any trail they always have right of way. Hikers and bike riders all yield to horses.") To include this on the main page, we really need something that is hooky or interesting about this trail.

Self-nominated at 05:17, 15 November 2021 (UTC). I agree that the thing about the misquotation is the hookiest fact in the article, but it's clumsily phrased here. For one, the quote is not actually "could have been made by aliens" so, considering this is all about misquotation, we should either use the actual quote or clarify that it is a misquotation. Then "as though it was a real announcement" implies that it was actually, I don't know, a fake announcement? A parody? Also, essay collections don't speak: the chapter in question was written by William Edmonson. –?Joe (talk) 09:05, 15 November 2021 (UTC) It's a lot of context to try squeeze into 200 characters, so, and I can't believe I'm suggesting this, why not go with a simple April Fools-style hook: ALT2 ... that according to a NASA essay collection, ancient carvings "might have been made by aliens"?

Reviewed: Thomas Guggeis Comment: This article was created over about 5 months in userspace, then copied and pasted to mainspace on 16 November. As far as I am aware, Queen Victoria never wore the Koh-i-Noor set in a necklace, though she did wear it set in a brooch and in a circlet (headdress). So the necklace with the Koh-i-Noor in this sculpture is probably artistic licence. Created by Storye book (talk). Self-nominated at 16:10, 17 November 2021 (UTC). Captivating storey of a life and career, meticulously referenced on plenty of fine sources, offline sources accepted AGF, no copyvio obvious. The image is licensed. The hook works, but I don't see the diamond in the image. I am willing to approve it but would like to discuss other options: mention the artistic license, because I didn't know the detail of her not wearing that gem in a necklace don't mention the diamond detail, focus on the jubilee, and use the second image from the gallery which show the greatness of the design better than the head detail base a hook on the Warrior/Youth work which I find much more attractive as an artwork, and as an image in small size ;) Let me know. Take that article to GA please, I think it's ready. - Graham87, can you please do the history merge for him? --Gerda Arendt (talk) 06:57, 18 November 2021 (UTC) @Gerda Arendt: I didn't do the history merge because it's not needed. Graham87 09:41, 18 November 2021 (UTC) @Gerda Arendt: Thank you for the review. Diamonds were often cut in cabochon style in the 19th century and earlier. This one was cut with a flat bottom like all cabochons, and when viewed from above, it was a large oval, about 1.5 inches long. Modern cabochons usually have a smoothly rounded surface; this one was lightly faceted but the facets don't show on the sculpture. So it looks like half an egg, I suppose. The Koh-i-Noor is the large oval at the bottom of the picture. We have no specific citation for artistic licence - that is just a conclusion that we can probably make, since we have no evidence that Victoria ever had it set in a necklace. Therefore I cannot use "artistic licence" in a hook or in the article. I'll have a go at a hook using a full-length Victoria, and another hook using the Warrior and Wounded Youth sculpture. I'll come back shortly with those.

I've been trying to come up with something catchy on this -- for example, had Comeau invited Trump to participate in a performance of the work, then we could say he told Trump to fugue himself -- but the sourcing just isn't there that I can see.

I therefore want to use this platform to suggest ways we can contribute to meaningful anti-Trump resistance.". We'd need to flesh out the article with these WP:BLPPRIMARY sources for the "thinks" to be properly verifiable.

Further information: Official supplementary guidelines and unofficial guide  Warning: You are not logged in. Please create an account or log in to proceed. Alternatively, you may leave a message at the bottom of the DYK project talk page with the article you would like to nominate and the hook you would like to propose.  Warning: The helper script only works on desktop. Please switch to desktop view to continue. Install the DYK helper script by adding the line {{subst:lusc|User:SD0001/DYK-helper.js}} to your common.js page. Go back to the article, and choose the "DYK" option from the "More" menu (see image). Fill in the form and submit it. Check back periodically to address comments or concerns from the reviewer (it may take several weeks). Manual instructions[edit] Create a subpage for your new DYK suggestion and then list the page below under the date the article was created or the expansion began or it became a good article (not the date you submit it here), with the newest dates at the bottom. Any registered user may nominate a DYK suggestion (if you are not a registered user, please leave a message at the bottom of the DYK project talk page with the details of the article you would like to nominate and the hook you would like to propose); self-nominations are permitted and encouraged. Thanks for participating and please remember to check back for comments on your nomination (consider watchlisting your nomination page). Read these instructions completely before proceeding. For simplified instructions, see User:Rjanag/Quick DYK 2. I. Create the nomination subpage. Enter the article title in the box below and click the button. (To nominate multiple articles together, enter any or all of the article titles.) You will then be taken to a preloaded nomination page. II. Write the nomination. On the nomination page, fill in the relevant information. See Template:NewDYKnomination and {{NewDYKnomination/guide}} for further information. Not every line of the template needs to be filled in. For instance, if you are not nominating an image to appear with your hook, there is no need to fill in the image-related lines. Add an edit summary e.g. "Nominating YOUR ARTICLE TITLE for DYK" and click Publish page. Make sure the nomination page is on your watchlist, so you can follow the review discussion. III. Post at Template talk:Did you know. In the current nominations section find the subsection for the date on which the article was created or on which expansion began (or, if a new Good Article, the date on which it became a GA), not the date on which you make the nomination. At the top of that subsection (before other nominations already there, but below the section head and hidden comment) add {{Did you know nominations/YOUR ARTICLE TITLE}}. Add an edit summary e.g. "Nominating YOUR ARTICLE TITLE for DYK" and click Publish page. Frequently asked questions[edit] How do I write an interesting hook? Successful hooks tend to have several traits. Most importantly, they share a surprising or intriguing fact. They give readers enough context to understand the hook, but leave enough out to make them want to learn more. They are written for a general audience who has no prior knowledge of or interest in the topic area. Lastly, they are concise, and do not attempt to cover multiple facts or present information about the subject beyond what's needed to understand the hook. When will my nomination be reviewed? This page is often backlogged. As long as your submission is still on the page, it will stay there until an editor reviews it. Since editors are encouraged to review the oldest submissions first, it may take several weeks until your submission is reviewed. In the meantime, please consider reviewing another submission (not your own) to help reduce the backlog (see instructions below). Where is my hook? If you can't find the nomination you submitted to this nominations page, it may have been approved and is on the approved nominations page waiting to be promoted. It could also have been added to one of the prep areas, promoted from prep to a queue, or is on the main page. If the nominated hook is in none of those places, then the nomination has probably been rejected. Such a rejection usually only occurs if it was at least a couple of weeks old and had unresolved issues for which any discussion had gone stale. If you think your nomination was unfairly rejected, you can query this on the DYK discussion page, but as a general rule such nominations will only be restored in exceptional circumstances. Instructions for reviewers[edit] Main page: Wikipedia:Did you know/Reviewing guide Any editor who was not involved in writing/expanding or nominating an article may review it by checking to see that the article meets all the DYK criteria (long enough, new enough, no serious editorial or content issues) and the hook is cited. Editors may also alter the suggested hook to improve it, suggest new hooks, or even lend a hand and make edits to the article to which the hook applies so that the hook is supported and accurate. For a more detailed discussion of the DYK rules and review process see the supplementary guidelines and the WP:Did you know/Reviewing guide. To post a comment or review on a DYK nomination, follow the steps outlined below: Look through this page, Template talk:Did you know, to find a nomination you would like to comment on. Click the "Review or comment" link at the top of the nomination. You will be taken to the nomination subpage. The top of the page includes a list of the DYK criteria. Check the article to ensure it meets all the relevant criteria. To indicate the result of the review (i.e., whether the nomination passes, fails, or needs some minor changes), leave a signed comment on the page. Please begin with one of the 5 review symbols that appear at the top of the edit screen, and then indicate all aspects of the article that you have reviewed; your comment should look something like the following: Article length and age are fine, no copyvio or plagiarism concerns, reliable sources are used. But the hook needs to be shortened. If you are the first person to comment on the nomination, there will be a line :* <!-- REPLACE THIS LINE TO WRITE FIRST COMMENT, KEEPING  :* --> showing you where you should put the comment. Save the page. If there is any problem or concern about a nomination, please consider notifying the nominator by placing {{subst:DYKproblem|Article|header=yes|sig=yes}} on the nominator's talk page. Instructions for project members[edit] How to promote an accepted hook[edit] At-a-glance instructions on how to promote an approved hook to a Prep area See Wikipedia:Did you know/Preparation areas for details on verifying a hook's acceptability. Promoters should not promote their own nomination or their own review When promoting hooks intended for a particular date, keep in mind that when the number of available approved nominations exceeds 120 we switch to two sets per day, and when that number drops below 60 we return to one set per day. Check list for nomination review completeness 1) Select a hook from the approved nominations page that has one of these ticks at the bottom post: . 2) Check to make sure basic review requirements were completed. a. Any outstanding issue following needs to be addressed before promoting. 3) Check the article history for any substantive changes since it was nominated or reviewed. 4) Images for the lead slot must be freely licensed. Fair-use images are not permitted. Images loaded on Commons that appear on the Main Page are automatically protected by KrinkleBot. 5) Hook must be stated in both the article and source (which must be cited at the end of the article sentence where stated). 6) Hook should make sense grammatically. 7) Try to vary subject matters within each prep area. 8) Try to select a funny, quirky or otherwise upbeat hook for the last or bottom hook in the set. Steps to add a hook to prep In one tab, open the nomination page of the hook you want to promote. In a second tab, open the prep set you intend to add the hook to. 1) For hooks held for specific dates, refer to "Local update times" section on DYK Queue. a. Completed Prep area number sets will be promoted by an administrator to corresponding Queue number. 2) Copy and paste the hook into a chosen slot. a. Make sure there's a space between ... and that, and a ? at the end. b. Check that there's a bold link to the article. 3) If it's the lead (first) hook, paste the image where indicated at the top of the template. 4) Copy and paste ALL the credit information (the {{DYKmake}} and {{DYKnom}} templates) at the bottom 5) Check your work in the prep's Preview mode. a. At the bottom under "Credits", to the right of each article should have the link "View nom subpage" ; if not, a subpage parameter will need to be added to the DYKmake. 6) Save the Prep page. Closing the DYK nomination page At the upper left Change {{DYKsubpage to {{subst:DYKsubpage Change |passed= to |passed=yes At the bottom Just above the line containing }}<!--Please do not write below this line or remove this line. Place comments above this line.--> insert a new, separate line containing one of the following: To [[T:DYK/P1|Prep 1]] To [[T:DYK/P2|Prep 2]] To [[T:DYK/P3|Prep 3]] To [[T:DYK/P4|Prep 4]] To [[T:DYK/P5|Prep 5]] To [[T:DYK/P6|Prep 6]] To [[T:DYK/P7|Prep 7]] Also paste the same thing into the edit summary. Check in Preview mode. Make sure everything is against a pale blue background (nothing outside) and there are no stray characters, like }}, at the top or bottom. Save. For more information, please see T:TDYK#How to promote an accepted hook. Handy copy sources: To [[T:DYK/P1|Prep 1]] To [[T:DYK/P2|Prep 2]] To [[T:DYK/P3|Prep 3]] To [[T:DYK/P4|Prep 4]] To [[T:DYK/P5|Prep 5]] To [[T:DYK/P6|Prep 6]] To [[T:DYK/P7|Prep 7]] How to remove a rejected hook[edit] Open the DYK nomination subpage of the hook you would like to remove. (It's best to wait several days after a reviewer has rejected the hook, just in case someone contests or the article undergoes a large change.) In the window where the DYK nomination subpage is open, replace the line {{DYKsubpage with {{subst:DYKsubpage, and replace |passed= with |passed=no. Then save the page. This has the effect of wrapping up the discussion on the DYK nomination subpage in a blue archive box and stating that the nomination was unsuccessful, as well as adding the nomination to a category for archival purposes. How to remove a hook from the prep areas or queue[edit] Edit the prep area or queue where the hook is and remove the hook and the credits associated with it. Go to the hook's nomination subpage (there should have been a link to it in the credits section). View the edit history for that page Go back to the last version before the edit where the hook was promoted, and revert to that version to make the nomination active again. Add a new icon on the nomination subpage to cancel the previous tick and leave a comment after it explaining that the hook was removed from the prep area or queue, and why, so that later reviewers are aware of this issue. Add a transclusion of the template back to this page so that reviewers can see it. It goes under the date that it was first created/expanded/listed as a GA. You may need to add back the day header for that date if it had been removed from this page. If you removed the hook from a queue, it is best to either replace it with another hook from one of the prep areas, or to leave a message at WT:DYK asking someone else to do so. How to move a nomination subpage to a new name[edit] Don't; it should not ever be necessary, and will break some links which will later need to be repaired. Even if you change the title of the article, you don't need to move the nomination page. Nominations[edit] Older nominations[edit] Articles created/expanded on September 2[edit] Inger K.

(Proposed as a possible alternative by Cavalryman) ALT3:... that Inger K.

Self-nominated at 14:12, 2 September 2021 (UTC). SportsOlympic has been blocked for sockpuppetry. Created by Cavalryman (talk) General: Article is new enough and long enough New Enough: Y Long Enough: Y Policy compliance: Adequate sourcing: N - Several problems here: Sources: "Olympedia – Inger K. Frith". www.olympedia.org. – this source is of questionable reliability. MRS. INGER FRITH, Olympic Review, 1971 – the link doesn’t work for me and there is inadequate bibliographic information for me to verify what it is. "Danish WW2 Pilots | Inger Kristine Frith (née Pragholm) (1909 - 1981)". www.danishww2pilots.dk. – I am satisfied a website run by Mikkel Plannthin about WWII Danish pilots is generally reliable (he has been published writing about this subject matter) but ... this seems to have been written largely from information gained in this forum thread and there is a big disclaimer at the bottom of this article raising some very significant discrepancies within the entry, which are included as fact in the article. Particularly the rank of Captain which never existed in the WAAF. I feel this raises questions about the reliability of the source. "Inger Frith blazed a trail for women in sports governance". www.insidethegames.biz. March 5, 2021. – looks reliable to me. The third paragraph in the WWII section is uncited. Filling more parameters in Template:Cite web, particularly authorship, would go a long way to presentation. Neutral: Y Free of copyright violations, plagiarism, and close paraphrasing: Y Other problems: N - The article misattributes several statements: likely the highest ranked Danish woman in service during the Second World War – the cited source states that she was the highest ranked that the author is aware of. She became a volunteer in the army in Cape Town and was later accepted for the Air Force – the cited source makes no mention of the Army. Hook eligibility: Cited: N - cites two sources with issues as described above Interesting: Y Other problems: N - perhaps base the hook on excellent insidethegames.biz article, something like “ that after serving in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War, Inger K. Frith became the first woman to lead a major international sporting federation and returned archery to the Olympics?” I have added it as a possible alternate above but am happy to play with it. QPQ: N - Not done Overall: I apologise if I seem to have been very harsh and I could be being very finicky, but the article is very clunky to read, with short little sentences and paragraphs that I feel don’t flow very well. Further, there is no such thing as the “British Air Force”, it is the United Kingdom’s air force or the Royal Air Force. Earwig shows 13.8% match to the Plannthin webpage, but I don’t think it breaches the COPYVIO threshold. Also QPQ is required. Cavalryman (talk) 04:08, 3 September 2021 (UTC). Hello @SportsOlympic: this nomination has been sitting here for almost a week and I can see you have not edited the article, nor have you supplied a QPQ. Are you still interested in pursuing the nomination? Cavalryman (talk) 12:56, 9 September 2021 (UTC). Olympedia are the same people as Sports Reference and is states at WP:Sports as reliable. It’s a pitty you can’t open the second source, is has great and reliable content. So the main issue is that it stated that she was Captain and the naming of the British Air Force? I’m not native English, so I can’t write it in high class English. As that is a problem, I can’t improve it to your satisfactions. I will rename the Air Force name and title of Captain because that might me wrong. Next to that, I don’t like your other option: it not mentioned she had a high rank and she was the first female at an sports federation SportsOlympic (talk) 20:24, 9 September 2021 (UTC) I can find no such reference at WP:Sports but perhaps I am missing something, there has only been one discussion at the reliable source noticeboard WP:Reliable sources/Noticeboard/Archive 335#Olympedia, that being said it is not used to cite anything controversial. Whilst you have made a couple of small fixes, you missed some of the nuance in my comments above particularly those points listed in green. Further, the claim in the hook to be high ranked depends upon if the rank of Captain (which is clearly wrong) is supposed to be an Army or a Navy Captain, a Captain in the Army is not high ranked, Navy is getting up there. As it stands I feel this article is not at the standard required to be featured on the main page, but I am happy for others to take a look at it. Cavalryman (talk) 22:38, 9 September 2021 (UTC). I have not looked at the article but would like to confirm that Olympedia is an authoritative source for Olympic bios. Schwede66 18:15, 13 September 2021 (UTC) Schwede66, many thanks, honestly Olympedia is the least of the issues here. Kind regards, Cavalryman (talk) 22:39, 13 September 2021 (UTC). It has been over a week and the nominator has made very little effort to rectify many of the issues raised above, nor have they supplied a QPQ (I was considering donating a QPQ if issues were rectified). They have received a TP notification [1] and been pinged above, so unfortunately I think this should be marked as ineligible and closed. Cavalryman (talk) 00:44, 17 September 2021 (UTC). Hi Cavalryman, I've done considerable cleanup work on the article, finding published sources for a good bit of the material, and rewriting some parts based on the additions. This one should get a whole new review. Mary Mark Ockerbloom (talk) 06:40, 17 September 2021 (UTC) It might need a new hook too: ALT4:... that after serving as a meteorological officer in the Second World War, Inger K.

DONE Capt. Inger Kristine Frith (nee Pragholm) is recorded as being born on 23 January 1909, and having served (W/265733) in the South African Air Force (SAAF) from 23 October 1941 to 21 July 1945 as a meteorologist/forecaster. Extremely awkward, and leading with Captain gives the impression that she was subsequently demoted to Second Lieutenant in the following paragraph. - reworded She and her husband eventually settled in Crowthorne. Sticks out like a sore thumb, maybe move it into the later life section, as in "died in Crowthorne where she and Ronald had established their home."REMOVED In 1985, she was credited as "the main architect of archery's reintroduction to the Olympic programme in 1972." This quote needs in-text attribution. DONE It's getting closer, with some of the issues raised in the first review have still not been resolved, and care needs to taken to ensure the correct source is used to cite certain pieces of information. I have struck ALT0 because we have now clarified that she was not "a high ranked pilot during World War II". Cavalryman (talk) 04:03, 20 September 2021 (UTC). I have also struck my first ALT1 as she did not serve in the RAF but instead served in the SAAF, so have added ALT2, with no preference between it and ALT4. Cavalryman (talk) 00:48, 21 September 2021 (UTC). ALT numbers amended to reflect added ALT3 above. Cavalryman (talk) 21:46, 5 October 2021 (UTC). Unfortunately, Cavalryman, there were two hooks labeled ALT3. I renamed the second one "ALT4", but you should specify whether you were referring to the first ALT3 or the one now called ALT4. MANdARAX • XA?Ab?AM 21:08, 5 October 2021 (UTC) @Mandarax: yes I can see the second ALT3 was added here, I have amended my comment accordingly. Kind regards, Cavalryman (talk) 21:46, 5 October 2021 (UTC). I have copy-edited the article. She served in both the Women's RAF and the SAAF, but I am not sure that the article needs to be held up over debates about her wartime service. I have proposed an alternative that just focuses on her role in sports. The article is worth including in DYK, so I am happy to step in a help get it finished. The sources seem credible to me. Are there other issues left? PMCH2 (talk) 22:46, 26 September 2021 (UTC) Respectfully, not all of the issues raised in the above review have been addressed. Further, then sent to Cairo where she transferred from the SAAF to Great Britain's Women's Royal Air Force, receiving a commission contradicts the preceding paragraph that says she served ... in the South African Air Force (SAAF) from 23 October 1941 to 21 July 1945 and the fact that to have been a Second Lieutenant she must already have been a commissioned officer. Cavalryman (talk) 12:49, 27 September 2021 (UTC). I have added archive links for sources that don't have authors. I removed the one link that didn't work. Others have appropriate details. I have replied above to the concerns I have addressed. I removed the phrase about the commission. I have done my best to address all the issues. PMCH2 (talk) 03:26, 3 October 2021 (UTC) @PMCH2: when I get a chance I will have another detailed look. At a cursory glance, there is still plenty of room to add more bibliographic information to the citations, for instance the www.danishww2pilots.dk source should be: Plannthin, Mikkel (12 September 2010).

Also, a QPQ still has not been provided. Cavalryman (talk) 21:59, 5 October 2021 (UTC). I haven't seen a DYK be scrutinized this closely before in regards to citations. I stepped in to try to help, but it's not my article, and I have spent as much time as I can. You seem to have a very high bar. I don't have a DYK credit to donate. 22:57, 7 October 2021 (UTC) I am sorry you think I am being overly harsh, but I think it is plain sloppy not including proper attribution, and the with the example above I think the fact that the same author is responsible for two cited sources is relevant. I initially reviewed the article because I thought the subject was interesting and worthy of some time in the main page sun. But I too have found it frustrating, I have conducted two complete reviews and even then my findings have not been acted upon, and further still there has been a stunningly consistent lack of attention to detail. I will now do some editing of the article to bring it up to a standard I believe is required. Cavalryman (talk) 01:28, 8 October 2021 (UTC). Thanks for your edits on the article. It reads better and I can see you have cleaned up the sources. I will do a QPQ this weekend, so we can get this over the line.PMCH2 (talk) 12:41, 10 October 2021 (UTC) Many thanks. If you cannot I will try to do one. I also intend to email World Archery to see if we can get a photo. Regards, Cavalryman (talk) 13:13, 10 October 2021 (UTC). I have reviewed Kennin Rebellion for DYK. Thanks for chasing down a photo - that would be great.PMCH2 (talk) 14:03, 12 October 2021 (UTC) Many thanks. Re photo I have been had correspondence with World Archery and they have said we can use the 1961 photo in this article, I am just trying to get them to confirm what license they are happy to release it under. Given I am now responsible for over 70% of the text [2], should a fresh reviewer have a look at this? Cavalryman (talk) 22:10, 12 October 2021 (UTC). After some initial positive correspondence World Archery not responded about licenses for almost a week. I will send one more email but am not holding my breath that a photo will be released. Cavalryman (talk) 22:29, 17 October 2021 (UTC). yeah, I think we're going to need a new reviewer on this one. Cavalryman, given your contributions to getting this article to DYK, I've added you to the credits section. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 20:04, 18 October 2021 (UTC) As best I can tell, the major issues concerning sourcing and attribution have been addressed, and this article seems ready for the main page. Thanks to everyone who contributed to make this work. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 04:54, 20 October 2021 (UTC) @Theleekycauldron: if a photo is released I will ping you to see if you are happy for it to be added to the nomination. Kind regards, Cavalryman (talk) 05:09, 20 October 2021 (UTC). Re photo ... the person I have been corresponding with at World Archery needs to return to the office to confirm their ownership status of this picture, due to covid that cannot occur before 4th November. I request this be held off until then. Cavalryman (talk) 09:50, 20 October 2021 (UTC). @Cavalryman: happy to wait. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 20:23, 21 October 2021 (UTC) Any updates on the image? If we waiting just for the image, I'll suggest to let this nomination run without an image. – Kavyansh.Singh (talk) 08:03, 30 October 2021 (UTC) As said above I do not expect any word before the 4th of November. If there is a chronic shortage of articles for DYK then by all means run this, but it would be a shame to potentially deny this most capable woman a face when she is featured for the sake of a week. Cavalryman (talk) 10:08, 31 October 2021 (UTC). There is no shortage of hooks on DYK. I was just concerned about how backlogged this particular nomination is. If it is worth waiting for the image, no issues then. – Kavyansh.Singh (talk) 10:19, 31 October 2021 (UTC) I have just received this in an email from World Archery: I checked last Thursday in our old history books, but there is no mention of photographer there. However, I'm on another track that was given to me by the author of another book on the history of our federation, but I'll have to check it out this Thursday when I'm again in the office. Things are in progress, and I should be able to give you some good news by next week! If everyone is happy to wait a few more days hopefully we’ll have a photo. Cavalryman (talk) 08:07, 8 November 2021 (UTC). @Cavalryman: Any updates? I think this should get promoted within a week if an image doesn't materialize. Side note to @BlueMoonset: original nom has been blocked for socking, do they still get a credit? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 05:13, 17 November 2021 (UTC) theleekycauldron, I'm trying to remember. Why don't you ask at WT:DYK and see whether there are any recollections about past cases, or strong opinions either way. Sorry I can't be more definitive. On the matter of promoting, the nomination will be three months old on December 2, and should have been promoted prior to then. BlueMoonset (talk) 05:30, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I see Wikipedia talk:Did you know/Archive 152#Multiple DYK nominations in process by newly checkuser-blocked sockpuppet: how to proceed?, which ended up with every nom made by the sock being rejected. Since this one's been adopted, We shouldn't close this nom, it's been adopted, but I am striking their credit. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 05:46, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Apologies, I was going to give an update this morning (Australian time). I had an email overnight from World Archery wanting to clarify the process of uploading a picture, I wouldn’t mind betting there will be an email with photo attached in the inbox at permissions@wikimedia.org tomorrow Swiss time. I agree, if there is no image within a week promote it, this has been a lengthy process. Cavalryman (talk) 06:03, 17 November 2021 (UTC).

[3] ALT3:... that Sarawak was the world's largest exporter of tropical timber in the 1980s, contributing greatly to the state's economy at the time?[4] Created/expanded by Cerevisae (talk). Self-nominated at 08:59, 29 September 2021 (UTC). The article needs copyediting first. In addition, the table in the article is mostly empty. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 11:42, 12 October 2021 (UTC) Thanks for your suggestion. Table moved to sandbox for further expansion. Cerevisae (talk) 13:35, 17 October 2021 (UTC) @Narutolovehinata5: I have carried out some copyedits, let me know if there are areas that need another run-through. CMD (talk) 07:59, 24 October 2021 (UTC) Apologies for the late reply! Anyway, ALT0 is probably the best hook among the three proposed (ALT1 seems unimpressive to me while ALT2 may need additional context). However, the sentence verifying ALT0 doesn't have a footnote; instead, the references for it are spread across other nearby sentences instead, duplication is needed here for DYK purposes. In addition, it may be a good idea to propose an additional hook about Sarawak being the biggest timber exporter in the 1980s since that fact seems more interesting than the others discussed here. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 06:53, 1 November 2021 (UTC) added ALT 3. Cerevisae (talk) 04:30, 5 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you for the proposal; however, I feel that it may not meet WP:EGG. Would it be possible to rewrite ALT3 to make the link to "Economy of Sarawak" clearer? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 06:52, 5 November 2021 (UTC) talk, ALT 3 changed. Cerevisae (talk) 14:23, 8 November 2021 (UTC) ALT3 reads better, but it may still need to be copyedited for grammar. In addition it lacks a bold link to the DYK article subject. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:29, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Hook copyedited. CMD (talk) 07:03, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you for the edits. Now the article was new enough and long enough at the time of the nomination and no close paraphrasing was found. However, there are still a number of outstanding issues. Firstly, the sentence that mentions the main hook fact is lacking a footnote, with the relevant reference instead coming at the end of the paragraph where the fact is located at; duplication is necessary here per DYK rules. Secondly, the article doesn't say that the timber industry contributed "greatly" to Sarawak's economy: I would suggest deleting the word "greatly" from the hook, with the rest of that part being accepted as it's implied by the rest of the article. Thirdly, a QPQ has yet to be provided; this was the nominator's sixth nomination, so a QPQ should have been provided at the time of the nomination or within a week of then.

General eligibility: New Enough: Y Long Enough: Y Other problems: Y Policy compliance: Adequate sourcing: Y Neutral: Y Free of copyright violations, plagiarism, and close paraphrasing: Y Other problems: Y Hook eligibility: Cited: N - Source is offline but happy to AGF. However, in the article the statement “they considered German lands too poor for annexation” is sourced to p.204 of Wells. pp.206-7 referred to above is used to support that they that “it was too costly in economic and military resources” to go into in Germany. I guess either way the hook is sourced but could you clarify the exact sourcing of the hook. Interesting: Y QPQ: None required. Overall: Interesting thorough article, well-written with good quality sourcing. Earwig shows no issues. Just a minor query around the hook sourcing but otherwise will be good to go. DeCausa (talk) 08:23, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @DeCausa: I found the web link that (for me) shows a preview if you're able to see it: https://books.google.com/books?id=mc30CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA206&lpg=PA206 SpartaN (talk) 10:07, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @SpartaN: Thanks for providing the link. It’s prompted a couple of thoughts for me. Firstly, Wells doesn’t seem to be saying the reason for the withdrawal is definitively known (“… the reasons for these decisions must have lain…”) i.e he’s making an assumption, however well founded. The hook is more definite than Wells is. Secondly, Wells’ emphasis is on the strength of the resistance being behind the reason - the poor value of the territory makes it “not worth it” because of the strength of the resistance. That’s not quite the same as just saying the land wasn’t valuable. (I notice the text you used in the article on this reflects that effort/value ratio issue.) To fix both points would you be prepared to consider an ALT1 which after “…Teutoburg” continues something along the lines of “…likely decided to leave Germany because the military effort was out of proportion to the territory’s value?” although there may need to be some trimming to get it into the 200 character limit. DeCausa (talk) 11:12, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @SpartaN and DeCausa: It's been over a month since the last comments here, have there been any updates? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:31, 13 November 2021 (UTC) From my point of view I’m waiting for SpartaN’s reply to my last post here. But I notice they haven’t edited Wikipedia since then, over a month ago. So I’m not quite sure what can be done. DeCausa (talk) 08:17, 13 November 2021 (UTC) I see. Given that there's really only one issue holding the nomination back, would anyone be willing to adopt this in case SpartaN doesn't return? It would be a shame if the nomination failed at this point. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 06:35, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I’m not sure what exactly are the DYK rules on this but, subject to that, options could be (a) I propose an ALT1 hook and someone else signs it off; (b) someone else proposes an ALT1 hook and I sign it off; (c) if anyone disagrees with me on the original hook I’m happy to step away and they sign it off. DeCausa (talk) 11:04, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I've looked at the Wells source and concur that it is saying the withdrawal was more down to the ratio of effort required to potential reward, and have boldly tweaked the copy in the article to reflect this. For what it's worth, I think ALT1 works just fine. firefly ( t · c ) 11:16, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Ok. I’m just going to formalize the ALT1 and let someone else add the tick and sign off: ALT1:... that the Romans won a series of campaigns against the Germanic tribes after the disaster at Teutoburg but likely decided to leave Germany as the effort was out of proportion to the territory’s value? DeCausa (talk) 12:07, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Since the reviewer has proposed a new hook, another editor will be needed to sign this off. I'm not sure though if the section linking in the bold links is allowed, however. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:29, 15 November 2021 (UTC) sorry, I missed that. It’s not even necessary to link to a section of the article so I’ve taken it out of ALT1.

Self-nominated at 11:39, 5 October 2021 (UTC). – The article is long enough (16,688 characters) and new enough (created on October 4, 2021). It cites various sources, and Earwig's Copyvio detector shows 29.1% similarity (violation unlikely). But ... It has few neutrality issues including a neutrality tag. The hook seems fine, and maybe cited in the article. Can we have a source here? Rest, a QPQ has been done. Till the neutrality concerns are resolved, this DYK nomination should be on hold. – Kavyansh.Singh (talk) 06:57, 20 October 2021 (UTC) Kavyansh.Singh I rewrote the disputed section based on more reliable sources. Unfortunately, it was reverted immediately by ?Khirurg who appears to think that the New York Times is not a reliable source. Perhaps they would explain here why they object. (t · c) buidhe 03:05, 24 October 2021 (UTC) Yeah you rewrote it alright - by removing a whole bunch of sources. Maybe you can explain why AP is not reliable source? Perhaps you can also explain why you removed the POV tag, even though your edit did not address any of the issues raised in the talkpage? Khirurg (talk) 03:07, 24 October 2021 (UTC) Khirurg : Hi, I don't think the AP source supports the content it's cited for. The AP source reports that Greece has made certain accusations, it doesn't say whether they are correct or not. I'm not sure how Greek accusations against Turkey (regardless of whether they are correct or not) have any bearing about this article, which is about Greece. Cleanup tags should be removed unless there is active discussion ongoing and the person placing it can substantiate that there is a problem with the article. (t · c) buidhe 03:14, 24 October 2021 (UTC) Not only you removed AP news, you also removed the Brussels International Center. Your edits made the article even more POV, by trying to spin away the hostile actions of the Turkish government. And it's not a "cleanup tag", it's POV tag, and there is very much an active discussion going on, first of all right here. If you are avoiding the article talkpage and spin that "no discussion ongoing", that's not going to work. Khirurg (talk) 03:23, 24 October 2021 (UTC) Khirurg Actually I have no opinion on the reliability of BIC at this point, but I hesitate to cite think tanks when there are better sources available (I cited the New York Times, Verfassungsblog and an academic paper, all of which are higher quality than a think tank). I checked several sources and all of them mention that the main change in February-March 2020 was opening the border to migrants, some also mention that Turkey bussed migrants to the border or that at least one incident of coercing migrants was reported. Your wording suggests that all or many migrants since then were coerced to travel to Greece. This is misleading because few if any reliable sources support coercive "push" tactics being a widespread or systematic practice by Turkey at its border with Greece. (t · c) buidhe 04:02, 24 October 2021 (UTC) Not only is BIC itself a perfectly reliable source (much more so than the partisan NGOs you have filled the article with), but it's really not hard to find sources about the Turkish government coercing migrants to the border [3]. This assume of course that one in inclined to look for sources, instead of pretending they don't exist. And here [4] (and then doubled down [5], you seem to have followed me to a Requested Move I recently participated in, in what appears to be clear WP:HOUND behavior. So everyone can see what's going on here. Khirurg (talk) 00:47, 25 October 2021 (UTC) Okay, coming back to the DYK criteria, this seems to meet everything except the neutrality issues. I see that there has been no active discussion on the talk page form at-least 17 days. @Buidhe Any updates on @Khirurg's concerns? I can' formally approve this until the neutrality concerns are resolved. – Kavyansh.Singh (talk) 16:28, 25 October 2021 (UTC) @Kavyansh.Singh, Buidhe, and Khirurg: this nomination should probably be closed if the neutrality concerns are not resolved one way or another. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 01:21, 10 November 2021 (UTC) Great, now you can filibuster DYKs you don't like by raising spurious "concerns" and inserting loaded language. (t · c) buidhe 01:34, 10 November 2021 (UTC) What "loaded language"? I raised my concerns in the talkpage, and you've done nothing but edit-war since then. Khirurg (talk) 01:54, 10 November 2021 (UTC) The most egregiously loaded language I recall was a human rights violation that encapsulates a will to eliminate a person’s presence on the face of the planet, which was added by you. Khirurg (talk) 02:02, 10 November 2021 (UTC) You insist on inserting loaded language like "Weaponization of migration" and "coercive engineered migration" which simply do not reflect the majority reliable sources (and are only tangentially related to the article topic, because they are accusations against Turkey rather than Greece) as explained above. I explained that you have misrepresented sources as seen above, and substituted opinion pieces for news coverage and peer-reviewed academic papers, and all you do is revert. So it's unclear to me how any progress can be made here. (t · c) buidhe 02:07, 10 November 2021 (UTC) Everything I have added is sourced to reliable sources. As far as opinion pieces, you're the one that has added those, such as this opinion piece written by grad students [6]. You haven't made the slightest effort to meet me halfway, instead you just blanket-revert all my additions claiming "my sources are better than yours". No attempt at dispute resolution, just blanket reverts like this [7]. The article is mainly based on activist NGO sources. Yes, there can be no progress under these conditions. Khirurg (talk) 02:45, 10 November 2021 (UTC) You literally replaced a news article from the New York Times and academic paper with an opinion piece from The Hill regarding the March 2020 escalation in order to replace fact-based description with loaded language of "weaponization". I did not cite any opinion pieces in the article, and it's a lie to say that the article is "mainly based on activist NGO sources". (t · c) buidhe 03:37, 10 November 2021 (UTC) (Personal attack removed). I just linked to an opinion piece you put in the article in my previous post. InfoMigrants, Mare Liberum, Aegean Boat Report are all activist NGOs used as references (to name just a few). The only way to resolve this is through some form of third party mediation. Would you be agreeable to something like that, yes or no? Khirurg (talk) 04:01, 10 November 2021 (UTC) That's simply untrue, InfoMigrants is a journalism outfit based on a media partnership, not a NGO let alone an "activist" one, and the EJIL Talk piece is expert analysis, not from their editorial section. As for third party mediation, sure why not? But I can't see the use in repeating points that were ignored the first time. (t · c) buidhe 12:11, 10 November 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: imho, the best way to break a filibuster is the old fashioned way: cloture motion. I'd recommend that you get as many eyes on this as possible, see if a clearer consensus falls out. my confidence in either of you conceding your point is dwindling, so this back-and-forth seems unhelpful, as you both pointed out. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 08:52, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Articles created/expanded on October 9[edit] Pankratius Pfeiffer ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that Salvatorian priest Pankratius Pfeiffer saved hundreds of Jews in Rome during the Second World War? Reviewed: 1936 Northeast Flood Created by Ergo Sum (talk). Self-nominated at 17:52, 9 October 2021 (UTC). New article that was created on 9 October 2021? is 3,212 characters and nominated on the same day. No copyvios detected and duplication detector of [8][9][10][11][12] reveal no close paraphrasing issues (AGF PDF docs which can't go through Dup detector). Article is well-sourced. Hook is 103 characters long (under 200 character max.) and is interesting. Refs 4 and 5 (verifying the hook) are reliable sources. QPQ done. Looks good to go! —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:41, 9 October 2021 (UTC) Too many red flags here. If he really saved hundreds of Jews, you would expect plenty of confirmation of this in scholarly sources and him to be recognized by Yad Vashem. I can't count the number of times that I've seen mainstream newspapers print completely false stories about Jews being rescued during the holocaust, so better sources are definitely needed to confirm these extraordinary claims. Thanks Brigade Piron for letting me know about this. (t · c) buidhe 16:51, 10 October 2021 (UTC) I have to admit I'm just a bit perplexed by the argument. Except in fairly uncommon cases of multiple RS that contradict each other, we don't generally recognize any "hierarchy" of reliable sources. Sources are either RS or they are not. So I'm not sure what kind of sources you have in mind as "better" sources. The ones currently cited in the article are all RS, so that should be the end of it. I might add that if you seek some manner of official imprimatur in the vein of Yad Vashem, the City of Rome named a street after him. Your point about why there isn't more extensive coverage of this historical figure is well taken but can easily be attributed to the fact that all manner of historical figures are lost to history, especially those who are notable really for one major event in their life that did not come to light until years later, as is the case here. Indeed, one of the RS in this article describes Pfeiffer as being "lost to history." I'm adding the new review icon here so that we can get at least one more editor's evaluation of this. Ergo Sum 13:32, 16 October 2021 (UTC) There are very few people who actually saved hundreds of Jews during the Holocaust and plenty of hoaxes that were reported as truth by various news organizations—for example Necdet Kent. In other cases, actual rescue did occur but the numbers are greatly exaggerated and repeated uncritically by news organizations, such as Raoul Wallenberg. If the story is true you would expect to see it covered in many more credible sources. There are plenty of cases where a source is reliable for some info but not others. For example, someone's CV is often reliable for "they worked at X organization" but not "they are a world expert in Z". Extraordinary claims require extraordinary sourcing. (t · c) buidhe 21:27, 16 October 2021 (UTC) I should say that I share Buidhe's concerns. I think saying that "all manner of historical figures are lost to history" rather side-steps the sheer volume of historical scholarship on all aspects of the Holocaust. On a more banal note, I think part of the problem is that the sources cited are, essentially, all journalistic sources published by explicitly Catholic or Salvatorian outlets. The specific sources cited for the "saved" claim are Romereports (I am not familiar with this outlet, but the typo in the video does not inspire confidence) and a self-published Salvatorian newsletter. Neither are scholarly sources and both are, again, explicitly confessional in nature. I think WP:BIASED may on point in a highly sensitive issue touching on the wider disputes about Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust. Do we know what the Samerski book says, for example? —Brigade Piron (talk) 08:55, 17 October 2021 (UTC) Buidhe It is true that the sources cover Catholic issues, but only the Salvatorian one is actually published by a Catholic institution. I need not go into how varied Catholic newspapers are in their adherence/faithfulness to the Catholic hierarchy and beliefs (see e.g. National Catholic Reporter versus National Catholic Register). But more direclty, there actually are many scholarly RS that discussion Pfeiffer and his works in Nazi-occupied Rome. You will find them on the other language versions of this article. The problem is that I do not read Italian or German well enough to use them in the article. Coverage is not the issue. It is English language coverage. Ergo Sum 13:48, 17 October 2021 (UTC) @Ergo Sum: perhaps add the word "reportedly" before "saved". I'm inclined to accept in good faith the sources used as reliable – none of them have not been deprecated nor deemed generally unreliable. —Bloom6132 (talk) 16:41, 26 October 2021 (UTC) DYK should not cover unconfirmed reports or rumors so I strongly disagree with that suggestion. As well as assuming sources are reliable if they've never been discussed at WP:RSN, which disregards important parts of WP:RS such as WP:CONTEXTMATTERS. There is no issue with citing sources in Italian or German, but if it's not confirmed that they support the content then it's incorrect to assume that they do. (t · c) buidhe 20:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Bloom6132: I tend to think that statements are either supported by RS and written in wikivoice or they're not accepted at all. For that reason, I shy away from words like "reportedly." I reiterate though that I think it's quite clear there's nothing wrong with the sources currently used. They're all RS, so that should be the end of it. Hence, why I think your initial review was satisfactory. Ergo Sum 23:40, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Ergo Sum: agreed. I'm still of the view that the hook satisfies criteria 3b. Criteria 4 states that "Nominations should be rejected if an inspection reveals that they are not based on reliable sources". That is not the case here. —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) You're still ignoring the principle in RS that context matters, and some sources are reliable for some but not other info. The two of us who actually write on Holocaust related topics have expressed that the sources cited are not reliable for the exceptional claims being made. (t · c) buidhe 23:59, 26 October 2021 (UTC) With all due respect, I am of the opinion that the sources used are reliable for the info in the hook. The fact that you and Brigade Piron write on Holocaust-related topics is irrelevant – it does not confer a veto over hooks pertaining to that subject. By that logic, I should be able to veto baseball or heraldry hooks ... —Bloom6132 (talk) 01:10, 27 October 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: Three of my DYKs promoted (including Coat of arms of the Falkland Islands from August this year) have included the word "reportedly" in the hook, as well as numerous hooks from other editors. Disagree all you want – this is accepted practice at DYK. —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: I'm aware that you have experience writing about Holocaust-related articles and I put value in your assessment as a solid editor. However, I'm quite comfortable in my ability to vet RS, as well, and my confidence in these sources means I must disagree with your opinion here. Experienced editors do disagree at times, and it is my opinion that I think you have gotten this one wrong; doubtless, you think the same for me. I haven't seen any evidence that these are not RS. Therefore, I recommend if Bloom6132 is inclined to do so, to renew their approval of the hook. In the meantime, I'm going to request the input of additional experienced editors on the DYK talk page. Ergo Sum 01:28, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm going to ping @Bamse, Bermicourt, Jmabel, and Anyfile to see if we can find some reliable sources in other languages. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 01:46, 27 October 2021 (UTC) Oops, @AnyFile theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 01:47, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm currently traveling & very busy, so not much help here, I'm afraid. - Jmabel | Talk 01:53, 27 October 2021 (UTC) That said, more or less this same case is made in The Pope's Jews: The Vatican's Secret Plan to Save Jews from the Nazis by Gordon Thomas (not currently cited in the article). - Jmabel | Talk 02:00, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm unclear as to why the cited sources are unreliable: are we assuming that all information emanating from a Roman Catholic source is unreliable? If so what's the logic? In any case there are dozens of book sources in English, German, French and Italian that mention Pfeiffer, the problem is that few are accessible online. One is an entire biography of Pfeiffer "from baker to Vatican diplomat" which would be useful to track down: Willer, Philomena (2005). P. Pankratius Pfeiffer SDS: (1872-1945); vom Bäckergesellen zum Vatikandiplomat. Pub: Josef Fink. Others that mentions Pfeiffer and the Jews in Rome are: Liebhart (1996) Schwangau. Meding (1992), Flucht vor Nürnberg. Sinn (1976), Illegal. Bermicourt (talk) 08:41, 27 October 2021 (UTC) My issue is with the unreliability of journalistic works and popular history, which have in many cases published inaccurate information about rescues of Jews during the Holocaust. If better sources exist, they should be cited instead. An additional question is, do these sources actually support the claim of "hundreds" of Jews rescued by Pfeiffer personally? (t · c) buidhe 08:51, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I've now found sources that cover most of the article. Here are more: Liebhart (1996) Schwangau. Meding (1992), Flucht vor Nürnberg. Sinn (1976), Illegal. Prince Constantine of Bavaria (1952) Der Papst. Layer (1985), Schwäbisches Ehrenbuch - Pfeiffer credited with "saving Rome and other Italian cities including Chieti, Ascoli and Ovieto from destruction and other calamities" _ (1999). Publik-Forum - Pfeiffer the only German to have a street named after him in Rome and who fought to save Roman Jews. _ (1960). Bayerische Frömmigkeit - Pfeiffer described as the "Saviour of Rome and other cities in Italy" Robert Katz has written a number of books - Death in Rome (1967), Black Sabbath (1969), The Battle for Rome (2010) - which all mention Pfeiffer. Bottum and Dalin (2004). The Pius War has this interesting piece: "7. Pancrazio [sic] Pfeiffer. According to Carroll-Abbing, one of the men used by Pius XII to protest the Nazi roundup of Rome's Jews and intervene for persecuted victims was Father Pancrazio Pfeiffer, superior general of the Salvatorian Fathers, who also served as Pius XII' personal liaison to the German military command in Rome. Because Pfeiffer died tragically in an automobile accident toward the end of the war and thus never took part in the postwar analysis of Pius XII's conduct, many historians have overlooked him. But those who knew him or have researched his life have chronicled his collaborative efforts with Pius XII to rescue Jews and others during the war. See the article "Pfeiffer's List" by Robert Graham, 30 Days, June 1994, pp. 42-46. Prince Constantine of Bavaria's book on Pius XII, The Pope (London: Allan Wingate, 1954) [listed above] contains an excellent section on Pfeiffer, whom he describes as an agent for the pope on behalf of the victims of persecution and the fugitives in hiding" (p. 213). At Pfeiffer's death in May 1945, Vatican Radio paid tribute: "He came into contact with the Commander of the German occupying forces [in Rome in 1943-44]. From that day onwards, he placed his religious and spiritual qualities at the service of many who had been arrested or already condemned to death. He helped countless people in this way, and saved their lives, among them many Jews and other Italian personages. He championed..." In short there seems to be book evidence for virtually everything stated in the article apart from the specific details of the two incidents where 249 or 400 Jews were rescued. Based on my initial searches my expectation is that those incidents are likely to be recorded in the literature - we just need to be able to access more of the sources. Meanwhile there is no harm in pausing to use some of the above sources, plus those I've added to the Further reading section of the article in order to reinforce the existing references and then review where we are.

For example, Salvatorians USA Province is not independent of the article subject and therefore is not reliable for self-serving assertions such as "he saved many Jews in Rome from persecution and ultimately death" or "Every day, Pfeiffer visited the Regina Coeli prison and another prison on Via Tasso, where he would often return with freed prisoners who had been sentenced to death." (t · c) buidhe 08:27, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: would you still object if the article instead relied on the sources found by Bermicourt? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 04:58, 5 November 2021 (UTC) Depends, the Samerski source looks reliable to me but the book published by "Österreichische Provinz der Salvatorianer" has the same issue of close connection to the article subject. (t · c) buidhe 06:27, 5 November 2021 (UTC) All right. @Ergo Sum: I'm not going to promote the nomination without consensus to move forward, so if you want to try and rework the article's sourcing to approval, that can work.

This slipped my mind completely this weekend. I will deal with this tonight. Ergo Sum 15:45, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I have added several inline citations to the article, which refer to sources that were (very helpfully) added by Bermicourt. These sources support several of the very specific claims in the article, as well as the general thrust of the article which is in dispute here, namely that Pfeiffer was a liaison and in that capacity saved many Jews and others from the Nazis. In light of these reliable sources supporting the general claims, I think any concern about the pre-existing ones describing some of his more specific actions is ameliorated. There is a trove of additional sources in the Further Reading section that additionally describe in much greater detail Pfeiffer's actions but they are either in a foreign language which I do not adequately read to make use of as citations or are offline. All being said, I think there is now ample sourcing to back up the article's claims. Ergo Sum 05:49, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks, Ergo Sum—@Buidhe:, if this sourcing is up to your standards, we can move ahead. If not, we're probably going back to WT:DYK and asking for more eyes. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 05:52, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Hi, I've flagged the specific content in the article that supports the hook as needing a better source. There are other active cleanup tags on the article as well. However, I think there's sufficient sourcing for a modified version of the hook without the words "hundreds of". (t · c) buidhe 06:06, 17 November 2021 (UTC) We could cite "countless" using the ref above instead of "hundreds of". Bermicourt (talk) 08:33, 17 November 2021 (UTC) According to the source it's what Vatican Radio said about him after his death. DYK is not for eulogies imo. (t · c) buidhe 08:37, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I'm not following—is the source unreliable because it's after his death? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 08:40, 17 November 2021 (UTC) No, it's because it's Catholic presumably... We could always add "according to Vatican Radio..." But better still, we just need to cite the exact text from one of the many non-Catholic book sources and the problem will be solved. Bermicourt (talk) 08:46, 17 November 2021 (UTC) And yet another source: O'Reilly (2001) in Forgotten Battles: Italy's War of Liberation 1943-45 states that "the Vatican was able to assist many of Rome's Jews and others sought by the Germans through Father Pancrazio Pfeiffer's intervention with the Germans... His work was recounted by Robert Graham who has written extensively on the Vatican's role in World War II." Bermicourt (talk) 09:01, 17 November 2021 (UTC) And another: Bartley (2016) in Catholics Confronting Hitler states that "Father Pancrace [sic] Pfeiffer, a German priest and the superior general of the Salvatorian Order, was the pope's liaison with the German military. Several hundred hostages, including some under sentence of death, owed their release to the efficacious intervention of Father Pfeiffer." I don't know why I'm doing this - you can look up the references yourselves instead of opining and speculating from the sidelines in the classic Wikipedia way. :) Bermicourt (talk) 09:08, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @Bermicourt: Since it seems you have access to several sources that I do not (probably just requires further digging), would you want to add them as inline citations with page numbers, especially to support the proposition regarding hundreds of people saved?

I'd be in favor instead of the hook being split into two separate proposals: one hook about the fact that she was an internet celebrity who grew up in a place without tap water, and a separate hook about her going viral for making hamburgers. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:23, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Full review needed, which can also address the issue of the borderline ALT1 hook. BlueMoonset (talk) 04:23, 5 November 2021 (UTC) As far as I can tell the article meets DYK requirements, and a QPQ has been done. Earwigs finds a close match with Coda Media, but that's only because it was the source for quotes in the article, and all of them are properly referenced. I find the first hook hard to believe given China's international standing, and in any case as brought up by Bowlhover may be inaccurate anyway. As for the second hook, as I mentioned before it's ineligible as it's exactly 200 characters long, and per WP:DYK hooks that are at or shorter than 200 characters may be rejected per reviewer's discretion. Both ALT0 and ALT1 have struck: I am repeating my earlier suggestion that ALT1 instead be split into two separate hooks. As this is a China-related article and there appear to be some political discussion in the article, I'd also like to ask for a second opinion from someone more knowledgeable about China-related articles if the article doesn't fall afoul of relevant guidelines. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 13:12, 6 November 2021 (UTC) From Wikipedia:Did you know#The hook: The hook should be concise: no more than about 200 characters (including spaces and the question mark, but not including the ..., the space immediately following the ..., or any (pictured)). While 200 is a hard limit, hooks near or at this limit may still be rejected at the discretion of reviewers and administrators. This tool can be used for counting words. The guideline says that "200 is a hard limit", so it is not true that the 200-character ALT1 hook is "ineligible" or "simply too long". No reason has been given for rejecting a 200-character hook "at the discretion of reviewers". Here are two additional hooks based on the suggestion: ALT2: ... that Dianxi Xiaoge, who grew up in a remote Yunnan mountain without running water, is an Internet celebrity with roughly 16 million subscribers on all her platforms? ALT3: ... Dianxi Xiaoge went viral in China and internationally after making hamburgers for her grandparents who had never eaten them before? Cunard (talk) 07:48, 7 November 2021 (UTC) Well for one thing, the original was very difficult to read and seemed to combine too many facts into one hook. Usually DYK prefers simpler hooks whenever possible. In any case, I think ALT3 is the best hook here and the nomination is otherwise good to go, I'd just like to hear a second opinion from another editor on the article tone given that I'm a bit uncomfortable doing a solo review here given the "Commentary" section delves into some political matters. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:36, 7 November 2021 (UTC) On second thought, I have some concerns regarding the length of the article. Isn't it rather detailed for an internet celebrity's page? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 11:10, 7 November 2021 (UTC) That the article is "rather detailed for an internet celebrity's page" should not be a concern. The sources provided substantial analysis of her and her work, and this article reflects those sources. Other detailed articles for Internet celebrities include PewDiePie and MrBeast. Cunard (talk) 11:18, 7 November 2021 (UTC) Pinging Gatoclass for his input, as he responded to a discussion I raised about this nomination over at WT:DYK. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:57, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I don't think we need Gatoclass to restate themself. Here's what they said at WT:DYK: The article doesn't use the phrase "one of only three Chinese influencers to gain international influence", so I'm not sure where you got that, but it does say she is one of only three "Chinese Internet celebrities who have reached international prominence", and the problem with that claim is that it's sourced to an article that is two years old and therefore not up-to-date. With regard to the overall length, I would agree that it is overly detailed and could use a trim. I'm not sure this is relevant to DYK however, as "overly detailed" is not one of our criteria. What I would say is that the level of detail does raise the chances of close paraphrasing so the article would need to be carefully checked for that. Anybody else with an opinion on this article?

Thriley (talk) 20:57, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @Thriley: I'll ping BlueMoonset here in case I'm wrong, but I'm going to say no, it isn't. My reasoning here is that if the hook were read as plaintext, without any bolding or linking, it would be read as pretty much only interesting as it concerns the plot. The hook should concern Smit's life; if it concerns her work as an actress, only stating her role and not anything about production doesn't make the hook out-of-universe. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 21:28, 17 November 2021 (UTC) theleekycauldron, I was taking a look at the ALT1 hook and its sources, and the second Biography sentence is basically copied from Esquire—the Google translate version, at any rate. That's a problem. Another problem is that the source doesn't actually say that she was working as a hotel receptionist when she got the call, just that it was "one of these jobs", referring back to the four in the previous sentence, none of which were hotel receptionist. The article also needs a bit of copyediting. I don't think that either of the plot-based hooks should be used, and as Drmies notes, "first film" is not accurate, since it's Cross the Line that's in the source, which appears to be her fifth film. We could only use "first feature film" if the previous four in her filmography were all short films (which would need to be clearly sourced). Perhaps an angle for the information in ALT1 would be to say she was working in whatever job it was when she was cast in Cross the Line, for which she was nominated as best new actress in the Goya Awards.

Particularly with "Conflict with Miles and Reynolds", there's four citations crammed at the end of the section.

Nice addition. well done Victuallers (talk) 10:31, 6 November 2021 (UTC) Reopening this because I think the hook is misleading, as according to the source it was usual for women of the nobility, like Neville, to sign with their own names.

So the hooks are misleading.

(Someone shouts) "BUT all British Queens do that!!" (Someone shouts) "That implies that it was unusual for Queens to sign with just their first name." No it doesnt. I think @Gatoclass: is reading the source and then saying that the hook doesnt explain every piece of information in the source... which obviously it doesnt. Its unusual that "a woman" is doing this at all. It WAS unusual for women in the fourteenth century to sign and if they did then they did not usually use just their own name. Its a fact - its unusual. Did You know that women did not sign their own names on documents in the 14th century? No I didnt. That is something that Lajmmoore wrote about and now I know. Thanks. Victuallers (talk) 08:28, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Hello Gatoclass all so the part of the source I was using is this, which is talking about signatures for charitable donation "Although most of the widows declare themselves to be the wife of their late husband, or their father's daughter, others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names, such as 'domina Margareta de Longvl' and 'don-ýina Margareta de Nevill' (the same person). The majority of widows declare that their marital status and their power to act, using a variety of phrases, including 'in pura viduitate', 'in pura viduitate mea et ligia potestate', and 'in viduitate mea propria et potestate legitima' ..." and I read that as it was more usual for (noble) women to use a signature that described them as "wife of, etc..." I read the passage as Legg using Margaret de Neville as an unusual example. Legg is talking about the Coucher Book signatures specifically, but I still think they are marking out unusual practice. In terms of the hook, I wonder whether changing 'woman' to 'literate woman' might work? Lajmmoore (talk) 09:32, 19 November 2021 (UTC) No, it wouldn't work just to add "literate". And your reading of the text just amounts to an unsupported assumption on your part. Because while the text could admittedly be less ambiguous, the statement that others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names does not in any way suggest that it was rare or unusual for a member of the nobility to give their name, it only states that members of the nobility as a class were inclined to give their names. So there isn't sufficient support in that statement for a hook which implies that Neville's act was in any way unusual for a member of her class. The hook makes Neville sound like some sort of proto-feminist who boldly challenged the system, when the underlying source only indicates that either her entire class did the same thing, or at least that it was an accepted practice for members of the nobility. So I still think that either the hook needs to be substantially reworked to more closely reflect the source, or a new hook be found. Gatoclass (talk) 02:53, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks for sharing your interpretation of your text Gatoclass. My interpretation (& so the hook) is based on Legg's use of the word most - in that "most of the widows declare themselves to be the wife of their late husband, or their father's daughter" and you rightly point out "others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names" but I think that needs to be balanced by the "most" earlier in the sentence i.e. for women generally, they don't give their name, but some noble women do but overall, for women signing their name, it is unusual enough to be pointed out in the text.

Whispyhistory (talk) 06:32, 13 November 2021 (UTC) I don't see that exact sequence of numbers in the source, although there are others that look a bit like an IP address. The trouble is, the nominator seems to be the source for it looking a bit like an IP address, which it does, but we can't use that unless the source makes a similar point, which it does not appear to do.

I don't see how the hook you're suggesting is hooky. What exactly is wrong with the hook proposed? It's in the article and it's supported by the sources cited. And the image is directly related to the hook. It engages the reader into a spotting game. Dr. Vogel (talk) 14:57, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Like everyone else, I rather like the IP-address hook. If we wikilinked IP address, it would be supported in the linked articles, and fulfill the requirement that anyone following the links will be able to verify the hook. I don't think we need sourcing that says that a specific sequence of numbers is an IP address, as we have sources giving the general format of an IP address, and creating an example would be a trivial calculation ("Are all four of these numbers separated by periods in the range 0-255?"): "IPv4 and IPv6 address formats". www.ibm.com. An IPv4 address has the following format: x . x . x . x where x is called an octet and must be a decimal value between 0 and 255. Octets are separated by periods. An IPv4 address must contain three periods and four octets. The following examples are valid IPv4 addresses: 1 . 2 . 3 . 4 01 . 102 . 103 . 104 This hook is better than any alternative I can think of, and I don't see anything likely to be problematic about it (it's certainly verifiable). I think we might be in agreement on that? So if some rule technically prohibits it, we might have a good case for applying the WP:Ignore all the rules policy. Broken finger is also currently DYK-eligible and I think it uses the same numbering scheme.[1] HLHJ (talk) 02:07, 14 November 2021 (UTC) [edit: add fulltext url] I don't necessarily agree with the reading of WP:DYKCRIT 3b ( Each fact in the hook must be supported in the article by at least one inline citation to a reliable source [...]) that says that the IP thing needs to be in the article (compare e.g. Template:Did you know nominations/Urine deflector, which similarly took some creative licence in how the proposed hooks were phrased beyond what was stated in either the article or the cited source), and I agree with HLHJ that WP:IAR would be applicable regardless. As for the hooks themselves, writing "a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone may be described as 88.5.3.2" is a much poorer way of writing the hook (less "hooky") than the converse, i.e. "88.5.3.2 may refer to a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone". TompaDompa (talk) 11:28, 14 November 2021 (UTC) This. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 17:01, 16 November 2021 (UTC) We can't use IP address because the nominator just thought it up "oh, that looks like an IP address". It's not in the source as the nominator admits and therefore is not verifiable. And so what if it does look like an IP address? What does that tell us about broken toes? I like clever or quirky hooks and have written many (if I may say so), but they have to be based on something in the sources otherwise it's things made up one day. Philafrenzy (talk) 10:19, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you for all your comments. This is not the place to ignore all rules. The proposed hook is not supported by the source given in the article. I am inclined to approve ALT1 but it needs checking, unless another hook is proposed. Whispyhistory (talk) 15:11, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Oh dear, this has become contentious. I think the contended question is whether it's acceptable to have verified information not found in the nominated article, but only in another article, linked in the hook. Not as hooky, but for illustration: ALT3 ... that the dot-decimal notation string "88.5.3.2" is not only an an IPv4 address, but also a fracture in the middle of the bone at the tip of the little toe? "IPv4 and IPv6 address formats". www.ibm.com., Hallux proximal phalanx fracture in adults: an overlooked diagnosis I don't think we're debating whether the IP-address-hook statement is verifiable. The statement that "88.5.3.2" (and any number in that format) is a valid IPv4 address is supported by the IP address article and the IPv4 article, and this format is the subject of the Dot-decimal notation article. No-one had bothered to cite those statements in those articles, but since they've been challenged here, I've now cited them. So "88.5.3.2 is both an IP address[1] and a code for a broken toebone[2]" is certainly verifiable, and is now verified on Wikipedia.

HLHJ (talk) 20:22, 14 November 2021 (UTC) [edited to replace the wrong url, copy-paste mistake] Please don't strike the proposed hook as you have done. You certainly don't have consensus to do that. As several people have explained above, the hook is supported by the article and the source. Dr. Vogel (talk) 15:31, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I don't think the reviewer needs consensus Dr Vogel. I agree and have re-struck it. Please work on something else. I am sure you can develop something good, or tweak the Alt1. Philafrenzy (talk) 19:24, 14 November 2021 (UTC) How about ALT2 ....that 88.5.3.2 is one way of describing a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone? Philafrenzy (talk) 19:25, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you Philafrenzy ( a very experienced DYK contributor) for your efforts in helping new editors understand DYK. Your comment higher up about "88.5.3.2" and "ip address" not being in the source is true and I am grateful for your suggested alts. Essentially, the initial and subsequent hooks sound good, but none are in the article or the source. I don't wish for personal comments and don't mind if someone else wishes to take over here. With due respect @DrVogel: and @HLHJ:...You may wish to take this up at Wikipedia talk:Did you know. Whispyhistory (talk) 10:41, 15 November 2021 (UTC) I won't say I wish I hadn't written the article; I hope it's useful enough to make up for the social harm to the project here. I don't think the hostility was intended by anyone; I suspect that it's felt partly due to the ease of mininterpretation in a text-only medium and partly due to human cognitive biases.[2] I certainly did, and do, not intend it. I spent a day's editing trying to resolve the conflict by finding references specifically saying that the two things were in notation X and adding that text to the article, but unfortunately non-inductive descriptions of the notations seem to have been considered so needless that an Internet RFC attempting to formalize them died of disinterest. I did find a source that explicitly defines the IPv4 format, and one that explicitly says that 88.1.2.2 is a specific fracture, and I've cited the latter in the article, but I don't think this helps. It is probably a bit unreasonable to expect a reviewer to do more than apply rules as best they can, and Wikipedia talk:Did you know might indeed be a better forum for a more detailed discussion. I don't really want to take part in one, though (nothing to do with this discussion, prior reasons). I posted because I felt responsible for the conflict and thought I might be able to help. My impression is that I made it worse; my apologies to everyone I've offended. HLHJ (talk) 03:41, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Nobody is offended, but if I may say so I think you are still missing the point. IP addresses have nothing to do with broken toes even if that notation may have a similarity. That's why the sources don't make the comparison and why the IP-based hooks are no good. Any of the other hooks might be fine (I haven't checked the numbers) just without the bit about IP addresses. The whole thing reminds me of unusually shaped vegetables where you may see a carrot shaped like a foot, people who see faces in clouds, and even apophenia. My personal observation that one thing looks a bit like another is not the basis for a hook unless reliable sources make the point too. Philafrenzy (talk) 09:09, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Folks, we are wasting a wonderful hook. Really. IP addresses have nothing to do with broken toes even if that notation may have a similarity and that is the whole point of making good hooks. They are supposed to be short, punchy, catchy, and likely to draw the readers in to wanting to read the article – as long as they don't misstate the article content. And one of the best recipes to make a hook good is to make it sound counterintuitive With any other option but the original, we are bound to receive another hook frequented by maybe a few hundred visitors. I would propose something to the tune of in some contexts, 88.5.3.2 might not mean an IP address but a broken bone in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone? so that no one claims here that we somehow delegitimise the IP address but at the same time so that we preserve the core of the hook. As for the claims that because the hook is not cited in the IP part, it can't be there - please don't be that pedantic. In our today's world of informatics we may assume that people who visit Wikipedia more or less imagine what IP addresses are, and may more or less imagine how they look like (in the worst case they will visit the article for details). The other part is cited. I see no problem with the original. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 17:01, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Szmenderowiecki I admit that I'm not very familiar with the topic, and the above discussion was confusing, but is the "this isn't an IP address" claim actually in the source? Because if it's not, then no matter how good the hook proposal is, it can't be used in a hook since hook facts need to be based on a reference. Also, I'm pretty sure that assumptions don't count as sources. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:31, 17 November 2021 (UTC) What I was leading is that we don't need to cite that the sky is blue, or that we have five fingers; or that there exist IP addresses for that matter. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 11:08, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Given that these IP number hooks aren't working out so far, I wonder if some other hooks unrelated to that could be proposed here. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 02:11, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Comment only If we accept the first hook we will end up with thousands of hits, some quiet smiles and some who will continue to believe that DYK broke the rules. We're allowed to. This is not a massive occasion where we can save the whole project by breaking the rules. Its a trivial example of what some (not all) think may be a breach in the rules, with a small, but amusing, advantage. So I'm not asking the defenders of the rules to admit that this is not a breech ... I am suggesting that they might just concede that the harm done by allowing this hook might not offend anyone ... and it might please a few thousand.

Nominated by Victuallers (talk) at 16:21, 6 November 2021 (UTC). Article is new enough. Two correct writers are credited. The article is fully referenced. No copyvio detected. There is a bit of biased POV pushing in Wikipedia voice: "most vulnerable to climate change". This will be something our subject is saying no doubt. And this idea is also reflected in the hook with "endangered". The hook content is referenced and confirmed by the Guardian, apart from the "endangered" bit, which opinion is attributed to Tina Stege. So I suggest that "endangered" is taken out of the hook, or it is reworded so it is clear she is saying that. Hook alt1 is unsuitable as it does not link the article and I cannot tell what it is trying to say in relation to the subject. I can confirm image is CC-BY-3.0 as derived from the video with CC-BY-3.0 license. However I would suggest that a different image is selected from the video, perhaps near the end where the microphone is not obscuring her chin. QPQ is done.

Self-nominated at 23:51, 4 November 2021 (UTC). @DferDaisy: This article is about 3300 bytes, and was nominated for DYK shortly after creation, satisfying date and length criteria. There is a factual error, as the article states she was interred in Keokuk, Illinois, but the source says she died in Chicago, Illinois and was interred in Keokuk, Iowa. I am assuming good faith for a few references I cannot access (for example, ref 15 - The National Humane Review), which for me gives a landing page for the document, instead of an inside view). Otherwise, everything is properly sourced and there are no copyvio or close paraphrasing concerns (Earwig cites 3 potential problems, but they are not an issue here.) QPQ not required. Regarding the hooks, ALT0 is incorrect as stated, as it reads as if the study was conducted in the early 1900s by Meigs Crowder, whereas she published it in 1917 based on studies from that period. It'll need minor alteration. ALT1 is fine and sourced. I would prefer to promote an amended ALT0. A minor quibble, though not an issue for DYK: please add page numbers for cited sources.

AleatoryPonderings (???) (!!!) 01:52, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @AleatoryPonderings: Yes, but note that this court case is the "leading case with respect to the issue of common employers", establishing a precedent in Canadian law. At the time the lawsuit was filed, this was not the case, and in fact the trial judge ruled against Alouche (see last paragraph of background section); it was only after the case was brought to the Court of Appeal for Ontario that the "common employer doctrine" was established, and it became entrenched when leave to appeal the decision at the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed. Mindmatrix 15:11, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Ah, so the idea behind the hook is that, since Downtown Eatery changed the law on common employers, before Downtown Eatery Best Beaver would not have been Alouche's employer? That makes more sense. AleatoryPonderings (???) (!!!) 15:20, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: I'm going to inspect this again... Mindmatrix 15:18, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @AleatoryPonderings: Alright, so to ensure everything is correct, the following timeline occurred: Alouche was hired to be manager at For Your Eyes Only (owned by Grad and Grosman), and began work on 29 December 1992 Alouche was sent a Notice of Discipline in May 1993, and was fired on 15 June 1993 In October 1993, Alouche filed action for wrongful dismissal against Best Beaver Management Inc., as that was the source of his paycheques Best Beaver ceased operations in mid-1996, and all assets distributed to other companies owned by Grad and Grosman The trial resolved in favour of Alouche Best Beaver did not pay out the judgement (all its assets had been redistributed) Sherriffs were dispatched to For Your Eyes Only, where they seized $1,855 Downtown Eatery filed claim against Alouche, stating the cash belonged to it Alouche defended, and counterclaimed against Grad, Grosman, and all companies they controlled on the grounds of common employer doctrine, the oppression remedy of the Ontario Business Corporations Act, and fraudulent conveyance the judge in the second trial (at Ontario Superior Court of Justice) ruled against Alouche the case was brought to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, where the previous ruling was overturned in 2001 in January 2002, an application for leave to appeal the decision at the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed So, the common employer doctrine was part of the second trial as a counterclaim to the suit filed by Downtown Eatery. I just wanted to ensure this satisfies your concerns. Mindmatrix 18:25, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks for this incredibly thorough response. My concern is maybe philosophical or definitional. If I say that company A employs person B, that has an ordinary meaning and a legal meaning. It is probably right that Best Beaver did not employ Alouche in the ordinary sense of "employ", because Best Beaver was a "paymaster" and not the name on the front of the building where he went to work. My reading of the case itself is that, before Downtown Eatery, it was at best indeterminate as a legal matter whether Best Beaver, alone or in combination with its affiliate companies, employed Alouche. After Downtown Eatery, it was established—as a matter of legal meaning, but not necessarily ordinary meaning—that Best Beaver was his employer, or part of his employer, or something like that. The reason I brought this up is that it's not clear how one could verify the claim that "Best Beaver was not Alouche's employer", because that claim might be true as a matter of ordinary meaning but the only authoritative legal ruling we have on this (namely, Downtown Eatery) holds that the claim is false. In any event, I'll leave this to the eventual reviewer to sort out. I find my brain twisting into knots. AleatoryPonderings (???)

Additionally, per MOS:FILMCAST uncredited roles need a source. the copyvio checker showed up a 50%+ similarity with a source, which may suggest over quotation.

Freely licensed: Y Used in article: Y Clear at 100px: Y QPQ: Done. Overall: This is a nice article, which is new enough, long enough and well sourced. I am taking the offline sources in good faith. However, I have an issue with the hook which is not directly supported by the source. The source says that the two tribes hunt the bird for bushmeat and decorate their headgear and houses with its feathers and beaks. In another place it just says that "the gizzard of the hornbill was used in some local medicines for curing stomach disorders," but nowhere is this stated as a belief of those two tribes. So it needs to be amended to reflect the source. Alternatively there are some "fascinating facts" at the Oakland Zoo source that could be used, noting that they use a different English name, but the same Latin one. That name, Malayan wreathed hornbill, should perhaps be included in the lede. Also I wonder if the existing alternative name should just be bar-pouched hornbill as per the same website? Bermicourt (talk) 13:57, 11 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks for your feedback, Bermicourt! Re the gizzard : true is that it is not stated in any source that the local people believe .., but only that they use it for curing stomach problems. So I wonder whether the hook should / can be changed to either a) that they use it as medicine, or b) to a different hook altogether, e.g. something about the bird itself : that it flies up to some 25 km from its breeding site in search of favoured fruits, much farther than any other hornbill species. I didn't add this info yet, but can do if you think it worthwhile? Re the name "Malayan wreathed hornbill" : Blanford (1889) seems to have been the first and only one who used this name, but I haven't seen this in any other publication yet. – BhagyaMani (talk) 21:44, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks also to @Casliber: for DYK nominating this page!! – BhagyaMani (talk) 21:44, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, I think this article is worthy of a DYK, but you need to come up with one or two alternative hooks.

Maximilian Dood ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that in August 2021, YouTuber Maximilian Dood's viral social media campaign for Marvel vs. Capcom 2's rerelease caught the regards of studio Digital Eclipse, who expressed interest in rereleasing the game? Source: 1 and 2 Comment: This is the first time I’ve ever made a DYK here, so here goes. I personally find this fact interesting because it highlights how the advent of YouTube, and internet fame in general, has allowed people to use their voice to reach people in positions of high influence, bringing hidden ideas to light and advocating for change. While this specific example falls under a video game/pop-culture category, and may not fit Wikipedia’s desire for academic material, I feel that this is interesting enough to share, as it’s one the gaming community can relate to, like with other social media trends such as #FreeSmash and "Rerelease Mother 3." As for the article itself, all of the citations should be reliable enough; they’re all from third-party/secondary source outlets and there isn’t any BLP violation to be found here. One concern I have is criteria #3 - “Each fact in the hook must be supported in the article by at least one inline citation to a reliable source, appearing no later than the end of the sentence(s) offering that fact. Citations at the end of the paragraph are not sufficient.” While the hook is sourced in the article, the refs are at the end of the section rather than per each sentence. I can fix that however. Anyway, I hope this fact does get accepted! If not, I understand, thanks for reviewing this anyway. Created/expanded by PantheonRadiance (talk). Self-nominated at 08:45, 17 November 2021 (UTC).

You'd need to have expanded the text content by 5x in length, which I am not seeing in the page history. You'll also need to resolve the many tags for additional citations and expansion in the article. Your best bet would be to get it to good article status and renominate then.

Kaleeb18 (talk) 16:28, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Hi Kaleeb18, no worries and good luck with the article. The expansion is based on the number of characters (ie. letters, spaces etc.) in the article before you started work on it and the number after you've finished.

Article is new enough, very newsworthy event and hence well-sourced, no copyvios (Earwig reports a false positive on the Johnson quotation), QPQ done.

The hook is in-line sourced. Photo has appropriate license. QPQ is done. There are, however, two problems: (1) There is some significant overlap with this source. To start, the following sentence is taken from the source without use of quotation marks and with no effort to paraphrase rather than use the precise words: "Local advocacy led to the establishment of Bridle Trails as a state park in 1932." Further, this sentence also strikes me as too closely drawn from the same source: "Initial park development dates to 1933 when Civil Works Administration employees and federal relief workers were employed in state parks as part of the New Deal program. Further work included burning logging debris, clearing brush and building trails and fences." Work needs to be done to put the material into your own words. (2) The hook strikes me as boring in that it states an obvious point. Horses having the right of way on this trail is not unique or special. On trails that are shared by humans and horses, it is the general rule that horses have the right of way. See here ("In general, horses always have the right of way, followed by hikers, then by bikers."). See also here ("For safety reasons, if you come across a horse and rider on any trail they always have right of way. Hikers and bike riders all yield to horses.")

Self-nominated at 05:17, 15 November 2021 (UTC). I agree that the thing about the misquotation is the hookiest fact in the article, but it's clumsily phrased here. For one, the quote is not actually "could have been made by aliens" so, considering this is all about misquotation, we should either use the actual quote or clarify that it is a misquotation. Then "as though it was a real announcement" implies that it was actually, I don't know, a fake announcement? A parody? Also, essay collections don't speak: the chapter in question was written by William Edmonson. –?Joe (talk) 09:05, 15 November 2021 (UTC) It's a lot of context to try squeeze into 200 characters, so, and I can't believe I'm suggesting this, why not go with a simple April Fools-style hook: ALT2 ... that according to a NASA essay collection, ancient carvings "might have been made by aliens"?

Reviewed: Thomas Guggeis Comment: This article was created over about 5 months in userspace, then copied and pasted to mainspace on 16 November. As far as I am aware, Queen Victoria never wore the Koh-i-Noor set in a necklace, though she did wear it set in a brooch and in a circlet (headdress). So the necklace with the Koh-i-Noor in this sculpture is probably artistic licence. Created by Storye book (talk). Self-nominated at 16:10, 17 November 2021 (UTC). Captivating storey of a life and career, meticulously referenced on plenty of fine sources, offline sources accepted AGF, no copyvio obvious. The image is licensed. The hook works, but I don't see the diamond in the image. I am willing to approve it but would like to discuss other options: mention the artistic license, because I didn't know the detail of her not wearing that gem in a necklace don't mention the diamond detail, focus on the jubilee, and use the second image from the gallery which show the greatness of the design better than the head detail base a hook on the Warrior/Youth work which I find much more attractive as an artwork, and as an image in small size ;) Let me know.

Graham87 09:41, 18 November 2021 (UTC) @Gerda Arendt: Thank you for the review. Diamonds were often cut in cabochon style in the 19th century and earlier. This one was cut with a flat bottom like all cabochons, and when viewed from above, it was a large oval, about 1.5 inches long. Modern cabochons usually have a smoothly rounded surface; this one was lightly faceted but the facets don't show on the sculpture. So it looks like half an egg, I suppose. The Koh-i-Noor is the large oval at the bottom of the picture. We have no specific citation for artistic licence - that is just a conclusion that we can probably make, since we have no evidence that Victoria ever had it set in a necklace. Therefore I cannot use "artistic licence" in a hook or in the article. I'll have a go at a hook using a full-length Victoria, and another hook using the Warrior and Wounded Youth sculpture. I'll come back shortly with those.

I've been trying to come up with something catchy on this -- for example, had Comeau invited Trump to participate in a performance of the work, then we could say he told Trump to fugue himself -- but the sourcing just isn't there that I can see.

I therefore want to use this platform to suggest ways we can contribute to meaningful anti-Trump resistance.".

Further information: Official supplementary guidelines and unofficial guide  Warning: You are not logged in. Please create an account or log in to proceed. Alternatively, you may leave a message at the bottom of the DYK project talk page with the article you would like to nominate and the hook you would like to propose.  Warning: The helper script only works on desktop. Please switch to desktop view to continue. Install the DYK helper script by adding the line {{subst:lusc|User:SD0001/DYK-helper.js}} to your common.js page. Go back to the article, and choose the "DYK" option from the "More" menu (see image). Fill in the form and submit it. Check back periodically to address comments or concerns from the reviewer (it may take several weeks). Manual instructions[edit] Create a subpage for your new DYK suggestion and then list the page below under the date the article was created or the expansion began or it became a good article (not the date you submit it here), with the newest dates at the bottom. Any registered user may nominate a DYK suggestion (if you are not a registered user, please leave a message at the bottom of the DYK project talk page with the details of the article you would like to nominate and the hook you would like to propose); self-nominations are permitted and encouraged. Thanks for participating and please remember to check back for comments on your nomination (consider watchlisting your nomination page). Read these instructions completely before proceeding. For simplified instructions, see User:Rjanag/Quick DYK 2. I. Create the nomination subpage. Enter the article title in the box below and click the button. (To nominate multiple articles together, enter any or all of the article titles.) You will then be taken to a preloaded nomination page. II. Write the nomination. On the nomination page, fill in the relevant information. See Template:NewDYKnomination and {{NewDYKnomination/guide}} for further information. Not every line of the template needs to be filled in. For instance, if you are not nominating an image to appear with your hook, there is no need to fill in the image-related lines. Add an edit summary e.g. "Nominating YOUR ARTICLE TITLE for DYK" and click Publish page. Make sure the nomination page is on your watchlist, so you can follow the review discussion. III. Post at Template talk:Did you know. In the current nominations section find the subsection for the date on which the article was created or on which expansion began (or, if a new Good Article, the date on which it became a GA), not the date on which you make the nomination. At the top of that subsection (before other nominations already there, but below the section head and hidden comment) add {{Did you know nominations/YOUR ARTICLE TITLE}}. Add an edit summary e.g. "Nominating YOUR ARTICLE TITLE for DYK" and click Publish page. Frequently asked questions[edit] How do I write an interesting hook? Successful hooks tend to have several traits. Most importantly, they share a surprising or intriguing fact. They give readers enough context to understand the hook, but leave enough out to make them want to learn more. They are written for a general audience who has no prior knowledge of or interest in the topic area. Lastly, they are concise, and do not attempt to cover multiple facts or present information about the subject beyond what's needed to understand the hook. When will my nomination be reviewed? This page is often backlogged. As long as your submission is still on the page, it will stay there until an editor reviews it. Since editors are encouraged to review the oldest submissions first, it may take several weeks until your submission is reviewed. In the meantime, please consider reviewing another submission (not your own) to help reduce the backlog (see instructions below). Where is my hook? If you can't find the nomination you submitted to this nominations page, it may have been approved and is on the approved nominations page waiting to be promoted. It could also have been added to one of the prep areas, promoted from prep to a queue, or is on the main page. If the nominated hook is in none of those places, then the nomination has probably been rejected. Such a rejection usually only occurs if it was at least a couple of weeks old and had unresolved issues for which any discussion had gone stale. If you think your nomination was unfairly rejected, you can query this on the DYK discussion page, but as a general rule such nominations will only be restored in exceptional circumstances. Instructions for reviewers[edit] Main page: Wikipedia:Did you know/Reviewing guide Any editor who was not involved in writing/expanding or nominating an article may review it by checking to see that the article meets all the DYK criteria (long enough, new enough, no serious editorial or content issues) and the hook is cited. Editors may also alter the suggested hook to improve it, suggest new hooks, or even lend a hand and make edits to the article to which the hook applies so that the hook is supported and accurate. For a more detailed discussion of the DYK rules and review process see the supplementary guidelines and the WP:Did you know/Reviewing guide. To post a comment or review on a DYK nomination, follow the steps outlined below: Look through this page, Template talk:Did you know, to find a nomination you would like to comment on. Click the "Review or comment" link at the top of the nomination. You will be taken to the nomination subpage. The top of the page includes a list of the DYK criteria. Check the article to ensure it meets all the relevant criteria. To indicate the result of the review (i.e., whether the nomination passes, fails, or needs some minor changes), leave a signed comment on the page. Please begin with one of the 5 review symbols that appear at the top of the edit screen, and then indicate all aspects of the article that you have reviewed; your comment should look something like the following: Article length and age are fine, no copyvio or plagiarism concerns, reliable sources are used. But the hook needs to be shortened. If you are the first person to comment on the nomination, there will be a line :* <!-- REPLACE THIS LINE TO WRITE FIRST COMMENT, KEEPING  :* --> showing you where you should put the comment. Save the page. If there is any problem or concern about a nomination, please consider notifying the nominator by placing {{subst:DYKproblem|Article|header=yes|sig=yes}} on the nominator's talk page. Instructions for project members[edit] How to promote an accepted hook[edit] At-a-glance instructions on how to promote an approved hook to a Prep area See Wikipedia:Did you know/Preparation areas for details on verifying a hook's acceptability. Promoters should not promote their own nomination or their own review When promoting hooks intended for a particular date, keep in mind that when the number of available approved nominations exceeds 120 we switch to two sets per day, and when that number drops below 60 we return to one set per day. Check list for nomination review completeness 1) Select a hook from the approved nominations page that has one of these ticks at the bottom post: . 2) Check to make sure basic review requirements were completed. a. Any outstanding issue following needs to be addressed before promoting. 3) Check the article history for any substantive changes since it was nominated or reviewed. 4) Images for the lead slot must be freely licensed. Fair-use images are not permitted. Images loaded on Commons that appear on the Main Page are automatically protected by KrinkleBot. 5) Hook must be stated in both the article and source (which must be cited at the end of the article sentence where stated). 6) Hook should make sense grammatically. 7) Try to vary subject matters within each prep area. 8) Try to select a funny, quirky or otherwise upbeat hook for the last or bottom hook in the set. Steps to add a hook to prep In one tab, open the nomination page of the hook you want to promote. In a second tab, open the prep set you intend to add the hook to. 1) For hooks held for specific dates, refer to "Local update times" section on DYK Queue. a. Completed Prep area number sets will be promoted by an administrator to corresponding Queue number. 2) Copy and paste the hook into a chosen slot. a. Make sure there's a space between ... and that, and a ? at the end. b. Check that there's a bold link to the article. 3) If it's the lead (first) hook, paste the image where indicated at the top of the template. 4) Copy and paste ALL the credit information (the {{DYKmake}} and {{DYKnom}} templates) at the bottom 5) Check your work in the prep's Preview mode. a. At the bottom under "Credits", to the right of each article should have the link "View nom subpage" ; if not, a subpage parameter will need to be added to the DYKmake. 6) Save the Prep page. Closing the DYK nomination page At the upper left Change {{DYKsubpage to {{subst:DYKsubpage Change |passed= to |passed=yes At the bottom Just above the line containing }}<!--Please do not write below this line or remove this line. Place comments above this line.--> insert a new, separate line containing one of the following: To [[T:DYK/P1|Prep 1]] To [[T:DYK/P2|Prep 2]] To [[T:DYK/P3|Prep 3]] To [[T:DYK/P4|Prep 4]] To [[T:DYK/P5|Prep 5]] To [[T:DYK/P6|Prep 6]] To [[T:DYK/P7|Prep 7]] Also paste the same thing into the edit summary. Check in Preview mode. Make sure everything is against a pale blue background (nothing outside) and there are no stray characters, like }}, at the top or bottom. Save. For more information, please see T:TDYK#How to promote an accepted hook. Handy copy sources: To [[T:DYK/P1|Prep 1]] To [[T:DYK/P2|Prep 2]] To [[T:DYK/P3|Prep 3]] To [[T:DYK/P4|Prep 4]] To [[T:DYK/P5|Prep 5]] To [[T:DYK/P6|Prep 6]] To [[T:DYK/P7|Prep 7]] How to remove a rejected hook[edit] Open the DYK nomination subpage of the hook you would like to remove. (It's best to wait several days after a reviewer has rejected the hook, just in case someone contests or the article undergoes a large change.) In the window where the DYK nomination subpage is open, replace the line {{DYKsubpage with {{subst:DYKsubpage, and replace |passed= with |passed=no. Then save the page. This has the effect of wrapping up the discussion on the DYK nomination subpage in a blue archive box and stating that the nomination was unsuccessful, as well as adding the nomination to a category for archival purposes. How to remove a hook from the prep areas or queue[edit] Edit the prep area or queue where the hook is and remove the hook and the credits associated with it. Go to the hook's nomination subpage (there should have been a link to it in the credits section). View the edit history for that page Go back to the last version before the edit where the hook was promoted, and revert to that version to make the nomination active again. Add a new icon on the nomination subpage to cancel the previous tick and leave a comment after it explaining that the hook was removed from the prep area or queue, and why, so that later reviewers are aware of this issue. Add a transclusion of the template back to this page so that reviewers can see it. It goes under the date that it was first created/expanded/listed as a GA. You may need to add back the day header for that date if it had been removed from this page. If you removed the hook from a queue, it is best to either replace it with another hook from one of the prep areas, or to leave a message at WT:DYK asking someone else to do so. How to move a nomination subpage to a new name[edit] Don't; it should not ever be necessary, and will break some links which will later need to be repaired. Even if you change the title of the article, you don't need to move the nomination page. Nominations[edit] Older nominations[edit] Articles created/expanded on September 2[edit] Inger K.

(Proposed as a possible alternative by Cavalryman) ALT3:... that Inger K. Frith, the first woman president of a major international sporting federation, played a key role in returning archery to the Olympics? (proposed by PMCH2 Created by SportsOlympic (talk). Self-nominated at 14:12, 2 September 2021 (UTC). SportsOlympic has been blocked for sockpuppetry. Created by Cavalryman (talk) General: Article is new enough and long enough New Enough: Y Long Enough: Y Policy compliance: Adequate sourcing: N - Several problems here: Sources: "Olympedia – Inger K. Frith". www.olympedia.org. – this source is of questionable reliability. MRS. INGER FRITH, Olympic Review, 1971 – the link doesn’t work for me and there is inadequate bibliographic information for me to verify what it is. "Danish WW2 Pilots | Inger Kristine Frith (née Pragholm) (1909 - 1981)". www.danishww2pilots.dk. – I am satisfied a website run by Mikkel Plannthin about WWII Danish pilots is generally reliable (he has been published writing about this subject matter) but ... this seems to have been written largely from information gained in this forum thread and there is a big disclaimer at the bottom of this article raising some very significant discrepancies within the entry, which are included as fact in the article. Particularly the rank of Captain which never existed in the WAAF. I feel this raises questions about the reliability of the source. "Inger Frith blazed a trail for women in sports governance". www.insidethegames.biz. March 5, 2021. – looks reliable to me. The third paragraph in the WWII section is uncited. Filling more parameters in Template:Cite web, particularly authorship, would go a long way to presentation. Neutral: Y Free of copyright violations, plagiarism, and close paraphrasing: Y Other problems: N - The article misattributes several statements: likely the highest ranked Danish woman in service during the Second World War – the cited source states that she was the highest ranked that the author is aware of. She became a volunteer in the army in Cape Town and was later accepted for the Air Force – the cited source makes no mention of the Army. Hook eligibility: Cited: N - cites two sources with issues as described above Interesting: Y Other problems: N - perhaps base the hook on excellent insidethegames.biz article, something like “ that after serving in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War, Inger K. Frith became the first woman to lead a major international sporting federation and returned archery to the Olympics?” I have added it as a possible alternate above but am happy to play with it. QPQ: N - Not done Overall: I apologise if I seem to have been very harsh and I could be being very finicky, but the article is very clunky to read, with short little sentences and paragraphs that I feel don’t flow very well. Further, there is no such thing as the “British Air Force”, it is the United Kingdom’s air force or the Royal Air Force. Earwig shows 13.8% match to the Plannthin webpage, but I don’t think it breaches the COPYVIO threshold. Also QPQ is required. Cavalryman (talk) 04:08, 3 September 2021 (UTC). Hello @SportsOlympic: this nomination has been sitting here for almost a week and I can see you have not edited the article, nor have you supplied a QPQ. Are you still interested in pursuing the nomination? Cavalryman (talk) 12:56, 9 September 2021 (UTC). Olympedia are the same people as Sports Reference and is states at WP:Sports as reliable. It’s a pitty you can’t open the second source, is has great and reliable content. So the main issue is that it stated that she was Captain and the naming of the British Air Force? I’m not native English, so I can’t write it in high class English. As that is a problem, I can’t improve it to your satisfactions. I will rename the Air Force name and title of Captain because that might me wrong. Next to that, I don’t like your other option: it not mentioned she had a high rank and she was the first female at an sports federation SportsOlympic (talk) 20:24, 9 September 2021 (UTC) I can find no such reference at WP:Sports but perhaps I am missing something, there has only been one discussion at the reliable source noticeboard WP:Reliable sources/Noticeboard/Archive 335#Olympedia, that being said it is not used to cite anything controversial. Whilst you have made a couple of small fixes, you missed some of the nuance in my comments above particularly those points listed in green. Further, the claim in the hook to be high ranked depends upon if the rank of Captain (which is clearly wrong) is supposed to be an Army or a Navy Captain, a Captain in the Army is not high ranked, Navy is getting up there. As it stands I feel this article is not at the standard required to be featured on the main page, but I am happy for others to take a look at it. Cavalryman (talk) 22:38, 9 September 2021 (UTC). I have not looked at the article but would like to confirm that Olympedia is an authoritative source for Olympic bios. Schwede66 18:15, 13 September 2021 (UTC) Schwede66, many thanks, honestly Olympedia is the least of the issues here. Kind regards, Cavalryman (talk) 22:39, 13 September 2021 (UTC). It has been over a week and the nominator has made very little effort to rectify many of the issues raised above, nor have they supplied a QPQ (I was considering donating a QPQ if issues were rectified). They have received a TP notification [1] and been pinged above, so unfortunately I think this should be marked as ineligible and closed. Cavalryman (talk) 00:44, 17 September 2021 (UTC). Hi Cavalryman, I've done considerable cleanup work on the article, finding published sources for a good bit of the material, and rewriting some parts based on the additions. This one should get a whole new review. Mary Mark Ockerbloom (talk) 06:40, 17 September 2021 (UTC) It might need a new hook too: ALT4:... that after serving as a meteorological officer in the Second World War, Inger K.

DONE Capt. Inger Kristine Frith (nee Pragholm) is recorded as being born on 23 January 1909, and having served (W/265733) in the South African Air Force (SAAF) from 23 October 1941 to 21 July 1945 as a meteorologist/forecaster. Extremely awkward, and leading with Captain gives the impression that she was subsequently demoted to Second Lieutenant in the following paragraph. - reworded She and her husband eventually settled in Crowthorne. Sticks out like a sore thumb, maybe move it into the later life section, as in "died in Crowthorne where she and Ronald had established their home."REMOVED In 1985, she was credited as "the main architect of archery's reintroduction to the Olympic programme in 1972." This quote needs in-text attribution. DONE It's getting closer, with some of the issues raised in the first review have still not been resolved, and care needs to taken to ensure the correct source is used to cite certain pieces of information. I have struck ALT0 because we have now clarified that she was not "a high ranked pilot during World War II". Cavalryman (talk) 04:03, 20 September 2021 (UTC). I have also struck my first ALT1 as she did not serve in the RAF but instead served in the SAAF, so have added ALT2, with no preference between it and ALT4. Cavalryman (talk) 00:48, 21 September 2021 (UTC). ALT numbers amended to reflect added ALT3 above. Cavalryman (talk) 21:46, 5 October 2021 (UTC). Unfortunately, Cavalryman, there were two hooks labeled ALT3. I renamed the second one "ALT4", but you should specify whether you were referring to the first ALT3 or the one now called ALT4. MANdARAX • XA?Ab?AM 21:08, 5 October 2021 (UTC) @Mandarax: yes I can see the second ALT3 was added here, I have amended my comment accordingly. Kind regards, Cavalryman (talk) 21:46, 5 October 2021 (UTC). I have copy-edited the article. She served in both the Women's RAF and the SAAF, but I am not sure that the article needs to be held up over debates about her wartime service. I have proposed an alternative that just focuses on her role in sports. The article is worth including in DYK, so I am happy to step in a help get it finished. The sources seem credible to me. Are there other issues left? PMCH2 (talk) 22:46, 26 September 2021 (UTC) Respectfully, not all of the issues raised in the above review have been addressed. Further, then sent to Cairo where she transferred from the SAAF to Great Britain's Women's Royal Air Force, receiving a commission contradicts the preceding paragraph that says she served ... in the South African Air Force (SAAF) from 23 October 1941 to 21 July 1945 and the fact that to have been a Second Lieutenant she must already have been a commissioned officer. Cavalryman (talk) 12:49, 27 September 2021 (UTC). I have added archive links for sources that don't have authors. I removed the one link that didn't work. Others have appropriate details. I have replied above to the concerns I have addressed. I removed the phrase about the commission. I have done my best to address all the issues. PMCH2 (talk) 03:26, 3 October 2021 (UTC) @PMCH2: when I get a chance I will have another detailed look. At a cursory glance, there is still plenty of room to add more bibliographic information to the citations, for instance the www.danishww2pilots.dk source should be: Plannthin, Mikkel (12 September 2010). "Inger Kristine Frith (née Pragholm)". Danish WW2 Pilots. Archived from the original on 31 August 2021. Retrieved 29 August 2021. I will look at the rest soon. Also, a QPQ still has not been provided. Cavalryman (talk) 21:59, 5 October 2021 (UTC). I haven't seen a DYK be scrutinized this closely before in regards to citations. I stepped in to try to help, but it's not my article, and I have spent as much time as I can. You seem to have a very high bar. I don't have a DYK credit to donate. 22:57, 7 October 2021 (UTC) I am sorry you think I am being overly harsh, but I think it is plain sloppy not including proper attribution, and the with the example above I think the fact that the same author is responsible for two cited sources is relevant. I initially reviewed the article because I thought the subject was interesting and worthy of some time in the main page sun. But I too have found it frustrating, I have conducted two complete reviews and even then my findings have not been acted upon, and further still there has been a stunningly consistent lack of attention to detail. I will now do some editing of the article to bring it up to a standard I believe is required. Cavalryman (talk) 01:28, 8 October 2021 (UTC). Thanks for your edits on the article. It reads better and I can see you have cleaned up the sources. I will do a QPQ this weekend, so we can get this over the line.PMCH2 (talk) 12:41, 10 October 2021 (UTC) Many thanks. If you cannot I will try to do one. I also intend to email World Archery to see if we can get a photo. Regards, Cavalryman (talk) 13:13, 10 October 2021 (UTC). I have reviewed Kennin Rebellion for DYK. Thanks for chasing down a photo - that would be great.PMCH2 (talk) 14:03, 12 October 2021 (UTC) Many thanks. Re photo I have been had correspondence with World Archery and they have said we can use the 1961 photo in this article, I am just trying to get them to confirm what license they are happy to release it under. Given I am now responsible for over 70% of the text [2], should a fresh reviewer have a look at this? Cavalryman (talk) 22:10, 12 October 2021 (UTC). After some initial positive correspondence World Archery not responded about licenses for almost a week. I will send one more email but am not holding my breath that a photo will be released. Cavalryman (talk) 22:29, 17 October 2021 (UTC). yeah, I think we're going to need a new reviewer on this one. Cavalryman, given your contributions to getting this article to DYK, I've added you to the credits section. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 20:04, 18 October 2021 (UTC) As best I can tell, the major issues concerning sourcing and attribution have been addressed, and this article seems ready for the main page. Thanks to everyone who contributed to make this work. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 04:54, 20 October 2021 (UTC) @Theleekycauldron: if a photo is released I will ping you to see if you are happy for it to be added to the nomination. Kind regards, Cavalryman (talk) 05:09, 20 October 2021 (UTC). Re photo ... the person I have been corresponding with at World Archery needs to return to the office to confirm their ownership status of this picture, due to covid that cannot occur before 4th November. I request this be held off until then. Cavalryman (talk) 09:50, 20 October 2021 (UTC). @Cavalryman: happy to wait. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 20:23, 21 October 2021 (UTC) Any updates on the image? If we waiting just for the image, I'll suggest to let this nomination run without an image. – Kavyansh.Singh (talk) 08:03, 30 October 2021 (UTC) As said above I do not expect any word before the 4th of November. If there is a chronic shortage of articles for DYK then by all means run this, but it would be a shame to potentially deny this most capable woman a face when she is featured for the sake of a week. Cavalryman (talk) 10:08, 31 October 2021 (UTC). There is no shortage of hooks on DYK. I was just concerned about how backlogged this particular nomination is. If it is worth waiting for the image, no issues then. – Kavyansh.Singh (talk) 10:19, 31 October 2021 (UTC) I have just received this in an email from World Archery: I checked last Thursday in our old history books, but there is no mention of photographer there. However, I'm on another track that was given to me by the author of another book on the history of our federation, but I'll have to check it out this Thursday when I'm again in the office. Things are in progress, and I should be able to give you some good news by next week! If everyone is happy to wait a few more days hopefully we’ll have a photo. Cavalryman (talk) 08:07, 8 November 2021 (UTC). @Cavalryman: Any updates? I think this should get promoted within a week if an image doesn't materialize. Side note to @BlueMoonset: original nom has been blocked for socking, do they still get a credit? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 05:13, 17 November 2021 (UTC) theleekycauldron, I'm trying to remember. Why don't you ask at WT:DYK and see whether there are any recollections about past cases, or strong opinions either way. Sorry I can't be more definitive. On the matter of promoting, the nomination will be three months old on December 2, and should have been promoted prior to then. BlueMoonset (talk) 05:30, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I see Wikipedia talk:Did you know/Archive 152#Multiple DYK nominations in process by newly checkuser-blocked sockpuppet: how to proceed?, which ended up with every nom made by the sock being rejected. Since this one's been adopted, We shouldn't close this nom, it's been adopted, but I am striking their credit. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 05:46, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Apologies, I was going to give an update this morning (Australian time). I had an email overnight from World Archery wanting to clarify the process of uploading a picture, I wouldn’t mind betting there will be an email with photo attached in the inbox at permissions@wikimedia.org tomorrow Swiss time. I agree, if there is no image within a week promote it, this has been a lengthy process. Cavalryman (talk) 06:03, 17 November 2021 (UTC).

Cerevisae (talk) 13:35, 17 October 2021 (UTC) @Narutolovehinata5: I have carried out some copyedits, let me know if there are areas that need another run-through. CMD (talk) 07:59, 24 October 2021 (UTC) Apologies for the late reply! Anyway, ALT0 is probably the best hook among the three proposed (ALT1 seems unimpressive to me while ALT2 may need additional context). However, the sentence verifying ALT0 doesn't have a footnote; instead, the references for it are spread across other nearby sentences instead, duplication is needed here for DYK purposes. In addition, it may be a good idea to propose an additional hook about Sarawak being the biggest timber exporter in the 1980s since that fact seems more interesting than the others discussed here. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 06:53, 1 November 2021 (UTC) added ALT 3. Cerevisae (talk) 04:30, 5 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you for the proposal; however, I feel that it may not meet WP:EGG. Would it be possible to rewrite ALT3 to make the link to "Economy of Sarawak" clearer? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 06:52, 5 November 2021 (UTC) talk, ALT 3 changed. Cerevisae (talk) 14:23, 8 November 2021 (UTC) ALT3 reads better, but it may still need to be copyedited for grammar. In addition it lacks a bold link to the DYK article subject. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:29, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Hook copyedited. CMD (talk) 07:03, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you for the edits. Now the article was new enough and long enough at the time of the nomination and no close paraphrasing was found. However, there are still a number of outstanding issues. Firstly, the sentence that mentions the main hook fact is lacking a footnote, with the relevant reference instead coming at the end of the paragraph where the fact is located at; duplication is necessary here per DYK rules. Secondly, the article doesn't say that the timber industry contributed "greatly" to Sarawak's economy: I would suggest deleting the word "greatly" from the hook, with the rest of that part being accepted as it's implied by the rest of the article. Thirdly, a QPQ has yet to be provided; this was the nominator's sixth nomination, so a QPQ should have been provided at the time of the nomination or within a week of then. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 05:49, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Ok, User:Narutolovehinata5, QPQ done. Cerevisae (talk) 08:11, 21 November 2021 (UTC) References ^ Chiou Sia, Tan (2015).

However, in the article the statement “they considered German lands too poor for annexation” is sourced to p.204 of Wells. pp.206-7 referred to above is used to support that they that “it was too costly in economic and military resources” to go into in Germany. I guess either way the hook is sourced but could you clarify the exact sourcing of the hook. Interesting: Y QPQ: None required. Overall: Interesting thorough article, well-written with good quality sourcing. Earwig shows no issues. Just a minor query around the hook sourcing but otherwise will be good to go. DeCausa (talk) 08:23, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @DeCausa: I found the web link that (for me) shows a preview if you're able to see it: https://books.google.com/books?id=mc30CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA206&lpg=PA206 SpartaN (talk) 10:07, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @SpartaN: Thanks for providing the link. It’s prompted a couple of thoughts for me. Firstly, Wells doesn’t seem to be saying the reason for the withdrawal is definitively known (“… the reasons for these decisions must have lain…”) i.e he’s making an assumption, however well founded. The hook is more definite than Wells is. Secondly, Wells’ emphasis is on the strength of the resistance being behind the reason - the poor value of the territory makes it “not worth it” because of the strength of the resistance. That’s not quite the same as just saying the land wasn’t valuable. (I notice the text you used in the article on this reflects that effort/value ratio issue.) To fix both points would you be prepared to consider an ALT1 which after “…Teutoburg” continues something along the lines of “…likely decided to leave Germany because the military effort was out of proportion to the territory’s value?” although there may need to be some trimming to get it into the 200 character limit. DeCausa (talk) 11:12, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @SpartaN and DeCausa: It's been over a month since the last comments here, have there been any updates? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:31, 13 November 2021 (UTC) From my point of view I’m waiting for SpartaN’s reply to my last post here. But I notice they haven’t edited Wikipedia since then, over a month ago. So I’m not quite sure what can be done. DeCausa (talk) 08:17, 13 November 2021 (UTC) I see. Given that there's really only one issue holding the nomination back, would anyone be willing to adopt this in case SpartaN doesn't return? It would be a shame if the nomination failed at this point. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 06:35, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I’m not sure what exactly are the DYK rules on this but, subject to that, options could be (a) I propose an ALT1 hook and someone else signs it off; (b) someone else proposes an ALT1 hook and I sign it off; (c) if anyone disagrees with me on the original hook I’m happy to step away and they sign it off. DeCausa (talk) 11:04, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I've looked at the Wells source and concur that it is saying the withdrawal was more down to the ratio of effort required to potential reward, and have boldly tweaked the copy in the article to reflect this. For what it's worth, I think ALT1 works just fine. firefly ( t · c ) 11:16, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Ok. I’m just going to formalize the ALT1 and let someone else add the tick and sign off: ALT1:... that the Romans won a series of campaigns against the Germanic tribes after the disaster at Teutoburg but likely decided to leave Germany as the effort was out of proportion to the territory’s value? DeCausa (talk) 12:07, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Since the reviewer has proposed a new hook, another editor will be needed to sign this off. I'm not sure though if the section linking in the bold links is allowed, however. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:29, 15 November 2021 (UTC) sorry, I missed that. It’s not even necessary to link to a section of the article so I’ve taken it out of ALT1.

It cites various sources, and Earwig's Copyvio detector shows 29.1% similarity (violation unlikely). But ... It has few neutrality issues including a neutrality tag. The hook seems fine, and maybe cited in the article. Can we have a source here? Rest, a QPQ has been done. Till the neutrality concerns are resolved, this DYK nomination should be on hold. – Kavyansh.Singh (talk) 06:57, 20 October 2021 (UTC) Kavyansh.Singh I rewrote the disputed section based on more reliable sources. Unfortunately, it was reverted immediately by ?Khirurg who appears to think that the New York Times is not a reliable source. Perhaps they would explain here why they object. (t · c) buidhe 03:05, 24 October 2021 (UTC) Yeah you rewrote it alright - by removing a whole bunch of sources. Maybe you can explain why AP is not reliable source? Perhaps you can also explain why you removed the POV tag, even though your edit did not address any of the issues raised in the talkpage? Khirurg (talk) 03:07, 24 October 2021 (UTC) Khirurg : Hi, I don't think the AP source supports the content it's cited for. The AP source reports that Greece has made certain accusations, it doesn't say whether they are correct or not. I'm not sure how Greek accusations against Turkey (regardless of whether they are correct or not) have any bearing about this article, which is about Greece. Cleanup tags should be removed unless there is active discussion ongoing and the person placing it can substantiate that there is a problem with the article. (t · c) buidhe 03:14, 24 October 2021 (UTC) Not only you removed AP news, you also removed the Brussels International Center. Your edits made the article even more POV, by trying to spin away the hostile actions of the Turkish government. And it's not a "cleanup tag", it's POV tag, and there is very much an active discussion going on, first of all right here. If you are avoiding the article talkpage and spin that "no discussion ongoing", that's not going to work. Khirurg (talk) 03:23, 24 October 2021 (UTC) Khirurg Actually I have no opinion on the reliability of BIC at this point, but I hesitate to cite think tanks when there are better sources available (I cited the New York Times, Verfassungsblog and an academic paper, all of which are higher quality than a think tank). I checked several sources and all of them mention that the main change in February-March 2020 was opening the border to migrants, some also mention that Turkey bussed migrants to the border or that at least one incident of coercing migrants was reported. Your wording suggests that all or many migrants since then were coerced to travel to Greece. This is misleading because few if any reliable sources support coercive "push" tactics being a widespread or systematic practice by Turkey at its border with Greece. (t · c) buidhe 04:02, 24 October 2021 (UTC) Not only is BIC itself a perfectly reliable source (much more so than the partisan NGOs you have filled the article with), but it's really not hard to find sources about the Turkish government coercing migrants to the border [3]. This assume of course that one in inclined to look for sources, instead of pretending they don't exist. And here [4] (and then doubled down [5], you seem to have followed me to a Requested Move I recently participated in, in what appears to be clear WP:HOUND behavior. So everyone can see what's going on here. Khirurg (talk) 00:47, 25 October 2021 (UTC) Okay, coming back to the DYK criteria, this seems to meet everything except the neutrality issues. I see that there has been no active discussion on the talk page form at-least 17 days. @Buidhe Any updates on @Khirurg's concerns? I can' formally approve this until the neutrality concerns are resolved. – Kavyansh.Singh (talk) 16:28, 25 October 2021 (UTC) @Kavyansh.Singh, Buidhe, and Khirurg: this nomination should probably be closed if the neutrality concerns are not resolved one way or another. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 01:21, 10 November 2021 (UTC) Great, now you can filibuster DYKs you don't like by raising spurious "concerns" and inserting loaded language. (t · c) buidhe 01:34, 10 November 2021 (UTC) What "loaded language"? I raised my concerns in the talkpage, and you've done nothing but edit-war since then. Khirurg (talk) 01:54, 10 November 2021 (UTC) The most egregiously loaded language I recall was a human rights violation that encapsulates a will to eliminate a person’s presence on the face of the planet, which was added by you. Khirurg (talk) 02:02, 10 November 2021 (UTC) You insist on inserting loaded language like "Weaponization of migration" and "coercive engineered migration" which simply do not reflect the majority reliable sources (and are only tangentially related to the article topic, because they are accusations against Turkey rather than Greece) as explained above. I explained that you have misrepresented sources as seen above, and substituted opinion pieces for news coverage and peer-reviewed academic papers, and all you do is revert. So it's unclear to me how any progress can be made here. (t · c) buidhe 02:07, 10 November 2021 (UTC) Everything I have added is sourced to reliable sources. As far as opinion pieces, you're the one that has added those, such as this opinion piece written by grad students [6]. You haven't made the slightest effort to meet me halfway, instead you just blanket-revert all my additions claiming "my sources are better than yours". No attempt at dispute resolution, just blanket reverts like this [7]. The article is mainly based on activist NGO sources. Yes, there can be no progress under these conditions. Khirurg (talk) 02:45, 10 November 2021 (UTC) You literally replaced a news article from the New York Times and academic paper with an opinion piece from The Hill regarding the March 2020 escalation in order to replace fact-based description with loaded language of "weaponization". I did not cite any opinion pieces in the article, and it's a lie to say that the article is "mainly based on activist NGO sources". (t · c) buidhe 03:37, 10 November 2021 (UTC) (Personal attack removed). I just linked to an opinion piece you put in the article in my previous post. InfoMigrants, Mare Liberum, Aegean Boat Report are all activist NGOs used as references (to name just a few). The only way to resolve this is through some form of third party mediation. Would you be agreeable to something like that, yes or no? Khirurg (talk) 04:01, 10 November 2021 (UTC) That's simply untrue, InfoMigrants is a journalism outfit based on a media partnership, not a NGO let alone an "activist" one, and the EJIL Talk piece is expert analysis, not from their editorial section. As for third party mediation, sure why not? But I can't see the use in repeating points that were ignored the first time. (t · c) buidhe 12:11, 10 November 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: imho, the best way to break a filibuster is the old fashioned way: cloture motion. I'd recommend that you get as many eyes on this as possible, see if a clearer consensus falls out. my confidence in either of you conceding your point is dwindling, so this back-and-forth seems unhelpful, as you both pointed out. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 08:52, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Articles created/expanded on October 9[edit] Pankratius Pfeiffer ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that Salvatorian priest Pankratius Pfeiffer saved hundreds of Jews in Rome during the Second World War? Reviewed: 1936 Northeast Flood Created by Ergo Sum (talk). Self-nominated at 17:52, 9 October 2021 (UTC). New article that was created on 9 October 2021? is 3,212 characters and nominated on the same day. No copyvios detected and duplication detector of [8][9][10][11][12] reveal no close paraphrasing issues (AGF PDF docs which can't go through Dup detector). Article is well-sourced. Hook is 103 characters long (under 200 character max.) and is interesting. Refs 4 and 5 (verifying the hook) are reliable sources. QPQ done. Looks good to go! —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:41, 9 October 2021 (UTC) Too many red flags here. If he really saved hundreds of Jews, you would expect plenty of confirmation of this in scholarly sources and him to be recognized by Yad Vashem. I can't count the number of times that I've seen mainstream newspapers print completely false stories about Jews being rescued during the holocaust, so better sources are definitely needed to confirm these extraordinary claims. Thanks Brigade Piron for letting me know about this. (t · c) buidhe 16:51, 10 October 2021 (UTC) I have to admit I'm just a bit perplexed by the argument. Except in fairly uncommon cases of multiple RS that contradict each other, we don't generally recognize any "hierarchy" of reliable sources. Sources are either RS or they are not. So I'm not sure what kind of sources you have in mind as "better" sources. The ones currently cited in the article are all RS, so that should be the end of it. I might add that if you seek some manner of official imprimatur in the vein of Yad Vashem, the City of Rome named a street after him. Your point about why there isn't more extensive coverage of this historical figure is well taken but can easily be attributed to the fact that all manner of historical figures are lost to history, especially those who are notable really for one major event in their life that did not come to light until years later, as is the case here. Indeed, one of the RS in this article describes Pfeiffer as being "lost to history." I'm adding the new review icon here so that we can get at least one more editor's evaluation of this. Ergo Sum 13:32, 16 October 2021 (UTC) There are very few people who actually saved hundreds of Jews during the Holocaust and plenty of hoaxes that were reported as truth by various news organizations—for example Necdet Kent. In other cases, actual rescue did occur but the numbers are greatly exaggerated and repeated uncritically by news organizations, such as Raoul Wallenberg. If the story is true you would expect to see it covered in many more credible sources. There are plenty of cases where a source is reliable for some info but not others. For example, someone's CV is often reliable for "they worked at X organization" but not "they are a world expert in Z". Extraordinary claims require extraordinary sourcing. (t · c) buidhe 21:27, 16 October 2021 (UTC) I should say that I share Buidhe's concerns. I think saying that "all manner of historical figures are lost to history" rather side-steps the sheer volume of historical scholarship on all aspects of the Holocaust. On a more banal note, I think part of the problem is that the sources cited are, essentially, all journalistic sources published by explicitly Catholic or Salvatorian outlets. The specific sources cited for the "saved" claim are Romereports (I am not familiar with this outlet, but the typo in the video does not inspire confidence) and a self-published Salvatorian newsletter. Neither are scholarly sources and both are, again, explicitly confessional in nature. I think WP:BIASED may on point in a highly sensitive issue touching on the wider disputes about Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust. Do we know what the Samerski book says, for example? —Brigade Piron (talk) 08:55, 17 October 2021 (UTC) Buidhe It is true that the sources cover Catholic issues, but only the Salvatorian one is actually published by a Catholic institution. I need not go into how varied Catholic newspapers are in their adherence/faithfulness to the Catholic hierarchy and beliefs (see e.g. National Catholic Reporter versus National Catholic Register). But more direclty, there actually are many scholarly RS that discussion Pfeiffer and his works in Nazi-occupied Rome. You will find them on the other language versions of this article. The problem is that I do not read Italian or German well enough to use them in the article. Coverage is not the issue. It is English language coverage. Ergo Sum 13:48, 17 October 2021 (UTC) @Ergo Sum: perhaps add the word "reportedly" before "saved". I'm inclined to accept in good faith the sources used as reliable – none of them have not been deprecated nor deemed generally unreliable. —Bloom6132 (talk) 16:41, 26 October 2021 (UTC) DYK should not cover unconfirmed reports or rumors so I strongly disagree with that suggestion. As well as assuming sources are reliable if they've never been discussed at WP:RSN, which disregards important parts of WP:RS such as WP:CONTEXTMATTERS. There is no issue with citing sources in Italian or German, but if it's not confirmed that they support the content then it's incorrect to assume that they do. (t · c) buidhe 20:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Bloom6132: I tend to think that statements are either supported by RS and written in wikivoice or they're not accepted at all. For that reason, I shy away from words like "reportedly." I reiterate though that I think it's quite clear there's nothing wrong with the sources currently used. They're all RS, so that should be the end of it. Hence, why I think your initial review was satisfactory. Ergo Sum 23:40, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Ergo Sum: agreed. I'm still of the view that the hook satisfies criteria 3b. Criteria 4 states that "Nominations should be rejected if an inspection reveals that they are not based on reliable sources". That is not the case here. —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) You're still ignoring the principle in RS that context matters, and some sources are reliable for some but not other info. The two of us who actually write on Holocaust related topics have expressed that the sources cited are not reliable for the exceptional claims being made. (t · c) buidhe 23:59, 26 October 2021 (UTC) With all due respect, I am of the opinion that the sources used are reliable for the info in the hook. The fact that you and Brigade Piron write on Holocaust-related topics is irrelevant – it does not confer a veto over hooks pertaining to that subject. By that logic, I should be able to veto baseball or heraldry hooks ... —Bloom6132 (talk) 01:10, 27 October 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: Three of my DYKs promoted (including Coat of arms of the Falkland Islands from August this year) have included the word "reportedly" in the hook, as well as numerous hooks from other editors. Disagree all you want – this is accepted practice at DYK. —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: I'm aware that you have experience writing about Holocaust-related articles and I put value in your assessment as a solid editor. However, I'm quite comfortable in my ability to vet RS, as well, and my confidence in these sources means I must disagree with your opinion here. Experienced editors do disagree at times, and it is my opinion that I think you have gotten this one wrong; doubtless, you think the same for me. I haven't seen any evidence that these are not RS. Therefore, I recommend if Bloom6132 is inclined to do so, to renew their approval of the hook. In the meantime, I'm going to request the input of additional experienced editors on the DYK talk page. Ergo Sum 01:28, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm going to ping @Bamse, Bermicourt, Jmabel, and Anyfile to see if we can find some reliable sources in other languages. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 01:46, 27 October 2021 (UTC) Oops, @AnyFile theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 01:47, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm currently traveling & very busy, so not much help here, I'm afraid. - Jmabel | Talk 01:53, 27 October 2021 (UTC) That said, more or less this same case is made in The Pope's Jews: The Vatican's Secret Plan to Save Jews from the Nazis by Gordon Thomas (not currently cited in the article). - Jmabel | Talk 02:00, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm unclear as to why the cited sources are unreliable: are we assuming that all information emanating from a Roman Catholic source is unreliable? If so what's the logic? In any case there are dozens of book sources in English, German, French and Italian that mention Pfeiffer, the problem is that few are accessible online. One is an entire biography of Pfeiffer "from baker to Vatican diplomat" which would be useful to track down: Willer, Philomena (2005). P. Pankratius Pfeiffer SDS: (1872-1945); vom Bäckergesellen zum Vatikandiplomat. Pub: Josef Fink. Others that mentions Pfeiffer and the Jews in Rome are: Liebhart (1996) Schwangau. Meding (1992), Flucht vor Nürnberg. Sinn (1976), Illegal. Bermicourt (talk) 08:41, 27 October 2021 (UTC) My issue is with the unreliability of journalistic works and popular history, which have in many cases published inaccurate information about rescues of Jews during the Holocaust. If better sources exist, they should be cited instead. An additional question is, do these sources actually support the claim of "hundreds" of Jews rescued by Pfeiffer personally? (t · c) buidhe 08:51, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I've now found sources that cover most of the article. Here are more: Liebhart (1996) Schwangau. Meding (1992), Flucht vor Nürnberg. Sinn (1976), Illegal. Prince Constantine of Bavaria (1952) Der Papst. Layer (1985), Schwäbisches Ehrenbuch - Pfeiffer credited with "saving Rome and other Italian cities including Chieti, Ascoli and Ovieto from destruction and other calamities" _ (1999). Publik-Forum - Pfeiffer the only German to have a street named after him in Rome and who fought to save Roman Jews. _ (1960). Bayerische Frömmigkeit - Pfeiffer described as the "Saviour of Rome and other cities in Italy" Robert Katz has written a number of books - Death in Rome (1967), Black Sabbath (1969), The Battle for Rome (2010) - which all mention Pfeiffer. Bottum and Dalin (2004). The Pius War has this interesting piece: "7. Pancrazio [sic] Pfeiffer. According to Carroll-Abbing, one of the men used by Pius XII to protest the Nazi roundup of Rome's Jews and intervene for persecuted victims was Father Pancrazio Pfeiffer, superior general of the Salvatorian Fathers, who also served as Pius XII' personal liaison to the German military command in Rome. Because Pfeiffer died tragically in an automobile accident toward the end of the war and thus never took part in the postwar analysis of Pius XII's conduct, many historians have overlooked him. But those who knew him or have researched his life have chronicled his collaborative efforts with Pius XII to rescue Jews and others during the war. See the article "Pfeiffer's List" by Robert Graham, 30 Days, June 1994, pp. 42-46. Prince Constantine of Bavaria's book on Pius XII, The Pope (London: Allan Wingate, 1954) [listed above] contains an excellent section on Pfeiffer, whom he describes as an agent for the pope on behalf of the victims of persecution and the fugitives in hiding" (p. 213). At Pfeiffer's death in May 1945, Vatican Radio paid tribute: "He came into contact with the Commander of the German occupying forces [in Rome in 1943-44]. From that day onwards, he placed his religious and spiritual qualities at the service of many who had been arrested or already condemned to death. He helped countless people in this way, and saved their lives, among them many Jews and other Italian personages. He championed..." In short there seems to be book evidence for virtually everything stated in the article apart from the specific details of the two incidents where 249 or 400 Jews were rescued. Based on my initial searches my expectation is that those incidents are likely to be recorded in the literature - we just need to be able to access more of the sources. Meanwhile there is no harm in pausing to use some of the above sources, plus those I've added to the Further reading section of the article in order to reinforce the existing references and then review where we are.

For example, Salvatorians USA Province is not independent of the article subject and therefore is not reliable for self-serving assertions such as "he saved many Jews in Rome from persecution and ultimately death" or "Every day, Pfeiffer visited the Regina Coeli prison and another prison on Via Tasso, where he would often return with freed prisoners who had been sentenced to death." (t · c) buidhe 08:27, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: would you still object if the article instead relied on the sources found by Bermicourt? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 04:58, 5 November 2021 (UTC) Depends, the Samerski source looks reliable to me but the book published by "Österreichische Provinz der Salvatorianer" has the same issue of close connection to the article subject. (t · c) buidhe 06:27, 5 November 2021 (UTC) All right. @Ergo Sum: I'm not going to promote the nomination without consensus to move forward, so if you want to try and rework the article's sourcing to approval, that can work.

Ergo Sum 15:45, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I have added several inline citations to the article, which refer to sources that were (very helpfully) added by Bermicourt. These sources support several of the very specific claims in the article, as well as the general thrust of the article which is in dispute here, namely that Pfeiffer was a liaison and in that capacity saved many Jews and others from the Nazis. In light of these reliable sources supporting the general claims, I think any concern about the pre-existing ones describing some of his more specific actions is ameliorated. There is a trove of additional sources in the Further Reading section that additionally describe in much greater detail Pfeiffer's actions but they are either in a foreign language which I do not adequately read to make use of as citations or are offline. All being said, I think there is now ample sourcing to back up the article's claims. Ergo Sum 05:49, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks, Ergo Sum—@Buidhe:, if this sourcing is up to your standards, we can move ahead. If not, we're probably going back to WT:DYK and asking for more eyes. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 05:52, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Hi, I've flagged the specific content in the article that supports the hook as needing a better source. There are other active cleanup tags on the article as well. However, I think there's sufficient sourcing for a modified version of the hook without the words "hundreds of". (t · c) buidhe 06:06, 17 November 2021 (UTC) We could cite "countless" using the ref above instead of "hundreds of". Bermicourt (talk) 08:33, 17 November 2021 (UTC) According to the source it's what Vatican Radio said about him after his death. DYK is not for eulogies imo. (t · c) buidhe 08:37, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I'm not following—is the source unreliable because it's after his death? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 08:40, 17 November 2021 (UTC) No, it's because it's Catholic presumably... We could always add "according to Vatican Radio..." But better still, we just need to cite the exact text from one of the many non-Catholic book sources and the problem will be solved. Bermicourt (talk) 08:46, 17 November 2021 (UTC) And yet another source: O'Reilly (2001) in Forgotten Battles: Italy's War of Liberation 1943-45 states that "the Vatican was able to assist many of Rome's Jews and others sought by the Germans through Father Pancrazio Pfeiffer's intervention with the Germans... His work was recounted by Robert Graham who has written extensively on the Vatican's role in World War II." Bermicourt (talk) 09:01, 17 November 2021 (UTC) And another: Bartley (2016) in Catholics Confronting Hitler states that "Father Pancrace [sic] Pfeiffer, a German priest and the superior general of the Salvatorian Order, was the pope's liaison with the German military. Several hundred hostages, including some under sentence of death, owed their release to the efficacious intervention of Father Pfeiffer." I don't know why I'm doing this - you can look up the references yourselves instead of opining and speculating from the sidelines in the classic Wikipedia way. :) Bermicourt (talk) 09:08, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @Bermicourt: Since it seems you have access to several sources that I do not (probably just requires further digging), would you want to add them as inline citations with page numbers, especially to support the proposition regarding hundreds of people saved?

I'd be in favor instead of the hook being split into two separate proposals: one hook about the fact that she was an internet celebrity who grew up in a place without tap water, and a separate hook about her going viral for making hamburgers. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:23, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Full review needed, which can also address the issue of the borderline ALT1 hook. BlueMoonset (talk) 04:23, 5 November 2021 (UTC) As far as I can tell the article meets DYK requirements, and a QPQ has been done. Earwigs finds a close match with Coda Media, but that's only because it was the source for quotes in the article, and all of them are properly referenced. I find the first hook hard to believe given China's international standing, and in any case as brought up by Bowlhover may be inaccurate anyway. As for the second hook, as I mentioned before it's ineligible as it's exactly 200 characters long, and per WP:DYK hooks that are at or shorter than 200 characters may be rejected per reviewer's discretion. Both ALT0 and ALT1 have struck: I am repeating my earlier suggestion that ALT1 instead be split into two separate hooks. As this is a China-related article and there appear to be some political discussion in the article, I'd also like to ask for a second opinion from someone more knowledgeable about China-related articles if the article doesn't fall afoul of relevant guidelines. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 13:12, 6 November 2021 (UTC) From Wikipedia:Did you know#The hook: The hook should be concise: no more than about 200 characters (including spaces and the question mark, but not including the ..., the space immediately following the ..., or any (pictured)). While 200 is a hard limit, hooks near or at this limit may still be rejected at the discretion of reviewers and administrators. This tool can be used for counting words. The guideline says that "200 is a hard limit", so it is not true that the 200-character ALT1 hook is "ineligible" or "simply too long". No reason has been given for rejecting a 200-character hook "at the discretion of reviewers". Here are two additional hooks based on the suggestion: ALT2: ... that Dianxi Xiaoge, who grew up in a remote Yunnan mountain without running water, is an Internet celebrity with roughly 16 million subscribers on all her platforms? ALT3: ... Dianxi Xiaoge went viral in China and internationally after making hamburgers for her grandparents who had never eaten them before? Cunard (talk) 07:48, 7 November 2021 (UTC) Well for one thing, the original was very difficult to read and seemed to combine too many facts into one hook. Usually DYK prefers simpler hooks whenever possible. In any case, I think ALT3 is the best hook here and the nomination is otherwise good to go, I'd just like to hear a second opinion from another editor on the article tone given that I'm a bit uncomfortable doing a solo review here given the "Commentary" section delves into some political matters. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:36, 7 November 2021 (UTC) On second thought, I have some concerns regarding the length of the article. Isn't it rather detailed for an internet celebrity's page? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 11:10, 7 November 2021 (UTC) That the article is "rather detailed for an internet celebrity's page" should not be a concern. The sources provided substantial analysis of her and her work, and this article reflects those sources. Other detailed articles for Internet celebrities include PewDiePie and MrBeast. Cunard (talk) 11:18, 7 November 2021 (UTC) Pinging Gatoclass for his input, as he responded to a discussion I raised about this nomination over at WT:DYK. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:57, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I don't think we need Gatoclass to restate themself. Here's what they said at WT:DYK: The article doesn't use the phrase "one of only three Chinese influencers to gain international influence", so I'm not sure where you got that, but it does say she is one of only three "Chinese Internet celebrities who have reached international prominence", and the problem with that claim is that it's sourced to an article that is two years old and therefore not up-to-date. With regard to the overall length, I would agree that it is overly detailed and could use a trim. I'm not sure this is relevant to DYK however, as "overly detailed" is not one of our criteria. What I would say is that the level of detail does raise the chances of close paraphrasing so the article would need to be carefully checked for that. Anybody else with an opinion on this article?

Thriley (talk) 20:57, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @Thriley: I'll ping BlueMoonset here in case I'm wrong, but I'm going to say no, it isn't. My reasoning here is that if the hook were read as plaintext, without any bolding or linking, it would be read as pretty much only interesting as it concerns the plot. The hook should concern Smit's life; if it concerns her work as an actress, only stating her role and not anything about production doesn't make the hook out-of-universe. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 21:28, 17 November 2021 (UTC) theleekycauldron, I was taking a look at the ALT1 hook and its sources, and the second Biography sentence is basically copied from Esquire—the Google translate version, at any rate. That's a problem. Another problem is that the source doesn't actually say that she was working as a hotel receptionist when she got the call, just that it was "one of these jobs", referring back to the four in the previous sentence, none of which were hotel receptionist. The article also needs a bit of copyediting. I don't think that either of the plot-based hooks should be used, and as Drmies notes, "first film" is not accurate, since it's Cross the Line that's in the source, which appears to be her fifth film. We could only use "first feature film" if the previous four in her filmography were all short films (which would need to be clearly sourced). Perhaps an angle for the information in ALT1 would be to say she was working in whatever job it was when she was cast in Cross the Line, for which she was nominated as best new actress in the Goya Awards. BlueMoonset (talk) 02:31, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Here’s an article that states she was working as a receptionist two years before she was hired to work on Parallel Mothers:[13] Does it appear reliable?

However, it isn't sufficient to support the "when she was called" hook claim, just that she was a hotel receptionist two years before the article was written (and possibly two years and a number of months, since you can't assume it's exactly two years).

I do like the hooks and it's an intriguing subject for an article! I wanted to flag the following comments, in case they are helpful (please ignore if not!): I don't quite follow this sentence in the lead: "Moreover, it is still pointed out that the emendation Albruna agrees with the names of other Germanic wise women." Should "instriptions" (before the Drusus heading) be "inscriptions"? Should the names of scholars be wikilinked, where there is a page for the author (e.g. Simek)? What does mss mean, and could this be explained when it is first referenced? The second paragraph of the Aurinia section has two sentences starting with "However" in a row, which is a bit awkward to read.

Meets newness and length requirements easily, QPQ done. Earwig brings up the two most-cited sources as potential copyvios. To be expected, since they're cited almost 20 times each, and since the vast majority of the matches concern long quotes I'm willing to overlook it, but can we add more citations throughout the paragraphs? Particularly with "Conflict with Miles and Reynolds", there's four citations crammed at the end of the section. I think we should cite each after the corresponding sentences, especially where there's a direct quotation. Also for ALT0 we need a citation at the ends of the sentences for "Golden Boy" and "Whiz Kid". Otherwise nice read, and good use of sources.

Its long enough and new and lots of good refs - including the hook fact. It documents a notable woman from the 14th century and there were not many of those. There is no image, its well written and I offer an alternative phrasing of the hook, but its up to someone else to decide if its ok. No evidence of close paraphrasing I could see. Nice addition. well done Victuallers (talk) 10:31, 6 November 2021 (UTC) Reopening this because I think the hook is misleading, as according to the source it was usual for women of the nobility, like Neville, to sign with their own names. Gatoclass (talk) 02:10, 19 November 2021 (UTC) @Gatoclass: I don't think most will know that, so maybe we go with ALT1 or some variation on it? We don't need to say it's unusual if we phrase it that way theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 02:14, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Theleekycauldron, the problem with both hooks is that they imply that there was something out-of-the-ordinary in a woman signing something in her own name in that era, whereas the source indicates that was normal practice for women of the nobility. So the hooks are misleading. Gatoclass (talk) 02:19, 19 November 2021 (UTC) All right—I'll ping @Lajmmoore and Victuallers: back here, y'all can work this out. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 02:33, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Was it usual for women in the fourteenth century to sign with their own name ... no. Is is usual for women in the 21st century to sign with just their first name? No. So "did you know that unusually Canada's head of state signs documents with just her first name and an R for Regina?" (Someone shouts) "BUT all British Queens do that!!" (Someone shouts) "That implies that it was unusual for Queens to sign with just their first name." No it doesnt. I think @Gatoclass: is reading the source and then saying that the hook doesnt explain every piece of information in the source... which obviously it doesnt. Its unusual that "a woman" is doing this at all. It WAS unusual for women in the fourteenth century to sign and if they did then they did not usually use just their own name. Its a fact - its unusual. Did You know that women did not sign their own names on documents in the 14th century? No I didnt. That is something that Lajmmoore wrote about and now I know. Thanks. Victuallers (talk) 08:28, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Hello Gatoclass all so the part of the source I was using is this, which is talking about signatures for charitable donation "Although most of the widows declare themselves to be the wife of their late husband, or their father's daughter, others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names, such as 'domina Margareta de Longvl' and 'don-ýina Margareta de Nevill' (the same person). The majority of widows declare that their marital status and their power to act, using a variety of phrases, including 'in pura viduitate', 'in pura viduitate mea et ligia potestate', and 'in viduitate mea propria et potestate legitima' ..." and I read that as it was more usual for (noble) women to use a signature that described them as "wife of, etc..." I read the passage as Legg using Margaret de Neville as an unusual example. Legg is talking about the Coucher Book signatures specifically, but I still think they are marking out unusual practice. In terms of the hook, I wonder whether changing 'woman' to 'literate woman' might work? Lajmmoore (talk) 09:32, 19 November 2021 (UTC) No, it wouldn't work just to add "literate". And your reading of the text just amounts to an unsupported assumption on your part. Because while the text could admittedly be less ambiguous, the statement that others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names does not in any way suggest that it was rare or unusual for a member of the nobility to give their name, it only states that members of the nobility as a class were inclined to give their names. So there isn't sufficient support in that statement for a hook which implies that Neville's act was in any way unusual for a member of her class. The hook makes Neville sound like some sort of proto-feminist who boldly challenged the system, when the underlying source only indicates that either her entire class did the same thing, or at least that it was an accepted practice for members of the nobility. So I still think that either the hook needs to be substantially reworked to more closely reflect the source, or a new hook be found. Gatoclass (talk) 02:53, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks for sharing your interpretation of your text Gatoclass. My interpretation (& so the hook) is based on Legg's use of the word most - in that "most of the widows declare themselves to be the wife of their late husband, or their father's daughter" and you rightly point out "others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names" but I think that needs to be balanced by the "most" earlier in the sentence i.e. for women generally, they don't give their name, but some noble women do but overall, for women signing their name, it is unusual enough to be pointed out in the text.

Whispyhistory (talk) 06:32, 13 November 2021 (UTC) I don't see that exact sequence of numbers in the source, although there are others that look a bit like an IP address. The trouble is, the nominator seems to be the source for it looking a bit like an IP address, which it does, but we can't use that unless the source makes a similar point, which it does not appear to do. Something like this might work (numbers might need to be changed as mentioned): ALT1 ... that a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone may be described as 88.5.3.2? Philafrenzy (talk) 10:16, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Regarding the image, it's a fun idea but I don't think we run images as quizzes and the image is simply a skeletal foot, and not closely enough related to the hook.

I don't see how the hook you're suggesting is hooky. What exactly is wrong with the hook proposed? It's in the article and it's supported by the sources cited. And the image is directly related to the hook. It engages the reader into a spotting game. Dr. Vogel (talk) 14:57, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Like everyone else, I rather like the IP-address hook. If we wikilinked IP address, it would be supported in the linked articles, and fulfill the requirement that anyone following the links will be able to verify the hook. I don't think we need sourcing that says that a specific sequence of numbers is an IP address, as we have sources giving the general format of an IP address, and creating an example would be a trivial calculation ("Are all four of these numbers separated by periods in the range 0-255?"): "IPv4 and IPv6 address formats". www.ibm.com. An IPv4 address has the following format: x . x . x . x where x is called an octet and must be a decimal value between 0 and 255. Octets are separated by periods. An IPv4 address must contain three periods and four octets. The following examples are valid IPv4 addresses: 1 . 2 . 3 . 4 01 . 102 . 103 . 104 This hook is better than any alternative I can think of, and I don't see anything likely to be problematic about it (it's certainly verifiable). I think we might be in agreement on that? So if some rule technically prohibits it, we might have a good case for applying the WP:Ignore all the rules policy. Broken finger is also currently DYK-eligible and I think it uses the same numbering scheme.[1] HLHJ (talk) 02:07, 14 November 2021 (UTC) [edit: add fulltext url] I don't necessarily agree with the reading of WP:DYKCRIT 3b ( Each fact in the hook must be supported in the article by at least one inline citation to a reliable source [...]) that says that the IP thing needs to be in the article (compare e.g. Template:Did you know nominations/Urine deflector, which similarly took some creative licence in how the proposed hooks were phrased beyond what was stated in either the article or the cited source), and I agree with HLHJ that WP:IAR would be applicable regardless. As for the hooks themselves, writing "a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone may be described as 88.5.3.2" is a much poorer way of writing the hook (less "hooky") than the converse, i.e. "88.5.3.2 may refer to a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone". TompaDompa (talk) 11:28, 14 November 2021 (UTC) This. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 17:01, 16 November 2021 (UTC) We can't use IP address because the nominator just thought it up "oh, that looks like an IP address". It's not in the source as the nominator admits and therefore is not verifiable. And so what if it does look like an IP address? What does that tell us about broken toes? I like clever or quirky hooks and have written many (if I may say so), but they have to be based on something in the sources otherwise it's things made up one day. Philafrenzy (talk) 10:19, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you for all your comments. This is not the place to ignore all rules. The proposed hook is not supported by the source given in the article. I am inclined to approve ALT1 but it needs checking, unless another hook is proposed. Whispyhistory (talk) 15:11, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Oh dear, this has become contentious. I think the contended question is whether it's acceptable to have verified information not found in the nominated article, but only in another article, linked in the hook. Not as hooky, but for illustration: ALT3 ... that the dot-decimal notation string "88.5.3.2" is not only an an IPv4 address, but also a fracture in the middle of the bone at the tip of the little toe? "IPv4 and IPv6 address formats". www.ibm.com., Hallux proximal phalanx fracture in adults: an overlooked diagnosis I don't think we're debating whether the IP-address-hook statement is verifiable. The statement that "88.5.3.2" (and any number in that format) is a valid IPv4 address is supported by the IP address article and the IPv4 article, and this format is the subject of the Dot-decimal notation article. No-one had bothered to cite those statements in those articles, but since they've been challenged here, I've now cited them. So "88.5.3.2 is both an IP address[1] and a code for a broken toebone[2]" is certainly verifiable, and is now verified on Wikipedia. Any DYK reader should have no trouble verifying that the hook is accurate. Alternatives that do not mention IP addressees are not as hooky, but don't contain more information about broken toes: ALT4 ... that "88.5.3.2" is a toe fracture in the middle of the bone at the tip of the little toe, while a "78.5.3.2" is the parallel broken finger?

Philafrenzy (talk) 19:25, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you Philafrenzy ( a very experienced DYK contributor) for your efforts in helping new editors understand DYK. Your comment higher up about "88.5.3.2" and "ip address" not being in the source is true and I am grateful for your suggested alts. Essentially, the initial and subsequent hooks sound good, but none are in the article or the source. I don't wish for personal comments and don't mind if someone else wishes to take over here. With due respect @DrVogel: and @HLHJ:...You may wish to take this up at Wikipedia talk:Did you know. Whispyhistory (talk) 10:41, 15 November 2021 (UTC) I won't say I wish I hadn't written the article; I hope it's useful enough to make up for the social harm to the project here. I don't think the hostility was intended by anyone; I suspect that it's felt partly due to the ease of mininterpretation in a text-only medium and partly due to human cognitive biases.[2] I certainly did, and do, not intend it. I spent a day's editing trying to resolve the conflict by finding references specifically saying that the two things were in notation X and adding that text to the article, but unfortunately non-inductive descriptions of the notations seem to have been considered so needless that an Internet RFC attempting to formalize them died of disinterest. I did find a source that explicitly defines the IPv4 format, and one that explicitly says that 88.1.2.2 is a specific fracture, and I've cited the latter in the article, but I don't think this helps. It is probably a bit unreasonable to expect a reviewer to do more than apply rules as best they can, and Wikipedia talk:Did you know might indeed be a better forum for a more detailed discussion. I don't really want to take part in one, though (nothing to do with this discussion, prior reasons). I posted because I felt responsible for the conflict and thought I might be able to help. My impression is that I made it worse; my apologies to everyone I've offended. HLHJ (talk) 03:41, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Nobody is offended, but if I may say so I think you are still missing the point. IP addresses have nothing to do with broken toes even if that notation may have a similarity. That's why the sources don't make the comparison and why the IP-based hooks are no good. Any of the other hooks might be fine (I haven't checked the numbers) just without the bit about IP addresses. The whole thing reminds me of unusually shaped vegetables where you may see a carrot shaped like a foot, people who see faces in clouds, and even apophenia. My personal observation that one thing looks a bit like another is not the basis for a hook unless reliable sources make the point too. Philafrenzy (talk) 09:09, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Folks, we are wasting a wonderful hook. Really. IP addresses have nothing to do with broken toes even if that notation may have a similarity and that is the whole point of making good hooks. They are supposed to be short, punchy, catchy, and likely to draw the readers in to wanting to read the article – as long as they don't misstate the article content. And one of the best recipes to make a hook good is to make it sound counterintuitive With any other option but the original, we are bound to receive another hook frequented by maybe a few hundred visitors. I would propose something to the tune of in some contexts, 88.5.3.2 might not mean an IP address but a broken bone in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone? so that no one claims here that we somehow delegitimise the IP address but at the same time so that we preserve the core of the hook. As for the claims that because the hook is not cited in the IP part, it can't be there - please don't be that pedantic. In our today's world of informatics we may assume that people who visit Wikipedia more or less imagine what IP addresses are, and may more or less imagine how they look like (in the worst case they will visit the article for details). The other part is cited. I see no problem with the original. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 17:01, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Szmenderowiecki I admit that I'm not very familiar with the topic, and the above discussion was confusing, but is the "this isn't an IP address" claim actually in the source? Because if it's not, then no matter how good the hook proposal is, it can't be used in a hook since hook facts need to be based on a reference. Also, I'm pretty sure that assumptions don't count as sources. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:31, 17 November 2021 (UTC) What I was leading is that we don't need to cite that the sky is blue, or that we have five fingers; or that there exist IP addresses for that matter. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 11:08, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Given that these IP number hooks aren't working out so far, I wonder if some other hooks unrelated to that could be proposed here. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 02:11, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Comment only If we accept the first hook we will end up with thousands of hits, some quiet smiles and some who will continue to believe that DYK broke the rules. We're allowed to. This is not a massive occasion where we can save the whole project by breaking the rules. Its a trivial example of what some (not all) think may be a breach in the rules, with a small, but amusing, advantage. So I'm not asking the defenders of the rules to admit that this is not a breech ... I am suggesting that they might just concede that the harm done by allowing this hook might not offend anyone ... and it might please a few thousand. Victuallers (talk) 15:28, 20 November 2021 (UTC) We don't need to break the rules. The observation that the notation looks a bit like an IP address is trivial and completely unrelated to broken toes. There are already perfectly good hooks above that work better. Nobody is saying don't use the numbers, just strike the bit about IP addresses. The originally proposed hook is not the work of comic genius and cleverness that some seem to think it is. Philafrenzy (talk) 21:58, 20 November 2021 (UTC) The main issue here is that it's one of the core rules of DYK that hook facts must be mentioned in the article, ideally explicitly or at least implied by supporting information. The thing is that at the moment, IP addresses are not mentioned anywhere in the article, so the hooks using the IP address angle would be ineligible according to that criterion anyway. Even April Fools hooks, which tend to be misleading, are still generally based on hook facts that are mentioned in the respective articles. So if we can't even grant IAR exemptions for that criterion for AFD hooks, the one day of the year where our hooks tend to follow the rules most loosely, I can't see why such a request should be granted here.

Nominated by Victuallers (talk) at 16:21, 6 November 2021 (UTC). Article is new enough. Two correct writers are credited. The article is fully referenced. No copyvio detected. There is a bit of biased POV pushing in Wikipedia voice: "most vulnerable to climate change". This will be something our subject is saying no doubt. And this idea is also reflected in the hook with "endangered". The hook content is referenced and confirmed by the Guardian, apart from the "endangered" bit, which opinion is attributed to Tina Stege. So I suggest that "endangered" is taken out of the hook, or it is reworded so it is clear she is saying that. Hook alt1 is unsuitable as it does not link the article and I cannot tell what it is trying to say in relation to the subject. I can confirm image is CC-BY-3.0 as derived from the video with CC-BY-3.0 license. However I would suggest that a different image is selected from the video, perhaps near the end where the microphone is not obscuring her chin. QPQ is done.

Self-nominated at 23:51, 4 November 2021 (UTC). @DferDaisy: This article is about 3300 bytes, and was nominated for DYK shortly after creation, satisfying date and length criteria. There is a factual error, as the article states she was interred in Keokuk, Illinois, but the source says she died in Chicago, Illinois and was interred in Keokuk, Iowa. I am assuming good faith for a few references I cannot access (for example, ref 15 - The National Humane Review), which for me gives a landing page for the document, instead of an inside view). Otherwise, everything is properly sourced and there are no copyvio or close paraphrasing concerns (Earwig cites 3 potential problems, but they are not an issue here.) QPQ not required. Regarding the hooks, ALT0 is incorrect as stated, as it reads as if the study was conducted in the early 1900s by Meigs Crowder, whereas she published it in 1917 based on studies from that period. It'll need minor alteration. ALT1 is fine and sourced. I would prefer to promote an amended ALT0. A minor quibble, though not an issue for DYK: please add page numbers for cited sources. If online access is eliminated from the sources, it'll force anyone investigating those sources to wade through too many pages to find the desired detail.

AleatoryPonderings (???) (!!!) 01:52, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @AleatoryPonderings: Yes, but note that this court case is the "leading case with respect to the issue of common employers", establishing a precedent in Canadian law. At the time the lawsuit was filed, this was not the case, and in fact the trial judge ruled against Alouche (see last paragraph of background section); it was only after the case was brought to the Court of Appeal for Ontario that the "common employer doctrine" was established, and it became entrenched when leave to appeal the decision at the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed. Mindmatrix 15:11, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Ah, so the idea behind the hook is that, since Downtown Eatery changed the law on common employers, before Downtown Eatery Best Beaver would not have been Alouche's employer? That makes more sense. AleatoryPonderings (???) (!!!) 15:20, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: I'm going to inspect this again... Mindmatrix 15:18, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @AleatoryPonderings: Alright, so to ensure everything is correct, the following timeline occurred: Alouche was hired to be manager at For Your Eyes Only (owned by Grad and Grosman), and began work on 29 December 1992 Alouche was sent a Notice of Discipline in May 1993, and was fired on 15 June 1993 In October 1993, Alouche filed action for wrongful dismissal against Best Beaver Management Inc., as that was the source of his paycheques Best Beaver ceased operations in mid-1996, and all assets distributed to other companies owned by Grad and Grosman The trial resolved in favour of Alouche Best Beaver did not pay out the judgement (all its assets had been redistributed) Sherriffs were dispatched to For Your Eyes Only, where they seized $1,855 Downtown Eatery filed claim against Alouche, stating the cash belonged to it Alouche defended, and counterclaimed against Grad, Grosman, and all companies they controlled on the grounds of common employer doctrine, the oppression remedy of the Ontario Business Corporations Act, and fraudulent conveyance the judge in the second trial (at Ontario Superior Court of Justice) ruled against Alouche the case was brought to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, where the previous ruling was overturned in 2001 in January 2002, an application for leave to appeal the decision at the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed So, the common employer doctrine was part of the second trial as a counterclaim to the suit filed by Downtown Eatery. I just wanted to ensure this satisfies your concerns. Mindmatrix 18:25, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks for this incredibly thorough response. My concern is maybe philosophical or definitional. If I say that company A employs person B, that has an ordinary meaning and a legal meaning. It is probably right that Best Beaver did not employ Alouche in the ordinary sense of "employ", because Best Beaver was a "paymaster" and not the name on the front of the building where he went to work. My reading of the case itself is that, before Downtown Eatery, it was at best indeterminate as a legal matter whether Best Beaver, alone or in combination with its affiliate companies, employed Alouche. After Downtown Eatery, it was established—as a matter of legal meaning, but not necessarily ordinary meaning—that Best Beaver was his employer, or part of his employer, or something like that. The reason I brought this up is that it's not clear how one could verify the claim that "Best Beaver was not Alouche's employer", because that claim might be true as a matter of ordinary meaning but the only authoritative legal ruling we have on this (namely, Downtown Eatery) holds that the claim is false. In any event, I'll leave this to the eventual reviewer to sort out. I find my brain twisting into knots. AleatoryPonderings (???)

However, it includes a WP:IMDB source and I am unsure about the reliability of several other sources, including Film Ink, Queer Media Matters, Antaeus.org, Fern TV, Addicted to Horror Movies, Dan's Papers, Go Mag, Three Women in a Box and North Coast Rep. To add to that, the YouTube link does not appear to be uploaded by an official channel, making it unreliable. Additionally, per MOS:FILMCAST uncredited roles need a source. the copyvio checker showed up a 50%+ similarity with a source, which may suggest over quotation. On top of that, the subject has unclear notability. I'm unsure which roles are significant and The House on Pine Street appears to have a questionable notability. None of her awards seem significant and I'm not seeing any significant coverage from reliable, independent sources. ALT0 isn't very interesting given the festival is not significant enough to have an article. I think ALT1 is interesting but it seems to focus more on the character, not the actress which isn't exactly ideal... QPQ not needed. We'll need some work but we'll get there!

I personally find this fact interesting because it highlights how the advent of YouTube, and internet fame in general, has allowed people to use their voice to reach people in positions of high influence, bringing hidden ideas to light and advocating for change. While this specific example falls under a video game/pop-culture category, and may not fit Wikipedia’s desire for academic material, I feel that this is interesting enough to share, as it’s one the gaming community can relate to, like with other social media trends such as #FreeSmash and "Rerelease Mother 3." As for the article itself, all of the citations should be reliable enough; they’re all from third-party/secondary source outlets and there isn’t any BLP violation to be found here. One concern I have is criteria #3 - “Each fact in the hook must be supported in the article by at least one inline citation to a reliable source, appearing no later than the end of the sentence(s) offering that fact. Citations at the end of the paragraph are not sufficient.” While the hook is sourced in the article, the refs are at the end of the section rather than per each sentence. I can fix that however.

You'd need to have expanded the text content by 5x in length, which I am not seeing in the page history. You'll also need to resolve the many tags for additional citations and expansion in the article. Your best bet would be to get it to good article status and renominate then.

Kaleeb18 (talk) 16:28, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Hi Kaleeb18, no worries and good luck with the article. The expansion is based on the number of characters (ie. letters, spaces etc.) in the article before you started work on it and the number after you've finished.

Newness requirement satisfied by 5x expansion on 11/15 from < 600 to > 3000 characters. Articles also long enough and compliant with core policies on citations and neutrality. The hook is in-line sourced. Photo has appropriate license. QPQ is done. There are, however, two problems: (1) There is some significant overlap with this source. To start, the following sentence is taken from the source without use of quotation marks and with no effort to paraphrase rather than use the precise words: "Local advocacy led to the establishment of Bridle Trails as a state park in 1932." Further, this sentence also strikes me as too closely drawn from the same source: "Initial park development dates to 1933 when Civil Works Administration employees and federal relief workers were employed in state parks as part of the New Deal program. Further work included burning logging debris, clearing brush and building trails and fences." Work needs to be done to put the material into your own words. (2) The hook strikes me as boring in that it states an obvious point. Horses having the right of way on this trail is not unique or special. On trails that are shared by humans and horses, it is the general rule that horses have the right of way. See here ("In general, horses always have the right of way, followed by hikers, then by bikers."). See also here ("For safety reasons, if you come across a horse and rider on any trail they always have right of way. Hikers and bike riders all yield to horses.") To include this on the main page, we really need something that is hooky or interesting about this trail.

For one, the quote is not actually "could have been made by aliens" so, considering this is all about misquotation, we should either use the actual quote or clarify that it is a misquotation.

Graham87 09:41, 18 November 2021 (UTC) @Gerda Arendt: Thank you for the review. Diamonds were often cut in cabochon style in the 19th century and earlier. This one was cut with a flat bottom like all cabochons, and when viewed from above, it was a large oval, about 1.5 inches long. Modern cabochons usually have a smoothly rounded surface; this one was lightly faceted but the facets don't show on the sculpture. So it looks like half an egg, I suppose. The Koh-i-Noor is the large oval at the bottom of the picture. We have no specific citation for artistic licence - that is just a conclusion that we can probably make, since we have no evidence that Victoria ever had it set in a necklace. Therefore I cannot use "artistic licence" in a hook or in the article. I'll have a go at a hook using a full-length Victoria, and another hook using the Warrior and Wounded Youth sculpture.

Self-nominated at 22:50, 16 November 2021 (UTC). @Ritchie333: Article is a new, plagiarism free, neutral, and well sourced not-stub (1633B). As for the hooks, I'm going to reject ALT0 out of hand, because Ben Comeau can take a number on that one. I'm also going to say no to ALT1, not because it's uncivil or uninteresting, but because it should be quoted—I've suggested two minor alts. A QPQ is also needed. Let me know what you think—nice work! — Preceding unsigned comment added by Theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) 02:57, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Re 1a, I don't see how we know that Comeau personally thinks of Trump; these could have been works-for-hire, after all. I've been trying to come up with something catchy on this -- for example, had Comeau invited Trump to participate in a performance of the work, then we could say he told Trump to fugue himself -- but the sourcing just isn't there that I can see. In consolation, here's an enlightening bit of musical history you will want to share with friends and family: Q: Why did Bach have so many children?

EEng 16:47, 17 November 2021 (UTC) The video for "Boris Johnson is a Lying Shit" includes a description from Comeau that basically screams for people not to vote for him, and the one for "Donald Trump is a Wanker" says "As satisfying as it is to poke fun at the Orange Monster, this video on its own probably won’t do the teeniest thing to reduce the devastation inflicted by the Trump administration. I therefore want to use this platform to suggest ways we can contribute to meaningful anti-Trump resistance.". We'd need to flesh out the article with these WP:BLPPRIMARY sources for the "thinks" to be properly verifiable. Moving on, 1a and 1b don't have as much impact or quirkiness you can get with a good hook.

Self-nominated at 07:56, 17 November 2021 (UTC). The article as it stands consists of about 1430 bytes (excluding infobox, headers, tables, and ref markers). This is slightly too short for DYK. Nominated for DYK less than one day after conversion from redirect. QPQ completed. I'll complete the review once the article satisfies the length criterion. Mindmatrix 20:30, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you for checking the length properly, I apologize for this being slightly off and I have increased it now by adding background info. I await the rest of your comments, hopefully this reaches the DYK page soon enough! K. Peake 21:51, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @Kyle Peake: Article is now of sufficient length. The background section states "Vory was revealed to have vocals on multiple songs", but that is drawn from the @TeamKanyeDaily Twitter account, which is operated by fans (ie - it is not an official account). You can instead state that fans collected this info into a tracklist. Please don't use phrases such as "Vory emphasized", "Vory revealed", "The rapper opened up", or "expressing of them collaborating" (see WP:SAID for reasoning). Also, what do you mean by the term 'considered' in "...creating a strong, considered discography..."? (Its in the source as well, and no clearer there.) There are a number of unsourced quotations in the background section; I can see they appear in this XXL piece, which is included at the end of the paragraph, but generally quotations should be cited where they occur (ie - at the end of the quotation or the sentence in which it occurs). The last sentence in the background section is too similar to the source material. The statement "resembling an ascent to heaven" should not be made in Wikipedia's voice - it should be quoted and attributed to the source making that claim. Also, is "delivered harmonies" accurate? Is there a better choice of words than 'delivered'? And is "listening event" just a substitute for "concert", or does it refer to some other event? Regarding the chart performance, VG-Lista for Norway does not include the song, the Billboard US Christian Songs has it at 15, and the Billboard US Gospel Songs returns "Page not found". Hooks are OK and sourced, though I think associating it to Bieber may detract from the intended target of the hook. Mindmatrix 14:49, 21 November 2021 (UTC) I used a different source for the opening sentence about Vory and also changed the content, worked against using language that the guideline opposes, replaced considered with a clearer meaning while axing strong and paraphrasing that sentence, as well as invoking the XXL ref for any sentences with a quote. Variety made the heavens statement, so I attributed it to them and revised the harmonies part. Regarding the charts, I was supposed to add the week 35 URL for Norway but forgot as the old revision shows in the title, I edited the peaks for the charts since I probably misread them and added the new URL for West's Gospel Songs history. Furthermore, I added Bieber in on purpose because I thought it would be interesting that West's group specifically performed it with such a well-known singer.

Further information: Official supplementary guidelines and unofficial guide  Warning: You are not logged in. Please create an account or log in to proceed. Alternatively, you may leave a message at the bottom of the DYK project talk page with the article you would like to nominate and the hook you would like to propose.  Warning: The helper script only works on desktop. Please switch to desktop view to continue. Install the DYK helper script by adding the line {{subst:lusc|User:SD0001/DYK-helper.js}} to your common.js page. Go back to the article, and choose the "DYK" option from the "More" menu (see image). Fill in the form and submit it. Check back periodically to address comments or concerns from the reviewer (it may take several weeks). Manual instructions[edit] Create a subpage for your new DYK suggestion and then list the page below under the date the article was created or the expansion began or it became a good article (not the date you submit it here), with the newest dates at the bottom. Any registered user may nominate a DYK suggestion (if you are not a registered user, please leave a message at the bottom of the DYK project talk page with the details of the article you would like to nominate and the hook you would like to propose); self-nominations are permitted and encouraged. Thanks for participating and please remember to check back for comments on your nomination (consider watchlisting your nomination page). Read these instructions completely before proceeding. For simplified instructions, see User:Rjanag/Quick DYK 2. I. Create the nomination subpage. Enter the article title in the box below and click the button. (To nominate multiple articles together, enter any or all of the article titles.) You will then be taken to a preloaded nomination page. II. Write the nomination. On the nomination page, fill in the relevant information. See Template:NewDYKnomination and {{NewDYKnomination/guide}} for further information. Not every line of the template needs to be filled in. For instance, if you are not nominating an image to appear with your hook, there is no need to fill in the image-related lines. Add an edit summary e.g. "Nominating YOUR ARTICLE TITLE for DYK" and click Publish page. Make sure the nomination page is on your watchlist, so you can follow the review discussion. III. Post at Template talk:Did you know. In the current nominations section find the subsection for the date on which the article was created or on which expansion began (or, if a new Good Article, the date on which it became a GA), not the date on which you make the nomination. At the top of that subsection (before other nominations already there, but below the section head and hidden comment) add {{Did you know nominations/YOUR ARTICLE TITLE}}. Add an edit summary e.g. "Nominating YOUR ARTICLE TITLE for DYK" and click Publish page. Frequently asked questions[edit] How do I write an interesting hook? Successful hooks tend to have several traits. Most importantly, they share a surprising or intriguing fact. They give readers enough context to understand the hook, but leave enough out to make them want to learn more. They are written for a general audience who has no prior knowledge of or interest in the topic area. Lastly, they are concise, and do not attempt to cover multiple facts or present information about the subject beyond what's needed to understand the hook. When will my nomination be reviewed? This page is often backlogged. As long as your submission is still on the page, it will stay there until an editor reviews it. Since editors are encouraged to review the oldest submissions first, it may take several weeks until your submission is reviewed. In the meantime, please consider reviewing another submission (not your own) to help reduce the backlog (see instructions below). Where is my hook? If you can't find the nomination you submitted to this nominations page, it may have been approved and is on the approved nominations page waiting to be promoted. It could also have been added to one of the prep areas, promoted from prep to a queue, or is on the main page. If the nominated hook is in none of those places, then the nomination has probably been rejected. Such a rejection usually only occurs if it was at least a couple of weeks old and had unresolved issues for which any discussion had gone stale. If you think your nomination was unfairly rejected, you can query this on the DYK discussion page, but as a general rule such nominations will only be restored in exceptional circumstances. Instructions for reviewers[edit] Main page: Wikipedia:Did you know/Reviewing guide Any editor who was not involved in writing/expanding or nominating an article may review it by checking to see that the article meets all the DYK criteria (long enough, new enough, no serious editorial or content issues) and the hook is cited. Editors may also alter the suggested hook to improve it, suggest new hooks, or even lend a hand and make edits to the article to which the hook applies so that the hook is supported and accurate. For a more detailed discussion of the DYK rules and review process see the supplementary guidelines and the WP:Did you know/Reviewing guide. To post a comment or review on a DYK nomination, follow the steps outlined below: Look through this page, Template talk:Did you know, to find a nomination you would like to comment on. Click the "Review or comment" link at the top of the nomination. You will be taken to the nomination subpage. The top of the page includes a list of the DYK criteria. Check the article to ensure it meets all the relevant criteria. To indicate the result of the review (i.e., whether the nomination passes, fails, or needs some minor changes), leave a signed comment on the page. Please begin with one of the 5 review symbols that appear at the top of the edit screen, and then indicate all aspects of the article that you have reviewed; your comment should look something like the following: Article length and age are fine, no copyvio or plagiarism concerns, reliable sources are used. But the hook needs to be shortened. If you are the first person to comment on the nomination, there will be a line :* <!-- REPLACE THIS LINE TO WRITE FIRST COMMENT, KEEPING  :* --> showing you where you should put the comment. Save the page. If there is any problem or concern about a nomination, please consider notifying the nominator by placing {{subst:DYKproblem|Article|header=yes|sig=yes}} on the nominator's talk page. Instructions for project members[edit] How to promote an accepted hook[edit] At-a-glance instructions on how to promote an approved hook to a Prep area See Wikipedia:Did you know/Preparation areas for details on verifying a hook's acceptability. Promoters should not promote their own nomination or their own review When promoting hooks intended for a particular date, keep in mind that when the number of available approved nominations exceeds 120 we switch to two sets per day, and when that number drops below 60 we return to one set per day. Check list for nomination review completeness 1) Select a hook from the approved nominations page that has one of these ticks at the bottom post: . 2) Check to make sure basic review requirements were completed. a. Any outstanding issue following needs to be addressed before promoting. 3) Check the article history for any substantive changes since it was nominated or reviewed. 4) Images for the lead slot must be freely licensed. Fair-use images are not permitted. Images loaded on Commons that appear on the Main Page are automatically protected by KrinkleBot. 5) Hook must be stated in both the article and source (which must be cited at the end of the article sentence where stated). 6) Hook should make sense grammatically. 7) Try to vary subject matters within each prep area. 8) Try to select a funny, quirky or otherwise upbeat hook for the last or bottom hook in the set. Steps to add a hook to prep In one tab, open the nomination page of the hook you want to promote. In a second tab, open the prep set you intend to add the hook to. 1) For hooks held for specific dates, refer to "Local update times" section on DYK Queue. a. Completed Prep area number sets will be promoted by an administrator to corresponding Queue number. 2) Copy and paste the hook into a chosen slot. a. Make sure there's a space between ... and that, and a ? at the end. b. Check that there's a bold link to the article. 3) If it's the lead (first) hook, paste the image where indicated at the top of the template. 4) Copy and paste ALL the credit information (the {{DYKmake}} and {{DYKnom}} templates) at the bottom 5) Check your work in the prep's Preview mode. a. At the bottom under "Credits", to the right of each article should have the link "View nom subpage" ; if not, a subpage parameter will need to be added to the DYKmake. 6) Save the Prep page. Closing the DYK nomination page At the upper left Change {{DYKsubpage to {{subst:DYKsubpage Change |passed= to |passed=yes At the bottom Just above the line containing }}<!--Please do not write below this line or remove this line. Place comments above this line.--> insert a new, separate line containing one of the following: To [[T:DYK/P1|Prep 1]] To [[T:DYK/P2|Prep 2]] To [[T:DYK/P3|Prep 3]] To [[T:DYK/P4|Prep 4]] To [[T:DYK/P5|Prep 5]] To [[T:DYK/P6|Prep 6]] To [[T:DYK/P7|Prep 7]] Also paste the same thing into the edit summary. Check in Preview mode. Make sure everything is against a pale blue background (nothing outside) and there are no stray characters, like }}, at the top or bottom. Save. For more information, please see T:TDYK#How to promote an accepted hook. Handy copy sources: To [[T:DYK/P1|Prep 1]] To [[T:DYK/P2|Prep 2]] To [[T:DYK/P3|Prep 3]] To [[T:DYK/P4|Prep 4]] To [[T:DYK/P5|Prep 5]] To [[T:DYK/P6|Prep 6]] To [[T:DYK/P7|Prep 7]] How to remove a rejected hook[edit] Open the DYK nomination subpage of the hook you would like to remove. (It's best to wait several days after a reviewer has rejected the hook, just in case someone contests or the article undergoes a large change.) In the window where the DYK nomination subpage is open, replace the line {{DYKsubpage with {{subst:DYKsubpage, and replace |passed= with |passed=no. Then save the page. This has the effect of wrapping up the discussion on the DYK nomination subpage in a blue archive box and stating that the nomination was unsuccessful, as well as adding the nomination to a category for archival purposes. How to remove a hook from the prep areas or queue[edit] Edit the prep area or queue where the hook is and remove the hook and the credits associated with it. Go to the hook's nomination subpage (there should have been a link to it in the credits section). View the edit history for that page Go back to the last version before the edit where the hook was promoted, and revert to that version to make the nomination active again. Add a new icon on the nomination subpage to cancel the previous tick and leave a comment after it explaining that the hook was removed from the prep area or queue, and why, so that later reviewers are aware of this issue. Add a transclusion of the template back to this page so that reviewers can see it. It goes under the date that it was first created/expanded/listed as a GA. You may need to add back the day header for that date if it had been removed from this page. If you removed the hook from a queue, it is best to either replace it with another hook from one of the prep areas, or to leave a message at WT:DYK asking someone else to do so. How to move a nomination subpage to a new name[edit] Don't; it should not ever be necessary, and will break some links which will later need to be repaired. Even if you change the title of the article, you don't need to move the nomination page. Nominations[edit] Older nominations[edit] Articles created/expanded on September 2[edit] Inger K.

(Proposed as a possible alternative by Cavalryman) ALT3:... that Inger K.

Self-nominated at 14:12, 2 September 2021 (UTC). SportsOlympic has been blocked for sockpuppetry. Created by Cavalryman (talk) General: Article is new enough and long enough New Enough: Y Long Enough: Y Policy compliance: Adequate sourcing: N - Several problems here: Sources: "Olympedia – Inger K. Frith". www.olympedia.org. – this source is of questionable reliability. MRS. INGER FRITH, Olympic Review, 1971 – the link doesn’t work for me and there is inadequate bibliographic information for me to verify what it is. "Danish WW2 Pilots | Inger Kristine Frith (née Pragholm) (1909 - 1981)". www.danishww2pilots.dk. – I am satisfied a website run by Mikkel Plannthin about WWII Danish pilots is generally reliable (he has been published writing about this subject matter) but ... this seems to have been written largely from information gained in this forum thread and there is a big disclaimer at the bottom of this article raising some very significant discrepancies within the entry, which are included as fact in the article. Particularly the rank of Captain which never existed in the WAAF. I feel this raises questions about the reliability of the source. "Inger Frith blazed a trail for women in sports governance". www.insidethegames.biz. March 5, 2021. – looks reliable to me. The third paragraph in the WWII section is uncited. Filling more parameters in Template:Cite web, particularly authorship, would go a long way to presentation. Neutral: Y Free of copyright violations, plagiarism, and close paraphrasing: Y Other problems: N - The article misattributes several statements: likely the highest ranked Danish woman in service during the Second World War – the cited source states that she was the highest ranked that the author is aware of. She became a volunteer in the army in Cape Town and was later accepted for the Air Force – the cited source makes no mention of the Army. Hook eligibility: Cited: N - cites two sources with issues as described above Interesting: Y Other problems: N - perhaps base the hook on excellent insidethegames.biz article, something like “ that after serving in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War, Inger K. Frith became the first woman to lead a major international sporting federation and returned archery to the Olympics?” I have added it as a possible alternate above but am happy to play with it. QPQ: N - Not done Overall: I apologise if I seem to have been very harsh and I could be being very finicky, but the article is very clunky to read, with short little sentences and paragraphs that I feel don’t flow very well. Further, there is no such thing as the “British Air Force”, it is the United Kingdom’s air force or the Royal Air Force. Earwig shows 13.8% match to the Plannthin webpage, but I don’t think it breaches the COPYVIO threshold. Also QPQ is required. Cavalryman (talk) 04:08, 3 September 2021 (UTC). Hello @SportsOlympic: this nomination has been sitting here for almost a week and I can see you have not edited the article, nor have you supplied a QPQ. Are you still interested in pursuing the nomination? Cavalryman (talk) 12:56, 9 September 2021 (UTC). Olympedia are the same people as Sports Reference and is states at WP:Sports as reliable. It’s a pitty you can’t open the second source, is has great and reliable content. So the main issue is that it stated that she was Captain and the naming of the British Air Force? I’m not native English, so I can’t write it in high class English. As that is a problem, I can’t improve it to your satisfactions. I will rename the Air Force name and title of Captain because that might me wrong. Next to that, I don’t like your other option: it not mentioned she had a high rank and she was the first female at an sports federation SportsOlympic (talk) 20:24, 9 September 2021 (UTC) I can find no such reference at WP:Sports but perhaps I am missing something, there has only been one discussion at the reliable source noticeboard WP:Reliable sources/Noticeboard/Archive 335#Olympedia, that being said it is not used to cite anything controversial. Whilst you have made a couple of small fixes, you missed some of the nuance in my comments above particularly those points listed in green. Further, the claim in the hook to be high ranked depends upon if the rank of Captain (which is clearly wrong) is supposed to be an Army or a Navy Captain, a Captain in the Army is not high ranked, Navy is getting up there. As it stands I feel this article is not at the standard required to be featured on the main page, but I am happy for others to take a look at it. Cavalryman (talk) 22:38, 9 September 2021 (UTC). I have not looked at the article but would like to confirm that Olympedia is an authoritative source for Olympic bios. Schwede66 18:15, 13 September 2021 (UTC) Schwede66, many thanks, honestly Olympedia is the least of the issues here. Kind regards, Cavalryman (talk) 22:39, 13 September 2021 (UTC). It has been over a week and the nominator has made very little effort to rectify many of the issues raised above, nor have they supplied a QPQ (I was considering donating a QPQ if issues were rectified). They have received a TP notification [1] and been pinged above, so unfortunately I think this should be marked as ineligible and closed. Cavalryman (talk) 00:44, 17 September 2021 (UTC). Hi Cavalryman, I've done considerable cleanup work on the article, finding published sources for a good bit of the material, and rewriting some parts based on the additions. This one should get a whole new review. Mary Mark Ockerbloom (talk) 06:40, 17 September 2021 (UTC) It might need a new hook too: ALT4:... that after serving as a meteorological officer in the Second World War, Inger K.

DONE Capt. Inger Kristine Frith (nee Pragholm) is recorded as being born on 23 January 1909, and having served (W/265733) in the South African Air Force (SAAF) from 23 October 1941 to 21 July 1945 as a meteorologist/forecaster. Extremely awkward, and leading with Captain gives the impression that she was subsequently demoted to Second Lieutenant in the following paragraph. - reworded She and her husband eventually settled in Crowthorne. Sticks out like a sore thumb, maybe move it into the later life section, as in "died in Crowthorne where she and Ronald had established their home."REMOVED In 1985, she was credited as "the main architect of archery's reintroduction to the Olympic programme in 1972." This quote needs in-text attribution. DONE It's getting closer, with some of the issues raised in the first review have still not been resolved, and care needs to taken to ensure the correct source is used to cite certain pieces of information. I have struck ALT0 because we have now clarified that she was not "a high ranked pilot during World War II". Cavalryman (talk) 04:03, 20 September 2021 (UTC). I have also struck my first ALT1 as she did not serve in the RAF but instead served in the SAAF, so have added ALT2, with no preference between it and ALT4. Cavalryman (talk) 00:48, 21 September 2021 (UTC). ALT numbers amended to reflect added ALT3 above. Cavalryman (talk) 21:46, 5 October 2021 (UTC). Unfortunately, Cavalryman, there were two hooks labeled ALT3. I renamed the second one "ALT4", but you should specify whether you were referring to the first ALT3 or the one now called ALT4. MANdARAX • XA?Ab?AM 21:08, 5 October 2021 (UTC) @Mandarax: yes I can see the second ALT3 was added here, I have amended my comment accordingly. Kind regards, Cavalryman (talk) 21:46, 5 October 2021 (UTC). I have copy-edited the article. She served in both the Women's RAF and the SAAF, but I am not sure that the article needs to be held up over debates about her wartime service. I have proposed an alternative that just focuses on her role in sports. The article is worth including in DYK, so I am happy to step in a help get it finished. The sources seem credible to me. Are there other issues left? PMCH2 (talk) 22:46, 26 September 2021 (UTC) Respectfully, not all of the issues raised in the above review have been addressed. Further, then sent to Cairo where she transferred from the SAAF to Great Britain's Women's Royal Air Force, receiving a commission contradicts the preceding paragraph that says she served ... in the South African Air Force (SAAF) from 23 October 1941 to 21 July 1945 and the fact that to have been a Second Lieutenant she must already have been a commissioned officer. Cavalryman (talk) 12:49, 27 September 2021 (UTC). I have added archive links for sources that don't have authors. I removed the one link that didn't work. Others have appropriate details. I have replied above to the concerns I have addressed. I removed the phrase about the commission. I have done my best to address all the issues. PMCH2 (talk) 03:26, 3 October 2021 (UTC) @PMCH2: when I get a chance I will have another detailed look. At a cursory glance, there is still plenty of room to add more bibliographic information to the citations, for instance the www.danishww2pilots.dk source should be: Plannthin, Mikkel (12 September 2010). "Inger Kristine Frith (née Pragholm)". Danish WW2 Pilots. Archived from the original on 31 August 2021. Retrieved 29 August 2021. I will look at the rest soon. Also, a QPQ still has not been provided. Cavalryman (talk) 21:59, 5 October 2021 (UTC). I haven't seen a DYK be scrutinized this closely before in regards to citations. I stepped in to try to help, but it's not my article, and I have spent as much time as I can. You seem to have a very high bar. I don't have a DYK credit to donate. 22:57, 7 October 2021 (UTC) I am sorry you think I am being overly harsh, but I think it is plain sloppy not including proper attribution, and the with the example above I think the fact that the same author is responsible for two cited sources is relevant. I initially reviewed the article because I thought the subject was interesting and worthy of some time in the main page sun. But I too have found it frustrating, I have conducted two complete reviews and even then my findings have not been acted upon, and further still there has been a stunningly consistent lack of attention to detail. I will now do some editing of the article to bring it up to a standard I believe is required. Cavalryman (talk) 01:28, 8 October 2021 (UTC). Thanks for your edits on the article. It reads better and I can see you have cleaned up the sources. I will do a QPQ this weekend, so we can get this over the line.PMCH2 (talk) 12:41, 10 October 2021 (UTC) Many thanks. If you cannot I will try to do one. I also intend to email World Archery to see if we can get a photo. Regards, Cavalryman (talk) 13:13, 10 October 2021 (UTC). I have reviewed Kennin Rebellion for DYK. Thanks for chasing down a photo - that would be great.PMCH2 (talk) 14:03, 12 October 2021 (UTC) Many thanks. Re photo I have been had correspondence with World Archery and they have said we can use the 1961 photo in this article, I am just trying to get them to confirm what license they are happy to release it under. Given I am now responsible for over 70% of the text [2], should a fresh reviewer have a look at this? Cavalryman (talk) 22:10, 12 October 2021 (UTC). After some initial positive correspondence World Archery not responded about licenses for almost a week. I will send one more email but am not holding my breath that a photo will be released. Cavalryman (talk) 22:29, 17 October 2021 (UTC). yeah, I think we're going to need a new reviewer on this one. Cavalryman, given your contributions to getting this article to DYK, I've added you to the credits section. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 20:04, 18 October 2021 (UTC) As best I can tell, the major issues concerning sourcing and attribution have been addressed, and this article seems ready for the main page. Thanks to everyone who contributed to make this work. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 04:54, 20 October 2021 (UTC) @Theleekycauldron: if a photo is released I will ping you to see if you are happy for it to be added to the nomination. Kind regards, Cavalryman (talk) 05:09, 20 October 2021 (UTC). Re photo ... the person I have been corresponding with at World Archery needs to return to the office to confirm their ownership status of this picture, due to covid that cannot occur before 4th November. I request this be held off until then. Cavalryman (talk) 09:50, 20 October 2021 (UTC). @Cavalryman: happy to wait. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 20:23, 21 October 2021 (UTC) Any updates on the image? If we waiting just for the image, I'll suggest to let this nomination run without an image. – Kavyansh.Singh (talk) 08:03, 30 October 2021 (UTC) As said above I do not expect any word before the 4th of November. If there is a chronic shortage of articles for DYK then by all means run this, but it would be a shame to potentially deny this most capable woman a face when she is featured for the sake of a week. Cavalryman (talk) 10:08, 31 October 2021 (UTC). There is no shortage of hooks on DYK. I was just concerned about how backlogged this particular nomination is. If it is worth waiting for the image, no issues then. – Kavyansh.Singh (talk) 10:19, 31 October 2021 (UTC) I have just received this in an email from World Archery: I checked last Thursday in our old history books, but there is no mention of photographer there. However, I'm on another track that was given to me by the author of another book on the history of our federation, but I'll have to check it out this Thursday when I'm again in the office. Things are in progress, and I should be able to give you some good news by next week! If everyone is happy to wait a few more days hopefully we’ll have a photo. Cavalryman (talk) 08:07, 8 November 2021 (UTC). @Cavalryman: Any updates? I think this should get promoted within a week if an image doesn't materialize. Side note to @BlueMoonset: original nom has been blocked for socking, do they still get a credit? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 05:13, 17 November 2021 (UTC) theleekycauldron, I'm trying to remember. Why don't you ask at WT:DYK and see whether there are any recollections about past cases, or strong opinions either way. Sorry I can't be more definitive. On the matter of promoting, the nomination will be three months old on December 2, and should have been promoted prior to then. BlueMoonset (talk) 05:30, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I see Wikipedia talk:Did you know/Archive 152#Multiple DYK nominations in process by newly checkuser-blocked sockpuppet: how to proceed?, which ended up with every nom made by the sock being rejected. Since this one's been adopted, We shouldn't close this nom, it's been adopted, but I am striking their credit. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 05:46, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Apologies, I was going to give an update this morning (Australian time). I had an email overnight from World Archery wanting to clarify the process of uploading a picture, I wouldn’t mind betting there will be an email with photo attached in the inbox at permissions@wikimedia.org tomorrow Swiss time. I agree, if there is no image within a week promote it, this has been a lengthy process. Cavalryman (talk) 06:03, 17 November 2021 (UTC).

Cerevisae (talk) 13:35, 17 October 2021 (UTC) @Narutolovehinata5: I have carried out some copyedits, let me know if there are areas that need another run-through. CMD (talk) 07:59, 24 October 2021 (UTC) Apologies for the late reply! Anyway, ALT0 is probably the best hook among the three proposed (ALT1 seems unimpressive to me while ALT2 may need additional context). However, the sentence verifying ALT0 doesn't have a footnote; instead, the references for it are spread across other nearby sentences instead, duplication is needed here for DYK purposes. In addition, it may be a good idea to propose an additional hook about Sarawak being the biggest timber exporter in the 1980s since that fact seems more interesting than the others discussed here. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 06:53, 1 November 2021 (UTC) added ALT 3. Cerevisae (talk) 04:30, 5 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you for the proposal; however, I feel that it may not meet WP:EGG. Would it be possible to rewrite ALT3 to make the link to "Economy of Sarawak" clearer? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 06:52, 5 November 2021 (UTC) talk, ALT 3 changed. Cerevisae (talk) 14:23, 8 November 2021 (UTC) ALT3 reads better, but it may still need to be copyedited for grammar. In addition it lacks a bold link to the DYK article subject. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:29, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Hook copyedited. CMD (talk) 07:03, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you for the edits. Now the article was new enough and long enough at the time of the nomination and no close paraphrasing was found. However, there are still a number of outstanding issues. Firstly, the sentence that mentions the main hook fact is lacking a footnote, with the relevant reference instead coming at the end of the paragraph where the fact is located at; duplication is necessary here per DYK rules. Secondly, the article doesn't say that the timber industry contributed "greatly" to Sarawak's economy: I would suggest deleting the word "greatly" from the hook, with the rest of that part being accepted as it's implied by the rest of the article. Thirdly, a QPQ has yet to be provided; this was the nominator's sixth nomination, so a QPQ should have been provided at the time of the nomination or within a week of then. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 05:49, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Ok, User:Narutolovehinata5, QPQ done. Cerevisae (talk) 08:11, 21 November 2021 (UTC) References ^ Chiou Sia, Tan (2015).

However, in the article the statement “they considered German lands too poor for annexation” is sourced to p.204 of Wells. pp.206-7 referred to above is used to support that they that “it was too costly in economic and military resources” to go into in Germany. I guess either way the hook is sourced but could you clarify the exact sourcing of the hook. Interesting: Y QPQ: None required. Overall: Interesting thorough article, well-written with good quality sourcing. Earwig shows no issues. Just a minor query around the hook sourcing but otherwise will be good to go. DeCausa (talk) 08:23, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @DeCausa: I found the web link that (for me) shows a preview if you're able to see it: https://books.google.com/books?id=mc30CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA206&lpg=PA206 SpartaN (talk) 10:07, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @SpartaN: Thanks for providing the link. It’s prompted a couple of thoughts for me. Firstly, Wells doesn’t seem to be saying the reason for the withdrawal is definitively known (“… the reasons for these decisions must have lain…”) i.e he’s making an assumption, however well founded. The hook is more definite than Wells is. Secondly, Wells’ emphasis is on the strength of the resistance being behind the reason - the poor value of the territory makes it “not worth it” because of the strength of the resistance. That’s not quite the same as just saying the land wasn’t valuable. (I notice the text you used in the article on this reflects that effort/value ratio issue.) To fix both points would you be prepared to consider an ALT1 which after “…Teutoburg” continues something along the lines of “…likely decided to leave Germany because the military effort was out of proportion to the territory’s value?” although there may need to be some trimming to get it into the 200 character limit. DeCausa (talk) 11:12, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @SpartaN and DeCausa: It's been over a month since the last comments here, have there been any updates? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:31, 13 November 2021 (UTC) From my point of view I’m waiting for SpartaN’s reply to my last post here. But I notice they haven’t edited Wikipedia since then, over a month ago. So I’m not quite sure what can be done. DeCausa (talk) 08:17, 13 November 2021 (UTC) I see. Given that there's really only one issue holding the nomination back, would anyone be willing to adopt this in case SpartaN doesn't return? It would be a shame if the nomination failed at this point. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 06:35, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I’m not sure what exactly are the DYK rules on this but, subject to that, options could be (a) I propose an ALT1 hook and someone else signs it off; (b) someone else proposes an ALT1 hook and I sign it off; (c) if anyone disagrees with me on the original hook I’m happy to step away and they sign it off. DeCausa (talk) 11:04, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I've looked at the Wells source and concur that it is saying the withdrawal was more down to the ratio of effort required to potential reward, and have boldly tweaked the copy in the article to reflect this. For what it's worth, I think ALT1 works just fine. firefly ( t · c ) 11:16, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Ok. I’m just going to formalize the ALT1 and let someone else add the tick and sign off: ALT1:... that the Romans won a series of campaigns against the Germanic tribes after the disaster at Teutoburg but likely decided to leave Germany as the effort was out of proportion to the territory’s value? DeCausa (talk) 12:07, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Since the reviewer has proposed a new hook, another editor will be needed to sign this off. I'm not sure though if the section linking in the bold links is allowed, however. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:29, 15 November 2021 (UTC) sorry, I missed that. It’s not even necessary to link to a section of the article so I’ve taken it out of ALT1.

It cites various sources, and Earwig's Copyvio detector shows 29.1% similarity (violation unlikely). But ... It has few neutrality issues including a neutrality tag. The hook seems fine, and maybe cited in the article. Can we have a source here? Rest, a QPQ has been done. Till the neutrality concerns are resolved, this DYK nomination should be on hold. – Kavyansh.Singh (talk) 06:57, 20 October 2021 (UTC) Kavyansh.Singh I rewrote the disputed section based on more reliable sources. Unfortunately, it was reverted immediately by ?Khirurg who appears to think that the New York Times is not a reliable source. Perhaps they would explain here why they object. (t · c) buidhe 03:05, 24 October 2021 (UTC) Yeah you rewrote it alright - by removing a whole bunch of sources. Maybe you can explain why AP is not reliable source? Perhaps you can also explain why you removed the POV tag, even though your edit did not address any of the issues raised in the talkpage? Khirurg (talk) 03:07, 24 October 2021 (UTC) Khirurg : Hi, I don't think the AP source supports the content it's cited for. The AP source reports that Greece has made certain accusations, it doesn't say whether they are correct or not. I'm not sure how Greek accusations against Turkey (regardless of whether they are correct or not) have any bearing about this article, which is about Greece. Cleanup tags should be removed unless there is active discussion ongoing and the person placing it can substantiate that there is a problem with the article. (t · c) buidhe 03:14, 24 October 2021 (UTC) Not only you removed AP news, you also removed the Brussels International Center. Your edits made the article even more POV, by trying to spin away the hostile actions of the Turkish government. And it's not a "cleanup tag", it's POV tag, and there is very much an active discussion going on, first of all right here. If you are avoiding the article talkpage and spin that "no discussion ongoing", that's not going to work. Khirurg (talk) 03:23, 24 October 2021 (UTC) Khirurg Actually I have no opinion on the reliability of BIC at this point, but I hesitate to cite think tanks when there are better sources available (I cited the New York Times, Verfassungsblog and an academic paper, all of which are higher quality than a think tank). I checked several sources and all of them mention that the main change in February-March 2020 was opening the border to migrants, some also mention that Turkey bussed migrants to the border or that at least one incident of coercing migrants was reported. Your wording suggests that all or many migrants since then were coerced to travel to Greece. This is misleading because few if any reliable sources support coercive "push" tactics being a widespread or systematic practice by Turkey at its border with Greece. (t · c) buidhe 04:02, 24 October 2021 (UTC) Not only is BIC itself a perfectly reliable source (much more so than the partisan NGOs you have filled the article with), but it's really not hard to find sources about the Turkish government coercing migrants to the border [3]. This assume of course that one in inclined to look for sources, instead of pretending they don't exist. And here [4] (and then doubled down [5], you seem to have followed me to a Requested Move I recently participated in, in what appears to be clear WP:HOUND behavior. So everyone can see what's going on here. Khirurg (talk) 00:47, 25 October 2021 (UTC) Okay, coming back to the DYK criteria, this seems to meet everything except the neutrality issues. I see that there has been no active discussion on the talk page form at-least 17 days. @Buidhe Any updates on @Khirurg's concerns? I can' formally approve this until the neutrality concerns are resolved. – Kavyansh.Singh (talk) 16:28, 25 October 2021 (UTC) @Kavyansh.Singh, Buidhe, and Khirurg: this nomination should probably be closed if the neutrality concerns are not resolved one way or another. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 01:21, 10 November 2021 (UTC) Great, now you can filibuster DYKs you don't like by raising spurious "concerns" and inserting loaded language. (t · c) buidhe 01:34, 10 November 2021 (UTC) What "loaded language"? I raised my concerns in the talkpage, and you've done nothing but edit-war since then. Khirurg (talk) 01:54, 10 November 2021 (UTC) The most egregiously loaded language I recall was a human rights violation that encapsulates a will to eliminate a person’s presence on the face of the planet, which was added by you. Khirurg (talk) 02:02, 10 November 2021 (UTC) You insist on inserting loaded language like "Weaponization of migration" and "coercive engineered migration" which simply do not reflect the majority reliable sources (and are only tangentially related to the article topic, because they are accusations against Turkey rather than Greece) as explained above. I explained that you have misrepresented sources as seen above, and substituted opinion pieces for news coverage and peer-reviewed academic papers, and all you do is revert. So it's unclear to me how any progress can be made here. (t · c) buidhe 02:07, 10 November 2021 (UTC) Everything I have added is sourced to reliable sources. As far as opinion pieces, you're the one that has added those, such as this opinion piece written by grad students [6]. You haven't made the slightest effort to meet me halfway, instead you just blanket-revert all my additions claiming "my sources are better than yours". No attempt at dispute resolution, just blanket reverts like this [7]. The article is mainly based on activist NGO sources. Yes, there can be no progress under these conditions. Khirurg (talk) 02:45, 10 November 2021 (UTC) You literally replaced a news article from the New York Times and academic paper with an opinion piece from The Hill regarding the March 2020 escalation in order to replace fact-based description with loaded language of "weaponization". I did not cite any opinion pieces in the article, and it's a lie to say that the article is "mainly based on activist NGO sources". (t · c) buidhe 03:37, 10 November 2021 (UTC) (Personal attack removed). I just linked to an opinion piece you put in the article in my previous post. InfoMigrants, Mare Liberum, Aegean Boat Report are all activist NGOs used as references (to name just a few). The only way to resolve this is through some form of third party mediation. Would you be agreeable to something like that, yes or no? Khirurg (talk) 04:01, 10 November 2021 (UTC) That's simply untrue, InfoMigrants is a journalism outfit based on a media partnership, not a NGO let alone an "activist" one, and the EJIL Talk piece is expert analysis, not from their editorial section. As for third party mediation, sure why not? But I can't see the use in repeating points that were ignored the first time. (t · c) buidhe 12:11, 10 November 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: imho, the best way to break a filibuster is the old fashioned way: cloture motion. I'd recommend that you get as many eyes on this as possible, see if a clearer consensus falls out. my confidence in either of you conceding your point is dwindling, so this back-and-forth seems unhelpful, as you both pointed out. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 08:52, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Articles created/expanded on October 9[edit] Pankratius Pfeiffer ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that Salvatorian priest Pankratius Pfeiffer saved hundreds of Jews in Rome during the Second World War? Reviewed: 1936 Northeast Flood Created by Ergo Sum (talk). Self-nominated at 17:52, 9 October 2021 (UTC). New article that was created on 9 October 2021? is 3,212 characters and nominated on the same day. No copyvios detected and duplication detector of [8][9][10][11][12] reveal no close paraphrasing issues (AGF PDF docs which can't go through Dup detector). Article is well-sourced. Hook is 103 characters long (under 200 character max.) and is interesting. Refs 4 and 5 (verifying the hook) are reliable sources. QPQ done. Looks good to go! —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:41, 9 October 2021 (UTC) Too many red flags here. If he really saved hundreds of Jews, you would expect plenty of confirmation of this in scholarly sources and him to be recognized by Yad Vashem. I can't count the number of times that I've seen mainstream newspapers print completely false stories about Jews being rescued during the holocaust, so better sources are definitely needed to confirm these extraordinary claims. Thanks Brigade Piron for letting me know about this. (t · c) buidhe 16:51, 10 October 2021 (UTC) I have to admit I'm just a bit perplexed by the argument. Except in fairly uncommon cases of multiple RS that contradict each other, we don't generally recognize any "hierarchy" of reliable sources. Sources are either RS or they are not. So I'm not sure what kind of sources you have in mind as "better" sources. The ones currently cited in the article are all RS, so that should be the end of it. I might add that if you seek some manner of official imprimatur in the vein of Yad Vashem, the City of Rome named a street after him. Your point about why there isn't more extensive coverage of this historical figure is well taken but can easily be attributed to the fact that all manner of historical figures are lost to history, especially those who are notable really for one major event in their life that did not come to light until years later, as is the case here. Indeed, one of the RS in this article describes Pfeiffer as being "lost to history." I'm adding the new review icon here so that we can get at least one more editor's evaluation of this. Ergo Sum 13:32, 16 October 2021 (UTC) There are very few people who actually saved hundreds of Jews during the Holocaust and plenty of hoaxes that were reported as truth by various news organizations—for example Necdet Kent. In other cases, actual rescue did occur but the numbers are greatly exaggerated and repeated uncritically by news organizations, such as Raoul Wallenberg. If the story is true you would expect to see it covered in many more credible sources. There are plenty of cases where a source is reliable for some info but not others. For example, someone's CV is often reliable for "they worked at X organization" but not "they are a world expert in Z". Extraordinary claims require extraordinary sourcing. (t · c) buidhe 21:27, 16 October 2021 (UTC) I should say that I share Buidhe's concerns. I think saying that "all manner of historical figures are lost to history" rather side-steps the sheer volume of historical scholarship on all aspects of the Holocaust. On a more banal note, I think part of the problem is that the sources cited are, essentially, all journalistic sources published by explicitly Catholic or Salvatorian outlets. The specific sources cited for the "saved" claim are Romereports (I am not familiar with this outlet, but the typo in the video does not inspire confidence) and a self-published Salvatorian newsletter. Neither are scholarly sources and both are, again, explicitly confessional in nature. I think WP:BIASED may on point in a highly sensitive issue touching on the wider disputes about Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust. Do we know what the Samerski book says, for example? —Brigade Piron (talk) 08:55, 17 October 2021 (UTC) Buidhe It is true that the sources cover Catholic issues, but only the Salvatorian one is actually published by a Catholic institution. I need not go into how varied Catholic newspapers are in their adherence/faithfulness to the Catholic hierarchy and beliefs (see e.g. National Catholic Reporter versus National Catholic Register). But more direclty, there actually are many scholarly RS that discussion Pfeiffer and his works in Nazi-occupied Rome. You will find them on the other language versions of this article. The problem is that I do not read Italian or German well enough to use them in the article. Coverage is not the issue. It is English language coverage. Ergo Sum 13:48, 17 October 2021 (UTC) @Ergo Sum: perhaps add the word "reportedly" before "saved". I'm inclined to accept in good faith the sources used as reliable – none of them have not been deprecated nor deemed generally unreliable. —Bloom6132 (talk) 16:41, 26 October 2021 (UTC) DYK should not cover unconfirmed reports or rumors so I strongly disagree with that suggestion. As well as assuming sources are reliable if they've never been discussed at WP:RSN, which disregards important parts of WP:RS such as WP:CONTEXTMATTERS. There is no issue with citing sources in Italian or German, but if it's not confirmed that they support the content then it's incorrect to assume that they do. (t · c) buidhe 20:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Bloom6132: I tend to think that statements are either supported by RS and written in wikivoice or they're not accepted at all. For that reason, I shy away from words like "reportedly." I reiterate though that I think it's quite clear there's nothing wrong with the sources currently used. They're all RS, so that should be the end of it. Hence, why I think your initial review was satisfactory. Ergo Sum 23:40, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Ergo Sum: agreed. I'm still of the view that the hook satisfies criteria 3b. Criteria 4 states that "Nominations should be rejected if an inspection reveals that they are not based on reliable sources". That is not the case here. —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) You're still ignoring the principle in RS that context matters, and some sources are reliable for some but not other info. The two of us who actually write on Holocaust related topics have expressed that the sources cited are not reliable for the exceptional claims being made.

By that logic, I should be able to veto baseball or heraldry hooks ... —Bloom6132 (talk) 01:10, 27 October 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: Three of my DYKs promoted (including Coat of arms of the Falkland Islands from August this year) have included the word "reportedly" in the hook, as well as numerous hooks from other editors. Disagree all you want – this is accepted practice at DYK. —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: I'm aware that you have experience writing about Holocaust-related articles and I put value in your assessment as a solid editor. However, I'm quite comfortable in my ability to vet RS, as well, and my confidence in these sources means I must disagree with your opinion here. Experienced editors do disagree at times, and it is my opinion that I think you have gotten this one wrong; doubtless, you think the same for me. I haven't seen any evidence that these are not RS. Therefore, I recommend if Bloom6132 is inclined to do so, to renew their approval of the hook. In the meantime, I'm going to request the input of additional experienced editors on the DYK talk page. Ergo Sum 01:28, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm going to ping @Bamse, Bermicourt, Jmabel, and Anyfile to see if we can find some reliable sources in other languages. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 01:46, 27 October 2021 (UTC) Oops, @AnyFile theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 01:47, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm currently traveling & very busy, so not much help here, I'm afraid. - Jmabel | Talk 01:53, 27 October 2021 (UTC) That said, more or less this same case is made in The Pope's Jews: The Vatican's Secret Plan to Save Jews from the Nazis by Gordon Thomas (not currently cited in the article). - Jmabel | Talk 02:00, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm unclear as to why the cited sources are unreliable: are we assuming that all information emanating from a Roman Catholic source is unreliable? If so what's the logic? In any case there are dozens of book sources in English, German, French and Italian that mention Pfeiffer, the problem is that few are accessible online. One is an entire biography of Pfeiffer "from baker to Vatican diplomat" which would be useful to track down: Willer, Philomena (2005). P. Pankratius Pfeiffer SDS: (1872-1945); vom Bäckergesellen zum Vatikandiplomat. Pub: Josef Fink. Others that mentions Pfeiffer and the Jews in Rome are: Liebhart (1996) Schwangau. Meding (1992), Flucht vor Nürnberg. Sinn (1976), Illegal. Bermicourt (talk) 08:41, 27 October 2021 (UTC) My issue is with the unreliability of journalistic works and popular history, which have in many cases published inaccurate information about rescues of Jews during the Holocaust. If better sources exist, they should be cited instead. An additional question is, do these sources actually support the claim of "hundreds" of Jews rescued by Pfeiffer personally? (t · c) buidhe 08:51, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I've now found sources that cover most of the article. Here are more: Liebhart (1996) Schwangau. Meding (1992), Flucht vor Nürnberg. Sinn (1976), Illegal. Prince Constantine of Bavaria (1952) Der Papst. Layer (1985), Schwäbisches Ehrenbuch - Pfeiffer credited with "saving Rome and other Italian cities including Chieti, Ascoli and Ovieto from destruction and other calamities" _ (1999). Publik-Forum - Pfeiffer the only German to have a street named after him in Rome and who fought to save Roman Jews. _ (1960). Bayerische Frömmigkeit - Pfeiffer described as the "Saviour of Rome and other cities in Italy" Robert Katz has written a number of books - Death in Rome (1967), Black Sabbath (1969), The Battle for Rome (2010) - which all mention Pfeiffer. Bottum and Dalin (2004). The Pius War has this interesting piece: "7. Pancrazio [sic] Pfeiffer. According to Carroll-Abbing, one of the men used by Pius XII to protest the Nazi roundup of Rome's Jews and intervene for persecuted victims was Father Pancrazio Pfeiffer, superior general of the Salvatorian Fathers, who also served as Pius XII' personal liaison to the German military command in Rome. Because Pfeiffer died tragically in an automobile accident toward the end of the war and thus never took part in the postwar analysis of Pius XII's conduct, many historians have overlooked him. But those who knew him or have researched his life have chronicled his collaborative efforts with Pius XII to rescue Jews and others during the war. See the article "Pfeiffer's List" by Robert Graham, 30 Days, June 1994, pp. 42-46. Prince Constantine of Bavaria's book on Pius XII, The Pope (London: Allan Wingate, 1954) [listed above] contains an excellent section on Pfeiffer, whom he describes as an agent for the pope on behalf of the victims of persecution and the fugitives in hiding" (p. 213). At Pfeiffer's death in May 1945, Vatican Radio paid tribute: "He came into contact with the Commander of the German occupying forces [in Rome in 1943-44]. From that day onwards, he placed his religious and spiritual qualities at the service of many who had been arrested or already condemned to death. He helped countless people in this way, and saved their lives, among them many Jews and other Italian personages. He championed..." In short there seems to be book evidence for virtually everything stated in the article apart from the specific details of the two incidents where 249 or 400 Jews were rescued. Based on my initial searches my expectation is that those incidents are likely to be recorded in the literature - we just need to be able to access more of the sources. Meanwhile there is no harm in pausing to use some of the above sources, plus those I've added to the Further reading section of the article in order to reinforce the existing references and then review where we are.

For example, Salvatorians USA Province is not independent of the article subject and therefore is not reliable for self-serving assertions such as "he saved many Jews in Rome from persecution and ultimately death" or "Every day, Pfeiffer visited the Regina Coeli prison and another prison on Via Tasso, where he would often return with freed prisoners who had been sentenced to death." (t · c) buidhe 08:27, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: would you still object if the article instead relied on the sources found by Bermicourt? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 04:58, 5 November 2021 (UTC) Depends, the Samerski source looks reliable to me but the book published by "Österreichische Provinz der Salvatorianer" has the same issue of close connection to the article subject. (t · c) buidhe 06:27, 5 November 2021 (UTC) All right. @Ergo Sum: I'm not going to promote the nomination without consensus to move forward, so if you want to try and rework the article's sourcing to approval, that can work.

Ergo Sum 15:45, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I have added several inline citations to the article, which refer to sources that were (very helpfully) added by Bermicourt. These sources support several of the very specific claims in the article, as well as the general thrust of the article which is in dispute here, namely that Pfeiffer was a liaison and in that capacity saved many Jews and others from the Nazis. In light of these reliable sources supporting the general claims, I think any concern about the pre-existing ones describing some of his more specific actions is ameliorated. There is a trove of additional sources in the Further Reading section that additionally describe in much greater detail Pfeiffer's actions but they are either in a foreign language which I do not adequately read to make use of as citations or are offline. All being said, I think there is now ample sourcing to back up the article's claims. Ergo Sum 05:49, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks, Ergo Sum—@Buidhe:, if this sourcing is up to your standards, we can move ahead. If not, we're probably going back to WT:DYK and asking for more eyes. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 05:52, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Hi, I've flagged the specific content in the article that supports the hook as needing a better source. There are other active cleanup tags on the article as well. However, I think there's sufficient sourcing for a modified version of the hook without the words "hundreds of".

Bermicourt (talk) 08:33, 17 November 2021 (UTC) According to the source it's what Vatican Radio said about him after his death. DYK is not for eulogies imo. (t · c) buidhe 08:37, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I'm not following—is the source unreliable because it's after his death? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 08:40, 17 November 2021 (UTC) No, it's because it's Catholic presumably... We could always add "according to Vatican Radio..." But better still, we just need to cite the exact text from one of the many non-Catholic book sources and the problem will be solved. Bermicourt (talk) 08:46, 17 November 2021 (UTC) And yet another source: O'Reilly (2001) in Forgotten Battles: Italy's War of Liberation 1943-45 states that "the Vatican was able to assist many of Rome's Jews and others sought by the Germans through Father Pancrazio Pfeiffer's intervention with the Germans... His work was recounted by Robert Graham who has written extensively on the Vatican's role in World War II." Bermicourt (talk) 09:01, 17 November 2021 (UTC) And another: Bartley (2016) in Catholics Confronting Hitler states that "Father Pancrace [sic] Pfeiffer, a German priest and the superior general of the Salvatorian Order, was the pope's liaison with the German military. Several hundred hostages, including some under sentence of death, owed their release to the efficacious intervention of Father Pfeiffer." I don't know why I'm doing this - you can look up the references yourselves instead of opining and speculating from the sidelines in the classic Wikipedia way. :) Bermicourt (talk) 09:08, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @Bermicourt: Since it seems you have access to several sources that I do not (probably just requires further digging), would you want to add them as inline citations with page numbers, especially to support the proposition regarding hundreds of people saved?

I'd be in favor instead of the hook being split into two separate proposals: one hook about the fact that she was an internet celebrity who grew up in a place without tap water, and a separate hook about her going viral for making hamburgers. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:23, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Full review needed, which can also address the issue of the borderline ALT1 hook. BlueMoonset (talk) 04:23, 5 November 2021 (UTC) As far as I can tell the article meets DYK requirements, and a QPQ has been done. Earwigs finds a close match with Coda Media, but that's only because it was the source for quotes in the article, and all of them are properly referenced. I find the first hook hard to believe given China's international standing, and in any case as brought up by Bowlhover may be inaccurate anyway. As for the second hook, as I mentioned before it's ineligible as it's exactly 200 characters long, and per WP:DYK hooks that are at or shorter than 200 characters may be rejected per reviewer's discretion. Both ALT0 and ALT1 have struck: I am repeating my earlier suggestion that ALT1 instead be split into two separate hooks. As this is a China-related article and there appear to be some political discussion in the article, I'd also like to ask for a second opinion from someone more knowledgeable about China-related articles if the article doesn't fall afoul of relevant guidelines. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 13:12, 6 November 2021 (UTC) From Wikipedia:Did you know#The hook: The hook should be concise: no more than about 200 characters (including spaces and the question mark, but not including the ..., the space immediately following the ..., or any (pictured)). While 200 is a hard limit, hooks near or at this limit may still be rejected at the discretion of reviewers and administrators. This tool can be used for counting words. The guideline says that "200 is a hard limit", so it is not true that the 200-character ALT1 hook is "ineligible" or "simply too long". No reason has been given for rejecting a 200-character hook "at the discretion of reviewers". Here are two additional hooks based on the suggestion: ALT2: ... that Dianxi Xiaoge, who grew up in a remote Yunnan mountain without running water, is an Internet celebrity with roughly 16 million subscribers on all her platforms? ALT3: ... Dianxi Xiaoge went viral in China and internationally after making hamburgers for her grandparents who had never eaten them before? Cunard (talk) 07:48, 7 November 2021 (UTC) Well for one thing, the original was very difficult to read and seemed to combine too many facts into one hook. Usually DYK prefers simpler hooks whenever possible. In any case, I think ALT3 is the best hook here and the nomination is otherwise good to go, I'd just like to hear a second opinion from another editor on the article tone given that I'm a bit uncomfortable doing a solo review here given the "Commentary" section delves into some political matters. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:36, 7 November 2021 (UTC) On second thought, I have some concerns regarding the length of the article. Isn't it rather detailed for an internet celebrity's page? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 11:10, 7 November 2021 (UTC) That the article is "rather detailed for an internet celebrity's page" should not be a concern. The sources provided substantial analysis of her and her work, and this article reflects those sources. Other detailed articles for Internet celebrities include PewDiePie and MrBeast.

Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:57, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I don't think we need Gatoclass to restate themself. Here's what they said at WT:DYK: The article doesn't use the phrase "one of only three Chinese influencers to gain international influence", so I'm not sure where you got that, but it does say she is one of only three "Chinese Internet celebrities who have reached international prominence", and the problem with that claim is that it's sourced to an article that is two years old and therefore not up-to-date. With regard to the overall length, I would agree that it is overly detailed and could use a trim. I'm not sure this is relevant to DYK however, as "overly detailed" is not one of our criteria. What I would say is that the level of detail does raise the chances of close paraphrasing so the article would need to be carefully checked for that. Anybody else with an opinion on this article?

My reasoning here is that if the hook were read as plaintext, without any bolding or linking, it would be read as pretty much only interesting as it concerns the plot. The hook should concern Smit's life; if it concerns her work as an actress, only stating her role and not anything about production doesn't make the hook out-of-universe. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 21:28, 17 November 2021 (UTC) theleekycauldron, I was taking a look at the ALT1 hook and its sources, and the second Biography sentence is basically copied from Esquire—the Google translate version, at any rate. That's a problem. Another problem is that the source doesn't actually say that she was working as a hotel receptionist when she got the call, just that it was "one of these jobs", referring back to the four in the previous sentence, none of which were hotel receptionist. The article also needs a bit of copyediting. I don't think that either of the plot-based hooks should be used, and as Drmies notes, "first film" is not accurate, since it's Cross the Line that's in the source, which appears to be her fifth film. We could only use "first feature film" if the previous four in her filmography were all short films (which would need to be clearly sourced). Perhaps an angle for the information in ALT1 would be to say she was working in whatever job it was when she was cast in Cross the Line, for which she was nominated as best new actress in the Goya Awards. BlueMoonset (talk) 02:31, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Here’s an article that states she was working as a receptionist two years before she was hired to work on Parallel Mothers:[13] Does it appear reliable?

However, it isn't sufficient to support the "when she was called" hook claim, just that she was a hotel receptionist two years before the article was written (and possibly two years and a number of months, since you can't assume it's exactly two years).

Comment (not a review): I started looking at this, but realised I am very much not familiar with this area and don't feel entirely confident undertaking a review. I do like the hooks and it's an intriguing subject for an article! I wanted to flag the following comments, in case they are helpful (please ignore if not!): I don't quite follow this sentence in the lead: "Moreover, it is still pointed out that the emendation Albruna agrees with the names of other Germanic wise women." Should "instriptions" (before the Drusus heading) be "inscriptions"? Should the names of scholars be wikilinked, where there is a page for the author (e.g. Simek)? What does mss mean, and could this be explained when it is first referenced? The second paragraph of the Aurinia section has two sentences starting with "However" in a row, which is a bit awkward to read.

Meets newness and length requirements easily, QPQ done. Earwig brings up the two most-cited sources as potential copyvios. To be expected, since they're cited almost 20 times each, and since the vast majority of the matches concern long quotes I'm willing to overlook it, but can we add more citations throughout the paragraphs? Particularly with "Conflict with Miles and Reynolds", there's four citations crammed at the end of the section. I think we should cite each after the corresponding sentences, especially where there's a direct quotation. Also for ALT0 we need a citation at the ends of the sentences for "Golden Boy" and "Whiz Kid". Otherwise nice read, and good use of sources.

Its long enough and new and lots of good refs - including the hook fact. It documents a notable woman from the 14th century and there were not many of those. There is no image, its well written and I offer an alternative phrasing of the hook, but its up to someone else to decide if its ok. No evidence of close paraphrasing I could see. Nice addition. well done Victuallers (talk) 10:31, 6 November 2021 (UTC) Reopening this because I think the hook is misleading, as according to the source it was usual for women of the nobility, like Neville, to sign with their own names. Gatoclass (talk) 02:10, 19 November 2021 (UTC) @Gatoclass: I don't think most will know that, so maybe we go with ALT1 or some variation on it? We don't need to say it's unusual if we phrase it that way theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 02:14, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Theleekycauldron, the problem with both hooks is that they imply that there was something out-of-the-ordinary in a woman signing something in her own name in that era, whereas the source indicates that was normal practice for women of the nobility. So the hooks are misleading. Gatoclass (talk) 02:19, 19 November 2021 (UTC) All right—I'll ping @Lajmmoore and Victuallers: back here, y'all can work this out. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 02:33, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Was it usual for women in the fourteenth century to sign with their own name ... no. Is is usual for women in the 21st century to sign with just their first name? No. So "did you know that unusually Canada's head of state signs documents with just her first name and an R for Regina?" (Someone shouts) "BUT all British Queens do that!!" (Someone shouts) "That implies that it was unusual for Queens to sign with just their first name." No it doesnt. I think @Gatoclass: is reading the source and then saying that the hook doesnt explain every piece of information in the source... which obviously it doesnt. Its unusual that "a woman" is doing this at all. It WAS unusual for women in the fourteenth century to sign and if they did then they did not usually use just their own name. Its a fact - its unusual. Did You know that women did not sign their own names on documents in the 14th century? No I didnt. That is something that Lajmmoore wrote about and now I know. Thanks. Victuallers (talk) 08:28, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Hello Gatoclass all so the part of the source I was using is this, which is talking about signatures for charitable donation "Although most of the widows declare themselves to be the wife of their late husband, or their father's daughter, others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names, such as 'domina Margareta de Longvl' and 'don-ýina Margareta de Nevill' (the same person). The majority of widows declare that their marital status and their power to act, using a variety of phrases, including 'in pura viduitate', 'in pura viduitate mea et ligia potestate', and 'in viduitate mea propria et potestate legitima' ..." and I read that as it was more usual for (noble) women to use a signature that described them as "wife of, etc..." I read the passage as Legg using Margaret de Neville as an unusual example. Legg is talking about the Coucher Book signatures specifically, but I still think they are marking out unusual practice. In terms of the hook, I wonder whether changing 'woman' to 'literate woman' might work? Lajmmoore (talk) 09:32, 19 November 2021 (UTC) No, it wouldn't work just to add "literate". And your reading of the text just amounts to an unsupported assumption on your part. Because while the text could admittedly be less ambiguous, the statement that others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names does not in any way suggest that it was rare or unusual for a member of the nobility to give their name, it only states that members of the nobility as a class were inclined to give their names. So there isn't sufficient support in that statement for a hook which implies that Neville's act was in any way unusual for a member of her class. The hook makes Neville sound like some sort of proto-feminist who boldly challenged the system, when the underlying source only indicates that either her entire class did the same thing, or at least that it was an accepted practice for members of the nobility. So I still think that either the hook needs to be substantially reworked to more closely reflect the source, or a new hook be found. Gatoclass (talk) 02:53, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks for sharing your interpretation of your text Gatoclass. My interpretation (& so the hook) is based on Legg's use of the word most - in that "most of the widows declare themselves to be the wife of their late husband, or their father's daughter" and you rightly point out "others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names" but I think that needs to be balanced by the "most" earlier in the sentence i.e. for women generally, they don't give their name, but some noble women do but overall, for women signing their name, it is unusual enough to be pointed out in the text.

Whispyhistory (talk) 06:32, 13 November 2021 (UTC) I don't see that exact sequence of numbers in the source, although there are others that look a bit like an IP address. The trouble is, the nominator seems to be the source for it looking a bit like an IP address, which it does, but we can't use that unless the source makes a similar point, which it does not appear to do. Something like this might work (numbers might need to be changed as mentioned): ALT1 ... that a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone may be described as 88.5.3.2? Philafrenzy (talk) 10:16, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Regarding the image, it's a fun idea but I don't think we run images as quizzes and the image is simply a skeletal foot, and not closely enough related to the hook.

I don't see how the hook you're suggesting is hooky. What exactly is wrong with the hook proposed? It's in the article and it's supported by the sources cited. And the image is directly related to the hook. It engages the reader into a spotting game. Dr. Vogel (talk) 14:57, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Like everyone else, I rather like the IP-address hook. If we wikilinked IP address, it would be supported in the linked articles, and fulfill the requirement that anyone following the links will be able to verify the hook. I don't think we need sourcing that says that a specific sequence of numbers is an IP address, as we have sources giving the general format of an IP address, and creating an example would be a trivial calculation ("Are all four of these numbers separated by periods in the range 0-255?"): "IPv4 and IPv6 address formats". www.ibm.com. An IPv4 address has the following format: x . x . x . x where x is called an octet and must be a decimal value between 0 and 255. Octets are separated by periods. An IPv4 address must contain three periods and four octets. The following examples are valid IPv4 addresses: 1 . 2 . 3 . 4 01 . 102 . 103 . 104 This hook is better than any alternative I can think of, and I don't see anything likely to be problematic about it (it's certainly verifiable). I think we might be in agreement on that? So if some rule technically prohibits it, we might have a good case for applying the WP:Ignore all the rules policy. Broken finger is also currently DYK-eligible and I think it uses the same numbering scheme.[1] HLHJ (talk) 02:07, 14 November 2021 (UTC) [edit: add fulltext url] I don't necessarily agree with the reading of WP:DYKCRIT 3b ( Each fact in the hook must be supported in the article by at least one inline citation to a reliable source [...]) that says that the IP thing needs to be in the article (compare e.g. Template:Did you know nominations/Urine deflector, which similarly took some creative licence in how the proposed hooks were phrased beyond what was stated in either the article or the cited source), and I agree with HLHJ that WP:IAR would be applicable regardless. As for the hooks themselves, writing "a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone may be described as 88.5.3.2" is a much poorer way of writing the hook (less "hooky") than the converse, i.e. "88.5.3.2 may refer to a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone". TompaDompa (talk) 11:28, 14 November 2021 (UTC) This. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 17:01, 16 November 2021 (UTC) We can't use IP address because the nominator just thought it up "oh, that looks like an IP address". It's not in the source as the nominator admits and therefore is not verifiable. And so what if it does look like an IP address? What does that tell us about broken toes? I like clever or quirky hooks and have written many (if I may say so), but they have to be based on something in the sources otherwise it's things made up one day. Philafrenzy (talk) 10:19, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you for all your comments. This is not the place to ignore all rules. The proposed hook is not supported by the source given in the article. I am inclined to approve ALT1 but it needs checking, unless another hook is proposed. Whispyhistory (talk) 15:11, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Oh dear, this has become contentious. I think the contended question is whether it's acceptable to have verified information not found in the nominated article, but only in another article, linked in the hook. Not as hooky, but for illustration: ALT3 ... that the dot-decimal notation string "88.5.3.2" is not only an an IPv4 address, but also a fracture in the middle of the bone at the tip of the little toe? "IPv4 and IPv6 address formats". www.ibm.com., Hallux proximal phalanx fracture in adults: an overlooked diagnosis I don't think we're debating whether the IP-address-hook statement is verifiable. The statement that "88.5.3.2" (and any number in that format) is a valid IPv4 address is supported by the IP address article and the IPv4 article, and this format is the subject of the Dot-decimal notation article. No-one had bothered to cite those statements in those articles, but since they've been challenged here, I've now cited them. So "88.5.3.2 is both an IP address[1] and a code for a broken toebone[2]" is certainly verifiable, and is now verified on Wikipedia. Any DYK reader should have no trouble verifying that the hook is accurate. Alternatives that do not mention IP addressees are not as hooky, but don't contain more information about broken toes: ALT4 ... that "88.5.3.2" is a toe fracture in the middle of the bone at the tip of the little toe, while a "78.5.3.2" is the parallel broken finger?

Philafrenzy (talk) 19:25, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you Philafrenzy ( a very experienced DYK contributor) for your efforts in helping new editors understand DYK. Your comment higher up about "88.5.3.2" and "ip address" not being in the source is true and I am grateful for your suggested alts. Essentially, the initial and subsequent hooks sound good, but none are in the article or the source. I don't wish for personal comments and don't mind if someone else wishes to take over here. With due respect @DrVogel: and @HLHJ:...You may wish to take this up at Wikipedia talk:Did you know. Whispyhistory (talk) 10:41, 15 November 2021 (UTC) I won't say I wish I hadn't written the article; I hope it's useful enough to make up for the social harm to the project here. I don't think the hostility was intended by anyone; I suspect that it's felt partly due to the ease of mininterpretation in a text-only medium and partly due to human cognitive biases.[2] I certainly did, and do, not intend it. I spent a day's editing trying to resolve the conflict by finding references specifically saying that the two things were in notation X and adding that text to the article, but unfortunately non-inductive descriptions of the notations seem to have been considered so needless that an Internet RFC attempting to formalize them died of disinterest. I did find a source that explicitly defines the IPv4 format, and one that explicitly says that 88.1.2.2 is a specific fracture, and I've cited the latter in the article, but I don't think this helps. It is probably a bit unreasonable to expect a reviewer to do more than apply rules as best they can, and Wikipedia talk:Did you know might indeed be a better forum for a more detailed discussion. I don't really want to take part in one, though (nothing to do with this discussion, prior reasons). I posted because I felt responsible for the conflict and thought I might be able to help. My impression is that I made it worse; my apologies to everyone I've offended. HLHJ (talk) 03:41, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Nobody is offended, but if I may say so I think you are still missing the point. IP addresses have nothing to do with broken toes even if that notation may have a similarity. That's why the sources don't make the comparison and why the IP-based hooks are no good. Any of the other hooks might be fine (I haven't checked the numbers) just without the bit about IP addresses. The whole thing reminds me of unusually shaped vegetables where you may see a carrot shaped like a foot, people who see faces in clouds, and even apophenia. My personal observation that one thing looks a bit like another is not the basis for a hook unless reliable sources make the point too. Philafrenzy (talk) 09:09, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Folks, we are wasting a wonderful hook. Really. IP addresses have nothing to do with broken toes even if that notation may have a similarity and that is the whole point of making good hooks. They are supposed to be short, punchy, catchy, and likely to draw the readers in to wanting to read the article – as long as they don't misstate the article content. And one of the best recipes to make a hook good is to make it sound counterintuitive With any other option but the original, we are bound to receive another hook frequented by maybe a few hundred visitors. I would propose something to the tune of in some contexts, 88.5.3.2 might not mean an IP address but a broken bone in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone? so that no one claims here that we somehow delegitimise the IP address but at the same time so that we preserve the core of the hook. As for the claims that because the hook is not cited in the IP part, it can't be there - please don't be that pedantic. In our today's world of informatics we may assume that people who visit Wikipedia more or less imagine what IP addresses are, and may more or less imagine how they look like (in the worst case they will visit the article for details). The other part is cited. I see no problem with the original. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 17:01, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Szmenderowiecki I admit that I'm not very familiar with the topic, and the above discussion was confusing, but is the "this isn't an IP address" claim actually in the source? Because if it's not, then no matter how good the hook proposal is, it can't be used in a hook since hook facts need to be based on a reference. Also, I'm pretty sure that assumptions don't count as sources. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:31, 17 November 2021 (UTC) What I was leading is that we don't need to cite that the sky is blue, or that we have five fingers; or that there exist IP addresses for that matter. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 11:08, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Given that these IP number hooks aren't working out so far, I wonder if some other hooks unrelated to that could be proposed here. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 02:11, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Comment only If we accept the first hook we will end up with thousands of hits, some quiet smiles and some who will continue to believe that DYK broke the rules. We're allowed to. This is not a massive occasion where we can save the whole project by breaking the rules. Its a trivial example of what some (not all) think may be a breach in the rules, with a small, but amusing, advantage. So I'm not asking the defenders of the rules to admit that this is not a breech ... I am suggesting that they might just concede that the harm done by allowing this hook might not offend anyone ... and it might please a few thousand. Victuallers (talk) 15:28, 20 November 2021 (UTC) We don't need to break the rules. The observation that the notation looks a bit like an IP address is trivial and completely unrelated to broken toes. There are already perfectly good hooks above that work better. Nobody is saying don't use the numbers, just strike the bit about IP addresses. The originally proposed hook is not the work of comic genius and cleverness that some seem to think it is. Philafrenzy (talk) 21:58, 20 November 2021 (UTC) The main issue here is that it's one of the core rules of DYK that hook facts must be mentioned in the article, ideally explicitly or at least implied by supporting information. The thing is that at the moment, IP addresses are not mentioned anywhere in the article, so the hooks using the IP address angle would be ineligible according to that criterion anyway. Even April Fools hooks, which tend to be misleading, are still generally based on hook facts that are mentioned in the respective articles. So if we can't even grant IAR exemptions for that criterion for AFD hooks, the one day of the year where our hooks tend to follow the rules most loosely, I can't see why such a request should be granted here.

Nominated by Victuallers (talk) at 16:21, 6 November 2021 (UTC). Article is new enough. Two correct writers are credited. The article is fully referenced. No copyvio detected. There is a bit of biased POV pushing in Wikipedia voice: "most vulnerable to climate change". This will be something our subject is saying no doubt. And this idea is also reflected in the hook with "endangered". The hook content is referenced and confirmed by the Guardian, apart from the "endangered" bit, which opinion is attributed to Tina Stege. So I suggest that "endangered" is taken out of the hook, or it is reworded so it is clear she is saying that. Hook alt1 is unsuitable as it does not link the article and I cannot tell what it is trying to say in relation to the subject. I can confirm image is CC-BY-3.0 as derived from the video with CC-BY-3.0 license. However I would suggest that a different image is selected from the video, perhaps near the end where the microphone is not obscuring her chin. QPQ is done.

Self-nominated at 23:51, 4 November 2021 (UTC). @DferDaisy: This article is about 3300 bytes, and was nominated for DYK shortly after creation, satisfying date and length criteria. There is a factual error, as the article states she was interred in Keokuk, Illinois, but the source says she died in Chicago, Illinois and was interred in Keokuk, Iowa. I am assuming good faith for a few references I cannot access (for example, ref 15 - The National Humane Review), which for me gives a landing page for the document, instead of an inside view). Otherwise, everything is properly sourced and there are no copyvio or close paraphrasing concerns (Earwig cites 3 potential problems, but they are not an issue here.) QPQ not required. Regarding the hooks, ALT0 is incorrect as stated, as it reads as if the study was conducted in the early 1900s by Meigs Crowder, whereas she published it in 1917 based on studies from that period. It'll need minor alteration. ALT1 is fine and sourced. I would prefer to promote an amended ALT0. A minor quibble, though not an issue for DYK: please add page numbers for cited sources. If online access is eliminated from the sources, it'll force anyone investigating those sources to wade through too many pages to find the desired detail.

AleatoryPonderings (???) (!!!) 01:52, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @AleatoryPonderings: Yes, but note that this court case is the "leading case with respect to the issue of common employers", establishing a precedent in Canadian law. At the time the lawsuit was filed, this was not the case, and in fact the trial judge ruled against Alouche (see last paragraph of background section); it was only after the case was brought to the Court of Appeal for Ontario that the "common employer doctrine" was established, and it became entrenched when leave to appeal the decision at the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed. Mindmatrix 15:11, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Ah, so the idea behind the hook is that, since Downtown Eatery changed the law on common employers, before Downtown Eatery Best Beaver would not have been Alouche's employer? That makes more sense. AleatoryPonderings (???) (!!!) 15:20, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: I'm going to inspect this again... Mindmatrix 15:18, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @AleatoryPonderings: Alright, so to ensure everything is correct, the following timeline occurred: Alouche was hired to be manager at For Your Eyes Only (owned by Grad and Grosman), and began work on 29 December 1992 Alouche was sent a Notice of Discipline in May 1993, and was fired on 15 June 1993 In October 1993, Alouche filed action for wrongful dismissal against Best Beaver Management Inc., as that was the source of his paycheques Best Beaver ceased operations in mid-1996, and all assets distributed to other companies owned by Grad and Grosman The trial resolved in favour of Alouche Best Beaver did not pay out the judgement (all its assets had been redistributed) Sherriffs were dispatched to For Your Eyes Only, where they seized $1,855 Downtown Eatery filed claim against Alouche, stating the cash belonged to it Alouche defended, and counterclaimed against Grad, Grosman, and all companies they controlled on the grounds of common employer doctrine, the oppression remedy of the Ontario Business Corporations Act, and fraudulent conveyance the judge in the second trial (at Ontario Superior Court of Justice) ruled against Alouche the case was brought to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, where the previous ruling was overturned in 2001 in January 2002, an application for leave to appeal the decision at the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed So, the common employer doctrine was part of the second trial as a counterclaim to the suit filed by Downtown Eatery. I just wanted to ensure this satisfies your concerns. Mindmatrix 18:25, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks for this incredibly thorough response. My concern is maybe philosophical or definitional. If I say that company A employs person B, that has an ordinary meaning and a legal meaning. It is probably right that Best Beaver did not employ Alouche in the ordinary sense of "employ", because Best Beaver was a "paymaster" and not the name on the front of the building where he went to work. My reading of the case itself is that, before Downtown Eatery, it was at best indeterminate as a legal matter whether Best Beaver, alone or in combination with its affiliate companies, employed Alouche. After Downtown Eatery, it was established—as a matter of legal meaning, but not necessarily ordinary meaning—that Best Beaver was his employer, or part of his employer, or something like that. The reason I brought this up is that it's not clear how one could verify the claim that "Best Beaver was not Alouche's employer", because that claim might be true as a matter of ordinary meaning but the only authoritative legal ruling we have on this (namely, Downtown Eatery) holds that the claim is false. In any event, I'll leave this to the eventual reviewer to sort out. I find my brain twisting into knots. AleatoryPonderings (???)

However, it includes a WP:IMDB source and I am unsure about the reliability of several other sources, including Film Ink, Queer Media Matters, Antaeus.org, Fern TV, Addicted to Horror Movies, Dan's Papers, Go Mag, Three Women in a Box and North Coast Rep. To add to that, the YouTube link does not appear to be uploaded by an official channel, making it unreliable. Additionally, per MOS:FILMCAST uncredited roles need a source. the copyvio checker showed up a 50%+ similarity with a source, which may suggest over quotation. On top of that, the subject has unclear notability. I'm unsure which roles are significant and The House on Pine Street appears to have a questionable notability. None of her awards seem significant and I'm not seeing any significant coverage from reliable, independent sources. ALT0 isn't very interesting given the festival is not significant enough to have an article. I think ALT1 is interesting but it seems to focus more on the character, not the actress which isn't exactly ideal... QPQ not needed. We'll need some work but we'll get there!

I personally find this fact interesting because it highlights how the advent of YouTube, and internet fame in general, has allowed people to use their voice to reach people in positions of high influence, bringing hidden ideas to light and advocating for change. While this specific example falls under a video game/pop-culture category, and may not fit Wikipedia’s desire for academic material, I feel that this is interesting enough to share, as it’s one the gaming community can relate to, like with other social media trends such as #FreeSmash and "Rerelease Mother 3." As for the article itself, all of the citations should be reliable enough; they’re all from third-party/secondary source outlets and there isn’t any BLP violation to be found here.

Citations at the end of the paragraph are not sufficient.” While the hook is sourced in the article, the refs are at the end of the section rather than per each sentence. I can fix that however. Anyway, I hope this fact does get accepted! If not, I understand, thanks for reviewing this anyway. Created/expanded by PantheonRadiance (talk). Self-nominated at 08:45, 17 November 2021 (UTC).

You'd need to have expanded the text content by 5x in length, which I am not seeing in the page history. You'll also need to resolve the many tags for additional citations and expansion in the article. Your best bet would be to get it to good article status and renominate then.

Kaleeb18 (talk) 16:28, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Hi Kaleeb18, no worries and good luck with the article. The expansion is based on the number of characters (ie. letters, spaces etc.) in the article before you started work on it and the number after you've finished.

Article is new enough, very newsworthy event and hence well-sourced, no copyvios (Earwig reports a false positive on the Johnson quotation), QPQ done. However, without a source saying the taxi driver is comfortable to talk about his ear, I'm concerned the hook may not fit the spirit of "Consider very carefully whether the hook puts undue emphasis on a negative aspect of a living individual.

Newness requirement satisfied by 5x expansion on 11/15 from < 600 to > 3000 characters. Articles also long enough and compliant with core policies on citations and neutrality. The hook is in-line sourced. Photo has appropriate license. QPQ is done. There are, however, two problems: (1) There is some significant overlap with this source. To start, the following sentence is taken from the source without use of quotation marks and with no effort to paraphrase rather than use the precise words: "Local advocacy led to the establishment of Bridle Trails as a state park in 1932." Further, this sentence also strikes me as too closely drawn from the same source: "Initial park development dates to 1933 when Civil Works Administration employees and federal relief workers were employed in state parks as part of the New Deal program. Further work included burning logging debris, clearing brush and building trails and fences." Work needs to be done to put the material into your own words. (2) The hook strikes me as boring in that it states an obvious point. Horses having the right of way on this trail is not unique or special. On trails that are shared by humans and horses, it is the general rule that horses have the right of way. See here ("In general, horses always have the right of way, followed by hikers, then by bikers."). See also here ("For safety reasons, if you come across a horse and rider on any trail they always have right of way. Hikers and bike riders all yield to horses.") To include this on the main page, we really need something that is hooky or interesting about this trail.

Graham87 09:41, 18 November 2021 (UTC) @Gerda Arendt: Thank you for the review. Diamonds were often cut in cabochon style in the 19th century and earlier. This one was cut with a flat bottom like all cabochons, and when viewed from above, it was a large oval, about 1.5 inches long. Modern cabochons usually have a smoothly rounded surface; this one was lightly faceted but the facets don't show on the sculpture. So it looks like half an egg, I suppose. The Koh-i-Noor is the large oval at the bottom of the picture. We have no specific citation for artistic licence - that is just a conclusion that we can probably make, since we have no evidence that Victoria ever had it set in a necklace. Therefore I cannot use "artistic licence" in a hook or in the article. I'll have a go at a hook using a full-length Victoria, and another hook using the Warrior and Wounded Youth sculpture. I'll come back shortly with those.

Self-nominated at 22:50, 16 November 2021 (UTC). @Ritchie333: Article is a new, plagiarism free, neutral, and well sourced not-stub (1633B). As for the hooks, I'm going to reject ALT0 out of hand, because Ben Comeau can take a number on that one. I'm also going to say no to ALT1, not because it's uncivil or uninteresting, but because it should be quoted—I've suggested two minor alts. A QPQ is also needed. Let me know what you think—nice work! — Preceding unsigned comment added by Theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) 02:57, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Re 1a, I don't see how we know that Comeau personally thinks of Trump; these could have been works-for-hire, after all. I've been trying to come up with something catchy on this -- for example, had Comeau invited Trump to participate in a performance of the work, then we could say he told Trump to fugue himself -- but the sourcing just isn't there that I can see. In consolation, here's an enlightening bit of musical history you will want to share with friends and family: Q: Why did Bach have so many children?

EEng 16:47, 17 November 2021 (UTC) The video for "Boris Johnson is a Lying Shit" includes a description from Comeau that basically screams for people not to vote for him, and the one for "Donald Trump is a Wanker" says "As satisfying as it is to poke fun at the Orange Monster, this video on its own probably won’t do the teeniest thing to reduce the devastation inflicted by the Trump administration. I therefore want to use this platform to suggest ways we can contribute to meaningful anti-Trump resistance.". We'd need to flesh out the article with these WP:BLPPRIMARY sources for the "thinks" to be properly verifiable. Moving on, 1a and 1b don't have as much impact or quirkiness you can get with a good hook. I suppose 1b is factually correct, but it's not "Did you know that Trump is directly connected to Russia or that a Trump resort is directly connected to Moscow?

Self-nominated at 07:56, 17 November 2021 (UTC). The article as it stands consists of about 1430 bytes (excluding infobox, headers, tables, and ref markers). This is slightly too short for DYK. Nominated for DYK less than one day after conversion from redirect. QPQ completed. I'll complete the review once the article satisfies the length criterion. Mindmatrix 20:30, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you for checking the length properly, I apologize for this being slightly off and I have increased it now by adding background info. I await the rest of your comments, hopefully this reaches the DYK page soon enough! K. Peake 21:51, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @Kyle Peake: Article is now of sufficient length. The background section states "Vory was revealed to have vocals on multiple songs", but that is drawn from the @TeamKanyeDaily Twitter account, which is operated by fans (ie - it is not an official account). You can instead state that fans collected this info into a tracklist. Please don't use phrases such as "Vory emphasized", "Vory revealed", "The rapper opened up", or "expressing of them collaborating" (see WP:SAID for reasoning). Also, what do you mean by the term 'considered' in "...creating a strong, considered discography..."? (Its in the source as well, and no clearer there.) There are a number of unsourced quotations in the background section; I can see they appear in this XXL piece, which is included at the end of the paragraph, but generally quotations should be cited where they occur (ie - at the end of the quotation or the sentence in which it occurs). The last sentence in the background section is too similar to the source material. The statement "resembling an ascent to heaven" should not be made in Wikipedia's voice - it should be quoted and attributed to the source making that claim. Also, is "delivered harmonies" accurate? Is there a better choice of words than 'delivered'? And is "listening event" just a substitute for "concert", or does it refer to some other event? Regarding the chart performance, VG-Lista for Norway does not include the song, the Billboard US Christian Songs has it at 15, and the Billboard US Gospel Songs returns "Page not found". Hooks are OK and sourced, though I think associating it to Bieber may detract from the intended target of the hook. Mindmatrix 14:49, 21 November 2021 (UTC) I used a different source for the opening sentence about Vory and also changed the content, worked against using language that the guideline opposes, replaced considered with a clearer meaning while axing strong and paraphrasing that sentence, as well as invoking the XXL ref for any sentences with a quote. Variety made the heavens statement, so I attributed it to them and revised the harmonies part. Regarding the charts, I was supposed to add the week 35 URL for Norway but forgot as the old revision shows in the title, I edited the peaks for the charts since I probably misread them and added the new URL for West's Gospel Songs history. Furthermore, I added Bieber in on purpose because I thought it would be interesting that West's group specifically performed it with such a well-known singer.

Further information: Official supplementary guidelines and unofficial guide  Warning: You are not logged in. Please create an account or log in to proceed. Alternatively, you may leave a message at the bottom of the DYK project talk page with the article you would like to nominate and the hook you would like to propose.  Warning: The helper script only works on desktop. Please switch to desktop view to continue. Install the DYK helper script by adding the line {{subst:lusc|User:SD0001/DYK-helper.js}} to your common.js page. Go back to the article, and choose the "DYK" option from the "More" menu (see image). Fill in the form and submit it. Check back periodically to address comments or concerns from the reviewer (it may take several weeks). Manual instructions[edit] Create a subpage for your new DYK suggestion and then list the page below under the date the article was created or the expansion began or it became a good article (not the date you submit it here), with the newest dates at the bottom. Any registered user may nominate a DYK suggestion (if you are not a registered user, please leave a message at the bottom of the DYK project talk page with the details of the article you would like to nominate and the hook you would like to propose); self-nominations are permitted and encouraged. Thanks for participating and please remember to check back for comments on your nomination (consider watchlisting your nomination page). Read these instructions completely before proceeding. For simplified instructions, see User:Rjanag/Quick DYK 2. I. Create the nomination subpage. Enter the article title in the box below and click the button. (To nominate multiple articles together, enter any or all of the article titles.) You will then be taken to a preloaded nomination page. II. Write the nomination. On the nomination page, fill in the relevant information. See Template:NewDYKnomination and {{NewDYKnomination/guide}} for further information. Not every line of the template needs to be filled in. For instance, if you are not nominating an image to appear with your hook, there is no need to fill in the image-related lines. Add an edit summary e.g. "Nominating YOUR ARTICLE TITLE for DYK" and click Publish page. Make sure the nomination page is on your watchlist, so you can follow the review discussion. III. Post at Template talk:Did you know. In the current nominations section find the subsection for the date on which the article was created or on which expansion began (or, if a new Good Article, the date on which it became a GA), not the date on which you make the nomination. At the top of that subsection (before other nominations already there, but below the section head and hidden comment) add {{Did you know nominations/YOUR ARTICLE TITLE}}. Add an edit summary e.g. "Nominating YOUR ARTICLE TITLE for DYK" and click Publish page. Frequently asked questions[edit] How do I write an interesting hook? Successful hooks tend to have several traits. Most importantly, they share a surprising or intriguing fact. They give readers enough context to understand the hook, but leave enough out to make them want to learn more. They are written for a general audience who has no prior knowledge of or interest in the topic area. Lastly, they are concise, and do not attempt to cover multiple facts or present information about the subject beyond what's needed to understand the hook. When will my nomination be reviewed? This page is often backlogged. As long as your submission is still on the page, it will stay there until an editor reviews it. Since editors are encouraged to review the oldest submissions first, it may take several weeks until your submission is reviewed. In the meantime, please consider reviewing another submission (not your own) to help reduce the backlog (see instructions below). Where is my hook? If you can't find the nomination you submitted to this nominations page, it may have been approved and is on the approved nominations page waiting to be promoted. It could also have been added to one of the prep areas, promoted from prep to a queue, or is on the main page. If the nominated hook is in none of those places, then the nomination has probably been rejected. Such a rejection usually only occurs if it was at least a couple of weeks old and had unresolved issues for which any discussion had gone stale. If you think your nomination was unfairly rejected, you can query this on the DYK discussion page, but as a general rule such nominations will only be restored in exceptional circumstances. Instructions for reviewers[edit] Main page: Wikipedia:Did you know/Reviewing guide Any editor who was not involved in writing/expanding or nominating an article may review it by checking to see that the article meets all the DYK criteria (long enough, new enough, no serious editorial or content issues) and the hook is cited. Editors may also alter the suggested hook to improve it, suggest new hooks, or even lend a hand and make edits to the article to which the hook applies so that the hook is supported and accurate. For a more detailed discussion of the DYK rules and review process see the supplementary guidelines and the WP:Did you know/Reviewing guide. To post a comment or review on a DYK nomination, follow the steps outlined below: Look through this page, Template talk:Did you know, to find a nomination you would like to comment on. Click the "Review or comment" link at the top of the nomination. You will be taken to the nomination subpage. The top of the page includes a list of the DYK criteria. Check the article to ensure it meets all the relevant criteria. To indicate the result of the review (i.e., whether the nomination passes, fails, or needs some minor changes), leave a signed comment on the page. Please begin with one of the 5 review symbols that appear at the top of the edit screen, and then indicate all aspects of the article that you have reviewed; your comment should look something like the following: Article length and age are fine, no copyvio or plagiarism concerns, reliable sources are used. But the hook needs to be shortened. If you are the first person to comment on the nomination, there will be a line :* <!-- REPLACE THIS LINE TO WRITE FIRST COMMENT, KEEPING  :* --> showing you where you should put the comment. Save the page. If there is any problem or concern about a nomination, please consider notifying the nominator by placing {{subst:DYKproblem|Article|header=yes|sig=yes}} on the nominator's talk page. Instructions for project members[edit] How to promote an accepted hook[edit] At-a-glance instructions on how to promote an approved hook to a Prep area See Wikipedia:Did you know/Preparation areas for details on verifying a hook's acceptability. Promoters should not promote their own nomination or their own review When promoting hooks intended for a particular date, keep in mind that when the number of available approved nominations exceeds 120 we switch to two sets per day, and when that number drops below 60 we return to one set per day. Check list for nomination review completeness 1) Select a hook from the approved nominations page that has one of these ticks at the bottom post: . 2) Check to make sure basic review requirements were completed. a. Any outstanding issue following needs to be addressed before promoting. 3) Check the article history for any substantive changes since it was nominated or reviewed. 4) Images for the lead slot must be freely licensed. Fair-use images are not permitted. Images loaded on Commons that appear on the Main Page are automatically protected by KrinkleBot. 5) Hook must be stated in both the article and source (which must be cited at the end of the article sentence where stated). 6) Hook should make sense grammatically. 7) Try to vary subject matters within each prep area. 8) Try to select a funny, quirky or otherwise upbeat hook for the last or bottom hook in the set. Steps to add a hook to prep In one tab, open the nomination page of the hook you want to promote. In a second tab, open the prep set you intend to add the hook to. 1) For hooks held for specific dates, refer to "Local update times" section on DYK Queue. a. Completed Prep area number sets will be promoted by an administrator to corresponding Queue number. 2) Copy and paste the hook into a chosen slot. a. Make sure there's a space between ... and that, and a ? at the end. b. Check that there's a bold link to the article. 3) If it's the lead (first) hook, paste the image where indicated at the top of the template. 4) Copy and paste ALL the credit information (the {{DYKmake}} and {{DYKnom}} templates) at the bottom 5) Check your work in the prep's Preview mode. a. At the bottom under "Credits", to the right of each article should have the link "View nom subpage" ; if not, a subpage parameter will need to be added to the DYKmake. 6) Save the Prep page. Closing the DYK nomination page At the upper left Change {{DYKsubpage to {{subst:DYKsubpage Change |passed= to |passed=yes At the bottom Just above the line containing }}<!--Please do not write below this line or remove this line. Place comments above this line.--> insert a new, separate line containing one of the following: To [[T:DYK/P1|Prep 1]] To [[T:DYK/P2|Prep 2]] To [[T:DYK/P3|Prep 3]] To [[T:DYK/P4|Prep 4]] To [[T:DYK/P5|Prep 5]] To [[T:DYK/P6|Prep 6]] To [[T:DYK/P7|Prep 7]] Also paste the same thing into the edit summary. Check in Preview mode. Make sure everything is against a pale blue background (nothing outside) and there are no stray characters, like }}, at the top or bottom. Save. For more information, please see T:TDYK#How to promote an accepted hook. Handy copy sources: To [[T:DYK/P1|Prep 1]] To [[T:DYK/P2|Prep 2]] To [[T:DYK/P3|Prep 3]] To [[T:DYK/P4|Prep 4]] To [[T:DYK/P5|Prep 5]] To [[T:DYK/P6|Prep 6]] To [[T:DYK/P7|Prep 7]] How to remove a rejected hook[edit] Open the DYK nomination subpage of the hook you would like to remove. (It's best to wait several days after a reviewer has rejected the hook, just in case someone contests or the article undergoes a large change.) In the window where the DYK nomination subpage is open, replace the line {{DYKsubpage with {{subst:DYKsubpage, and replace |passed= with |passed=no. Then save the page. This has the effect of wrapping up the discussion on the DYK nomination subpage in a blue archive box and stating that the nomination was unsuccessful, as well as adding the nomination to a category for archival purposes. How to remove a hook from the prep areas or queue[edit] Edit the prep area or queue where the hook is and remove the hook and the credits associated with it. Go to the hook's nomination subpage (there should have been a link to it in the credits section). View the edit history for that page Go back to the last version before the edit where the hook was promoted, and revert to that version to make the nomination active again. Add a new icon on the nomination subpage to cancel the previous tick and leave a comment after it explaining that the hook was removed from the prep area or queue, and why, so that later reviewers are aware of this issue. Add a transclusion of the template back to this page so that reviewers can see it. It goes under the date that it was first created/expanded/listed as a GA. You may need to add back the day header for that date if it had been removed from this page. If you removed the hook from a queue, it is best to either replace it with another hook from one of the prep areas, or to leave a message at WT:DYK asking someone else to do so. How to move a nomination subpage to a new name[edit] Don't; it should not ever be necessary, and will break some links which will later need to be repaired. Even if you change the title of the article, you don't need to move the nomination page. Nominations[edit] Older nominations[edit] Articles created/expanded on September 2[edit] Inger K.

Self-nominated at 14:12, 2 September 2021 (UTC). SportsOlympic has been blocked for sockpuppetry. Created by Cavalryman (talk) General: Article is new enough and long enough New Enough: Y Long Enough: Y Policy compliance: Adequate sourcing: N - Several problems here: Sources: "Olympedia – Inger K. Frith". www.olympedia.org. – this source is of questionable reliability. MRS. INGER FRITH, Olympic Review, 1971 – the link doesn’t work for me and there is inadequate bibliographic information for me to verify what it is. "Danish WW2 Pilots | Inger Kristine Frith (née Pragholm) (1909 - 1981)". www.danishww2pilots.dk. – I am satisfied a website run by Mikkel Plannthin about WWII Danish pilots is generally reliable (he has been published writing about this subject matter) but ... this seems to have been written largely from information gained in this forum thread and there is a big disclaimer at the bottom of this article raising some very significant discrepancies within the entry, which are included as fact in the article. Particularly the rank of Captain which never existed in the WAAF. I feel this raises questions about the reliability of the source. "Inger Frith blazed a trail for women in sports governance". www.insidethegames.biz. March 5, 2021. – looks reliable to me. The third paragraph in the WWII section is uncited. Filling more parameters in Template:Cite web, particularly authorship, would go a long way to presentation. Neutral: Y Free of copyright violations, plagiarism, and close paraphrasing: Y Other problems: N - The article misattributes several statements: likely the highest ranked Danish woman in service during the Second World War – the cited source states that she was the highest ranked that the author is aware of. She became a volunteer in the army in Cape Town and was later accepted for the Air Force – the cited source makes no mention of the Army. Hook eligibility: Cited: N - cites two sources with issues as described above Interesting: Y Other problems: N - perhaps base the hook on excellent insidethegames.biz article, something like “ that after serving in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War, Inger K. Frith became the first woman to lead a major international sporting federation and returned archery to the Olympics?” I have added it as a possible alternate above but am happy to play with it. QPQ: N - Not done Overall: I apologise if I seem to have been very harsh and I could be being very finicky, but the article is very clunky to read, with short little sentences and paragraphs that I feel don’t flow very well. Further, there is no such thing as the “British Air Force”, it is the United Kingdom’s air force or the Royal Air Force. Earwig shows 13.8% match to the Plannthin webpage, but I don’t think it breaches the COPYVIO threshold. Also QPQ is required. Cavalryman (talk) 04:08, 3 September 2021 (UTC). Hello @SportsOlympic: this nomination has been sitting here for almost a week and I can see you have not edited the article, nor have you supplied a QPQ. Are you still interested in pursuing the nomination? Cavalryman (talk) 12:56, 9 September 2021 (UTC). Olympedia are the same people as Sports Reference and is states at WP:Sports as reliable. It’s a pitty you can’t open the second source, is has great and reliable content. So the main issue is that it stated that she was Captain and the naming of the British Air Force? I’m not native English, so I can’t write it in high class English. As that is a problem, I can’t improve it to your satisfactions. I will rename the Air Force name and title of Captain because that might me wrong. Next to that, I don’t like your other option: it not mentioned she had a high rank and she was the first female at an sports federation SportsOlympic (talk) 20:24, 9 September 2021 (UTC) I can find no such reference at WP:Sports but perhaps I am missing something, there has only been one discussion at the reliable source noticeboard WP:Reliable sources/Noticeboard/Archive 335#Olympedia, that being said it is not used to cite anything controversial. Whilst you have made a couple of small fixes, you missed some of the nuance in my comments above particularly those points listed in green. Further, the claim in the hook to be high ranked depends upon if the rank of Captain (which is clearly wrong) is supposed to be an Army or a Navy Captain, a Captain in the Army is not high ranked, Navy is getting up there. As it stands I feel this article is not at the standard required to be featured on the main page, but I am happy for others to take a look at it. Cavalryman (talk) 22:38, 9 September 2021 (UTC). I have not looked at the article but would like to confirm that Olympedia is an authoritative source for Olympic bios. Schwede66 18:15, 13 September 2021 (UTC) Schwede66, many thanks, honestly Olympedia is the least of the issues here. Kind regards, Cavalryman (talk) 22:39, 13 September 2021 (UTC). It has been over a week and the nominator has made very little effort to rectify many of the issues raised above, nor have they supplied a QPQ (I was considering donating a QPQ if issues were rectified). They have received a TP notification [1] and been pinged above, so unfortunately I think this should be marked as ineligible and closed. Cavalryman (talk) 00:44, 17 September 2021 (UTC). Hi Cavalryman, I've done considerable cleanup work on the article, finding published sources for a good bit of the material, and rewriting some parts based on the additions. This one should get a whole new review. Mary Mark Ockerbloom (talk) 06:40, 17 September 2021 (UTC) It might need a new hook too: ALT4:... that after serving as a meteorological officer in the Second World War, Inger K.

DONE Capt. Inger Kristine Frith (nee Pragholm) is recorded as being born on 23 January 1909, and having served (W/265733) in the South African Air Force (SAAF) from 23 October 1941 to 21 July 1945 as a meteorologist/forecaster. Extremely awkward, and leading with Captain gives the impression that she was subsequently demoted to Second Lieutenant in the following paragraph. - reworded She and her husband eventually settled in Crowthorne. Sticks out like a sore thumb, maybe move it into the later life section, as in "died in Crowthorne where she and Ronald had established their home."REMOVED In 1985, she was credited as "the main architect of archery's reintroduction to the Olympic programme in 1972." This quote needs in-text attribution. DONE It's getting closer, with some of the issues raised in the first review have still not been resolved, and care needs to taken to ensure the correct source is used to cite certain pieces of information. I have struck ALT0 because we have now clarified that she was not "a high ranked pilot during World War II". Cavalryman (talk) 04:03, 20 September 2021 (UTC). I have also struck my first ALT1 as she did not serve in the RAF but instead served in the SAAF, so have added ALT2, with no preference between it and ALT4. Cavalryman (talk) 00:48, 21 September 2021 (UTC). ALT numbers amended to reflect added ALT3 above. Cavalryman (talk) 21:46, 5 October 2021 (UTC). Unfortunately, Cavalryman, there were two hooks labeled ALT3. I renamed the second one "ALT4", but you should specify whether you were referring to the first ALT3 or the one now called ALT4. MANdARAX • XA?Ab?AM 21:08, 5 October 2021 (UTC) @Mandarax: yes I can see the second ALT3 was added here, I have amended my comment accordingly. Kind regards, Cavalryman (talk) 21:46, 5 October 2021 (UTC). I have copy-edited the article. She served in both the Women's RAF and the SAAF, but I am not sure that the article needs to be held up over debates about her wartime service. I have proposed an alternative that just focuses on her role in sports. The article is worth including in DYK, so I am happy to step in a help get it finished. The sources seem credible to me. Are there other issues left? PMCH2 (talk) 22:46, 26 September 2021 (UTC) Respectfully, not all of the issues raised in the above review have been addressed. Further, then sent to Cairo where she transferred from the SAAF to Great Britain's Women's Royal Air Force, receiving a commission contradicts the preceding paragraph that says she served ... in the South African Air Force (SAAF) from 23 October 1941 to 21 July 1945 and the fact that to have been a Second Lieutenant she must already have been a commissioned officer. Cavalryman (talk) 12:49, 27 September 2021 (UTC). I have added archive links for sources that don't have authors. I removed the one link that didn't work. Others have appropriate details. I have replied above to the concerns I have addressed. I removed the phrase about the commission. I have done my best to address all the issues. PMCH2 (talk) 03:26, 3 October 2021 (UTC) @PMCH2: when I get a chance I will have another detailed look. At a cursory glance, there is still plenty of room to add more bibliographic information to the citations, for instance the www.danishww2pilots.dk source should be: Plannthin, Mikkel (12 September 2010). "Inger Kristine Frith (née Pragholm)". Danish WW2 Pilots. Archived from the original on 31 August 2021. Retrieved 29 August 2021. I will look at the rest soon. Also, a QPQ still has not been provided. Cavalryman (talk) 21:59, 5 October 2021 (UTC). I haven't seen a DYK be scrutinized this closely before in regards to citations. I stepped in to try to help, but it's not my article, and I have spent as much time as I can. You seem to have a very high bar. I don't have a DYK credit to donate. 22:57, 7 October 2021 (UTC) I am sorry you think I am being overly harsh, but I think it is plain sloppy not including proper attribution, and the with the example above I think the fact that the same author is responsible for two cited sources is relevant. I initially reviewed the article because I thought the subject was interesting and worthy of some time in the main page sun. But I too have found it frustrating, I have conducted two complete reviews and even then my findings have not been acted upon, and further still there has been a stunningly consistent lack of attention to detail. I will now do some editing of the article to bring it up to a standard I believe is required. Cavalryman (talk) 01:28, 8 October 2021 (UTC). Thanks for your edits on the article. It reads better and I can see you have cleaned up the sources. I will do a QPQ this weekend, so we can get this over the line.PMCH2 (talk) 12:41, 10 October 2021 (UTC) Many thanks. If you cannot I will try to do one. I also intend to email World Archery to see if we can get a photo. Regards, Cavalryman (talk) 13:13, 10 October 2021 (UTC). I have reviewed Kennin Rebellion for DYK. Thanks for chasing down a photo - that would be great.PMCH2 (talk) 14:03, 12 October 2021 (UTC) Many thanks. Re photo I have been had correspondence with World Archery and they have said we can use the 1961 photo in this article, I am just trying to get them to confirm what license they are happy to release it under. Given I am now responsible for over 70% of the text [2], should a fresh reviewer have a look at this? Cavalryman (talk) 22:10, 12 October 2021 (UTC). After some initial positive correspondence World Archery not responded about licenses for almost a week. I will send one more email but am not holding my breath that a photo will be released. Cavalryman (talk) 22:29, 17 October 2021 (UTC). yeah, I think we're going to need a new reviewer on this one. Cavalryman, given your contributions to getting this article to DYK, I've added you to the credits section. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 20:04, 18 October 2021 (UTC) As best I can tell, the major issues concerning sourcing and attribution have been addressed, and this article seems ready for the main page. Thanks to everyone who contributed to make this work. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 04:54, 20 October 2021 (UTC) @Theleekycauldron: if a photo is released I will ping you to see if you are happy for it to be added to the nomination. Kind regards, Cavalryman (talk) 05:09, 20 October 2021 (UTC). Re photo ... the person I have been corresponding with at World Archery needs to return to the office to confirm their ownership status of this picture, due to covid that cannot occur before 4th November. I request this be held off until then. Cavalryman (talk) 09:50, 20 October 2021 (UTC). @Cavalryman: happy to wait. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 20:23, 21 October 2021 (UTC) Any updates on the image? If we waiting just for the image, I'll suggest to let this nomination run without an image. – Kavyansh.Singh (talk) 08:03, 30 October 2021 (UTC) As said above I do not expect any word before the 4th of November. If there is a chronic shortage of articles for DYK then by all means run this, but it would be a shame to potentially deny this most capable woman a face when she is featured for the sake of a week. Cavalryman (talk) 10:08, 31 October 2021 (UTC). There is no shortage of hooks on DYK. I was just concerned about how backlogged this particular nomination is. If it is worth waiting for the image, no issues then. – Kavyansh.Singh (talk) 10:19, 31 October 2021 (UTC) I have just received this in an email from World Archery: I checked last Thursday in our old history books, but there is no mention of photographer there. However, I'm on another track that was given to me by the author of another book on the history of our federation, but I'll have to check it out this Thursday when I'm again in the office. Things are in progress, and I should be able to give you some good news by next week! If everyone is happy to wait a few more days hopefully we’ll have a photo. Cavalryman (talk) 08:07, 8 November 2021 (UTC). @Cavalryman: Any updates? I think this should get promoted within a week if an image doesn't materialize. Side note to @BlueMoonset: original nom has been blocked for socking, do they still get a credit? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 05:13, 17 November 2021 (UTC) theleekycauldron, I'm trying to remember. Why don't you ask at WT:DYK and see whether there are any recollections about past cases, or strong opinions either way. Sorry I can't be more definitive. On the matter of promoting, the nomination will be three months old on December 2, and should have been promoted prior to then. BlueMoonset (talk) 05:30, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I see Wikipedia talk:Did you know/Archive 152#Multiple DYK nominations in process by newly checkuser-blocked sockpuppet: how to proceed?, which ended up with every nom made by the sock being rejected. Since this one's been adopted, We shouldn't close this nom, it's been adopted, but I am striking their credit. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 05:46, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Apologies, I was going to give an update this morning (Australian time). I had an email overnight from World Archery wanting to clarify the process of uploading a picture, I wouldn’t mind betting there will be an email with photo attached in the inbox at permissions@wikimedia.org tomorrow Swiss time. I agree, if there is no image within a week promote it, this has been a lengthy process. Cavalryman (talk) 06:03, 17 November 2021 (UTC). Articles created/expanded on September 27[edit] Roman campaigns in Germania (12 BC – AD 16) ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that the Romans won a series of campaigns against the Germanic tribes following the disaster at Teutoburg, but decided to leave Germany because its land was not considered valuable? Source: Wells (2003), The Battle That Stopped Rome, pp. 206–7 Improved to Good Article status by SpartaN (talk). Self-nominated at 03:34, 29 September 2021 (UTC). General eligibility: New Enough: Y Long Enough: Y Other problems: Y Policy compliance: Adequate sourcing: Y Neutral: Y Free of copyright violations, plagiarism, and close paraphrasing: Y Other problems: Y Hook eligibility: Cited: N - Source is offline but happy to AGF. However, in the article the statement “they considered German lands too poor for annexation” is sourced to p.204 of Wells. pp.206-7 referred to above is used to support that they that “it was too costly in economic and military resources” to go into in Germany. I guess either way the hook is sourced but could you clarify the exact sourcing of the hook. Interesting: Y QPQ: None required. Overall: Interesting thorough article, well-written with good quality sourcing. Earwig shows no issues. Just a minor query around the hook sourcing but otherwise will be good to go. DeCausa (talk) 08:23, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @DeCausa: I found the web link that (for me) shows a preview if you're able to see it: https://books.google.com/books?id=mc30CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA206&lpg=PA206 SpartaN (talk) 10:07, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @SpartaN: Thanks for providing the link. It’s prompted a couple of thoughts for me. Firstly, Wells doesn’t seem to be saying the reason for the withdrawal is definitively known (“… the reasons for these decisions must have lain…”) i.e he’s making an assumption, however well founded. The hook is more definite than Wells is. Secondly, Wells’ emphasis is on the strength of the resistance being behind the reason - the poor value of the territory makes it “not worth it” because of the strength of the resistance. That’s not quite the same as just saying the land wasn’t valuable. (I notice the text you used in the article on this reflects that effort/value ratio issue.) To fix both points would you be prepared to consider an ALT1 which after “…Teutoburg” continues something along the lines of “…likely decided to leave Germany because the military effort was out of proportion to the territory’s value?” although there may need to be some trimming to get it into the 200 character limit. DeCausa (talk) 11:12, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @SpartaN and DeCausa: It's been over a month since the last comments here, have there been any updates? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:31, 13 November 2021 (UTC) From my point of view I’m waiting for SpartaN’s reply to my last post here. But I notice they haven’t edited Wikipedia since then, over a month ago. So I’m not quite sure what can be done. DeCausa (talk) 08:17, 13 November 2021 (UTC) I see. Given that there's really only one issue holding the nomination back, would anyone be willing to adopt this in case SpartaN doesn't return? It would be a shame if the nomination failed at this point. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 06:35, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I’m not sure what exactly are the DYK rules on this but, subject to that, options could be (a) I propose an ALT1 hook and someone else signs it off; (b) someone else proposes an ALT1 hook and I sign it off; (c) if anyone disagrees with me on the original hook I’m happy to step away and they sign it off. DeCausa (talk) 11:04, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I've looked at the Wells source and concur that it is saying the withdrawal was more down to the ratio of effort required to potential reward, and have boldly tweaked the copy in the article to reflect this. For what it's worth, I think ALT1 works just fine. firefly ( t · c ) 11:16, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Ok. I’m just going to formalize the ALT1 and let someone else add the tick and sign off: ALT1:... that the Romans won a series of campaigns against the Germanic tribes after the disaster at Teutoburg but likely decided to leave Germany as the effort was out of proportion to the territory’s value? DeCausa (talk) 12:07, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Since the reviewer has proposed a new hook, another editor will be needed to sign this off. I'm not sure though if the section linking in the bold links is allowed, however. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:29, 15 November 2021 (UTC) sorry, I missed that. It’s not even necessary to link to a section of the article so I’ve taken it out of ALT1. DeCausa (talk) 08:21, 15 November 2021 (UTC) As this doesn’t seem to be moving I’m going to give ALT1 the tick as original reviewer. If the DYK regulars think this is out of process because I came up nwith ALT1 then happy for it to be reverted. DeCausa (talk) 22:46, 21 November 2021 (UTC) DeCausa, there is no rush to approve, and your approval of your own hook was indeed out of process. I have reverted SL93's promotion of the nomination to prep, and with any luck a new reviewer will be around soon enough to review your ALT1. (SL93, you're welcome to review it, but that means you cannot also promote it.) I've also struck the original hook due to the issues noted above. BlueMoonset (talk) 04:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) BlueMoonset Sorry for mixing up who approved it. SL93 (talk) 04:26, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I didn't notice the second sentence of the approval...not sure how that happened. Sorry, again. SL93 (talk) 04:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) DeCausa Reading through the article again, your ALT1 hook seems to be mostly verifed in the Aftermath section, but I'm not seeing any indication of it being "likely". SL93 (talk) 21:14, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, that’s true. Where that came from was, in the above discussion with SpartaN on the original hook, they cited Wells in support. Wells says, in relation to Tiberius’ decision to ‘give up’, that “The reason for these decisions must have lain in the Germans’ tough resistance”. I’ve taken that to mean Wells’ was inferring Tiberius’ reasoning without direct evidence (or certainty) of Tiberius’ actual reason. However, you’re right that the way the article is written is more certain. I’m ok striking the “likely” or, possibly it would be better to amend the final sentence of the first paragraph of the Aftermath section to be more reflectve of Wells. DeCausa (talk) 21:48, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I will leave this here for someone else to look at. It would be helpful if the nominator came back. SL93 (talk) 23:21, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Articles created/expanded on October 9[edit] Pankratius Pfeiffer ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that Salvatorian priest Pankratius Pfeiffer saved hundreds of Jews in Rome during the Second World War? Reviewed: 1936 Northeast Flood Created by Ergo Sum (talk). Self-nominated at 17:52, 9 October 2021 (UTC). New article that was created on 9 October 2021? is 3,212 characters and nominated on the same day. No copyvios detected and duplication detector of [3][4][5][6][7] reveal no close paraphrasing issues (AGF PDF docs which can't go through Dup detector). Article is well-sourced. Hook is 103 characters long (under 200 character max.) and is interesting. Refs 4 and 5 (verifying the hook) are reliable sources. QPQ done. Looks good to go! —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:41, 9 October 2021 (UTC) Too many red flags here. If he really saved hundreds of Jews, you would expect plenty of confirmation of this in scholarly sources and him to be recognized by Yad Vashem. I can't count the number of times that I've seen mainstream newspapers print completely false stories about Jews being rescued during the holocaust, so better sources are definitely needed to confirm these extraordinary claims. Thanks Brigade Piron for letting me know about this. (t · c) buidhe 16:51, 10 October 2021 (UTC) I have to admit I'm just a bit perplexed by the argument. Except in fairly uncommon cases of multiple RS that contradict each other, we don't generally recognize any "hierarchy" of reliable sources. Sources are either RS or they are not. So I'm not sure what kind of sources you have in mind as "better" sources. The ones currently cited in the article are all RS, so that should be the end of it. I might add that if you seek some manner of official imprimatur in the vein of Yad Vashem, the City of Rome named a street after him. Your point about why there isn't more extensive coverage of this historical figure is well taken but can easily be attributed to the fact that all manner of historical figures are lost to history, especially those who are notable really for one major event in their life that did not come to light until years later, as is the case here. Indeed, one of the RS in this article describes Pfeiffer as being "lost to history." I'm adding the new review icon here so that we can get at least one more editor's evaluation of this. Ergo Sum 13:32, 16 October 2021 (UTC) There are very few people who actually saved hundreds of Jews during the Holocaust and plenty of hoaxes that were reported as truth by various news organizations—for example Necdet Kent. In other cases, actual rescue did occur but the numbers are greatly exaggerated and repeated uncritically by news organizations, such as Raoul Wallenberg. If the story is true you would expect to see it covered in many more credible sources. There are plenty of cases where a source is reliable for some info but not others. For example, someone's CV is often reliable for "they worked at X organization" but not "they are a world expert in Z". Extraordinary claims require extraordinary sourcing. (t · c) buidhe 21:27, 16 October 2021 (UTC) I should say that I share Buidhe's concerns. I think saying that "all manner of historical figures are lost to history" rather side-steps the sheer volume of historical scholarship on all aspects of the Holocaust. On a more banal note, I think part of the problem is that the sources cited are, essentially, all journalistic sources published by explicitly Catholic or Salvatorian outlets. The specific sources cited for the "saved" claim are Romereports (I am not familiar with this outlet, but the typo in the video does not inspire confidence) and a self-published Salvatorian newsletter. Neither are scholarly sources and both are, again, explicitly confessional in nature. I think WP:BIASED may on point in a highly sensitive issue touching on the wider disputes about Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust. Do we know what the Samerski book says, for example? —Brigade Piron (talk) 08:55, 17 October 2021 (UTC) Buidhe It is true that the sources cover Catholic issues, but only the Salvatorian one is actually published by a Catholic institution. I need not go into how varied Catholic newspapers are in their adherence/faithfulness to the Catholic hierarchy and beliefs (see e.g. National Catholic Reporter versus National Catholic Register). But more direclty, there actually are many scholarly RS that discussion Pfeiffer and his works in Nazi-occupied Rome. You will find them on the other language versions of this article. The problem is that I do not read Italian or German well enough to use them in the article. Coverage is not the issue. It is English language coverage. Ergo Sum 13:48, 17 October 2021 (UTC) @Ergo Sum: perhaps add the word "reportedly" before "saved". I'm inclined to accept in good faith the sources used as reliable – none of them have not been deprecated nor deemed generally unreliable. —Bloom6132 (talk) 16:41, 26 October 2021 (UTC) DYK should not cover unconfirmed reports or rumors so I strongly disagree with that suggestion. As well as assuming sources are reliable if they've never been discussed at WP:RSN, which disregards important parts of WP:RS such as WP:CONTEXTMATTERS. There is no issue with citing sources in Italian or German, but if it's not confirmed that they support the content then it's incorrect to assume that they do. (t · c) buidhe 20:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Bloom6132: I tend to think that statements are either supported by RS and written in wikivoice or they're not accepted at all. For that reason, I shy away from words like "reportedly." I reiterate though that I think it's quite clear there's nothing wrong with the sources currently used. They're all RS, so that should be the end of it. Hence, why I think your initial review was satisfactory. Ergo Sum 23:40, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Ergo Sum: agreed. I'm still of the view that the hook satisfies criteria 3b. Criteria 4 states that "Nominations should be rejected if an inspection reveals that they are not based on reliable sources". That is not the case here. —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) You're still ignoring the principle in RS that context matters, and some sources are reliable for some but not other info. The two of us who actually write on Holocaust related topics have expressed that the sources cited are not reliable for the exceptional claims being made. (t · c) buidhe 23:59, 26 October 2021 (UTC) With all due respect, I am of the opinion that the sources used are reliable for the info in the hook. The fact that you and Brigade Piron write on Holocaust-related topics is irrelevant – it does not confer a veto over hooks pertaining to that subject. By that logic, I should be able to veto baseball or heraldry hooks ... —Bloom6132 (talk) 01:10, 27 October 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: Three of my DYKs promoted (including Coat of arms of the Falkland Islands from August this year) have included the word "reportedly" in the hook, as well as numerous hooks from other editors. Disagree all you want – this is accepted practice at DYK. —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: I'm aware that you have experience writing about Holocaust-related articles and I put value in your assessment as a solid editor. However, I'm quite comfortable in my ability to vet RS, as well, and my confidence in these sources means I must disagree with your opinion here. Experienced editors do disagree at times, and it is my opinion that I think you have gotten this one wrong; doubtless, you think the same for me. I haven't seen any evidence that these are not RS. Therefore, I recommend if Bloom6132 is inclined to do so, to renew their approval of the hook. In the meantime, I'm going to request the input of additional experienced editors on the DYK talk page. Ergo Sum 01:28, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm going to ping @Bamse, Bermicourt, Jmabel, and Anyfile to see if we can find some reliable sources in other languages. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 01:46, 27 October 2021 (UTC) Oops, @AnyFile theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 01:47, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm currently traveling & very busy, so not much help here, I'm afraid. - Jmabel | Talk 01:53, 27 October 2021 (UTC) That said, more or less this same case is made in The Pope's Jews: The Vatican's Secret Plan to Save Jews from the Nazis by Gordon Thomas (not currently cited in the article). - Jmabel | Talk 02:00, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm unclear as to why the cited sources are unreliable: are we assuming that all information emanating from a Roman Catholic source is unreliable? If so what's the logic? In any case there are dozens of book sources in English, German, French and Italian that mention Pfeiffer, the problem is that few are accessible online. One is an entire biography of Pfeiffer "from baker to Vatican diplomat" which would be useful to track down: Willer, Philomena (2005). P. Pankratius Pfeiffer SDS: (1872-1945); vom Bäckergesellen zum Vatikandiplomat. Pub: Josef Fink. Others that mentions Pfeiffer and the Jews in Rome are: Liebhart (1996) Schwangau. Meding (1992), Flucht vor Nürnberg. Sinn (1976), Illegal. Bermicourt (talk) 08:41, 27 October 2021 (UTC) My issue is with the unreliability of journalistic works and popular history, which have in many cases published inaccurate information about rescues of Jews during the Holocaust. If better sources exist, they should be cited instead. An additional question is, do these sources actually support the claim of "hundreds" of Jews rescued by Pfeiffer personally? (t · c) buidhe 08:51, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I've now found sources that cover most of the article. Here are more: Liebhart (1996) Schwangau. Meding (1992), Flucht vor Nürnberg. Sinn (1976), Illegal. Prince Constantine of Bavaria (1952) Der Papst. Layer (1985), Schwäbisches Ehrenbuch - Pfeiffer credited with "saving Rome and other Italian cities including Chieti, Ascoli and Ovieto from destruction and other calamities" _ (1999). Publik-Forum - Pfeiffer the only German to have a street named after him in Rome and who fought to save Roman Jews. _ (1960). Bayerische Frömmigkeit - Pfeiffer described as the "Saviour of Rome and other cities in Italy" Robert Katz has written a number of books - Death in Rome (1967), Black Sabbath (1969), The Battle for Rome (2010) - which all mention Pfeiffer. Bottum and Dalin (2004). The Pius War has this interesting piece: "7. Pancrazio [sic] Pfeiffer. According to Carroll-Abbing, one of the men used by Pius XII to protest the Nazi roundup of Rome's Jews and intervene for persecuted victims was Father Pancrazio Pfeiffer, superior general of the Salvatorian Fathers, who also served as Pius XII' personal liaison to the German military command in Rome. Because Pfeiffer died tragically in an automobile accident toward the end of the war and thus never took part in the postwar analysis of Pius XII's conduct, many historians have overlooked him. But those who knew him or have researched his life have chronicled his collaborative efforts with Pius XII to rescue Jews and others during the war. See the article "Pfeiffer's List" by Robert Graham, 30 Days, June 1994, pp. 42-46. Prince Constantine of Bavaria's book on Pius XII, The Pope (London: Allan Wingate, 1954) [listed above] contains an excellent section on Pfeiffer, whom he describes as an agent for the pope on behalf of the victims of persecution and the fugitives in hiding" (p. 213). At Pfeiffer's death in May 1945, Vatican Radio paid tribute: "He came into contact with the Commander of the German occupying forces [in Rome in 1943-44]. From that day onwards, he placed his religious and spiritual qualities at the service of many who had been arrested or already condemned to death. He helped countless people in this way, and saved their lives, among them many Jews and other Italian personages. He championed..." In short there seems to be book evidence for virtually everything stated in the article apart from the specific details of the two incidents where 249 or 400 Jews were rescued. Based on my initial searches my expectation is that those incidents are likely to be recorded in the literature - we just need to be able to access more of the sources. Meanwhile there is no harm in pausing to use some of the above sources, plus those I've added to the Further reading section of the article in order to reinforce the existing references and then review where we are. Bermicourt (talk) 08:41, 27 October 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: thoughts? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 07:09, 4 November 2021 (UTC) I don't think the article currently meets DYK requirements. For example, Salvatorians USA Province is not independent of the article subject and therefore is not reliable for self-serving assertions such as "he saved many Jews in Rome from persecution and ultimately death" or "Every day, Pfeiffer visited the Regina Coeli prison and another prison on Via Tasso, where he would often return with freed prisoners who had been sentenced to death." (t · c) buidhe 08:27, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: would you still object if the article instead relied on the sources found by Bermicourt? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 04:58, 5 November 2021 (UTC) Depends, the Samerski source looks reliable to me but the book published by "Österreichische Provinz der Salvatorianer" has the same issue of close connection to the article subject. (t · c) buidhe 06:27, 5 November 2021 (UTC) All right. @Ergo Sum: I'm not going to promote the nomination without consensus to move forward, so if you want to try and rework the article's sourcing to approval, that can work. If you're not, this nomination should probably stop here. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 19:57, 5 November 2021 (UTC) @Ergo Sum: If the issue isn't addressed in a week, I think the best option is to reject this nomination. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 19:29, 10 November 2021 (UTC) Unfortunately, I have had to push this to the back burner. I will take a look at this tomorrow. Ergo Sum 03:45, 11 November 2021 (UTC) @Ergo Sum: Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 05:43, 16 November 2021 (UTC) That is my fault. This slipped my mind completely this weekend. I will deal with this tonight. Ergo Sum 15:45, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I have added several inline citations to the article, which refer to sources that were (very helpfully) added by Bermicourt. These sources support several of the very specific claims in the article, as well as the general thrust of the article which is in dispute here, namely that Pfeiffer was a liaison and in that capacity saved many Jews and others from the Nazis. In light of these reliable sources supporting the general claims, I think any concern about the pre-existing ones describing some of his more specific actions is ameliorated. There is a trove of additional sources in the Further Reading section that additionally describe in much greater detail Pfeiffer's actions but they are either in a foreign language which I do not adequately read to make use of as citations or are offline. All being said, I think there is now ample sourcing to back up the article's claims. Ergo Sum 05:49, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks, Ergo Sum—@Buidhe:, if this sourcing is up to your standards, we can move ahead. If not, we're probably going back to WT:DYK and asking for more eyes. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 05:52, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Hi, I've flagged the specific content in the article that supports the hook as needing a better source. There are other active cleanup tags on the article as well. However, I think there's sufficient sourcing for a modified version of the hook without the words "hundreds of".

Bermicourt (talk) 08:46, 17 November 2021 (UTC) And yet another source: O'Reilly (2001) in Forgotten Battles: Italy's War of Liberation 1943-45 states that "the Vatican was able to assist many of Rome's Jews and others sought by the Germans through Father Pancrazio Pfeiffer's intervention with the Germans... His work was recounted by Robert Graham who has written extensively on the Vatican's role in World War II." Bermicourt (talk) 09:01, 17 November 2021 (UTC) And another: Bartley (2016) in Catholics Confronting Hitler states that "Father Pancrace [sic] Pfeiffer, a German priest and the superior general of the Salvatorian Order, was the pope's liaison with the German military. Several hundred hostages, including some under sentence of death, owed their release to the efficacious intervention of Father Pfeiffer."

I'd be in favor instead of the hook being split into two separate proposals: one hook about the fact that she was an internet celebrity who grew up in a place without tap water, and a separate hook about her going viral for making hamburgers. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:23, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Full review needed, which can also address the issue of the borderline ALT1 hook. BlueMoonset (talk) 04:23, 5 November 2021 (UTC) As far as I can tell the article meets DYK requirements, and a QPQ has been done. Earwigs finds a close match with Coda Media, but that's only because it was the source for quotes in the article, and all of them are properly referenced. I find the first hook hard to believe given China's international standing, and in any case as brought up by Bowlhover may be inaccurate anyway. As for the second hook, as I mentioned before it's ineligible as it's exactly 200 characters long, and per WP:DYK hooks that are at or shorter than 200 characters may be rejected per reviewer's discretion. Both ALT0 and ALT1 have struck: I am repeating my earlier suggestion that ALT1 instead be split into two separate hooks. As this is a China-related article and there appear to be some political discussion in the article, I'd also like to ask for a second opinion from someone more knowledgeable about China-related articles if the article doesn't fall afoul of relevant guidelines. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 13:12, 6 November 2021 (UTC) From Wikipedia:Did you know#The hook: The hook should be concise: no more than about 200 characters (including spaces and the question mark, but not including the ..., the space immediately following the ..., or any (pictured)). While 200 is a hard limit, hooks near or at this limit may still be rejected at the discretion of reviewers and administrators. This tool can be used for counting words. The guideline says that "200 is a hard limit", so it is not true that the 200-character ALT1 hook is "ineligible" or "simply too long". No reason has been given for rejecting a 200-character hook "at the discretion of reviewers". Here are two additional hooks based on the suggestion: ALT2: ... that Dianxi Xiaoge, who grew up in a remote Yunnan mountain without running water, is an Internet celebrity with roughly 16 million subscribers on all her platforms? ALT3: ... Dianxi Xiaoge went viral in China and internationally after making hamburgers for her grandparents who had never eaten them before? Cunard (talk) 07:48, 7 November 2021 (UTC) Well for one thing, the original was very difficult to read and seemed to combine too many facts into one hook. Usually DYK prefers simpler hooks whenever possible. In any case, I think ALT3 is the best hook here and the nomination is otherwise good to go, I'd just like to hear a second opinion from another editor on the article tone given that I'm a bit uncomfortable doing a solo review here given the "Commentary" section delves into some political matters. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:36, 7 November 2021 (UTC) On second thought, I have some concerns regarding the length of the article. Isn't it rather detailed for an internet celebrity's page? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 11:10, 7 November 2021 (UTC) That the article is "rather detailed for an internet celebrity's page" should not be a concern. The sources provided substantial analysis of her and her work, and this article reflects those sources. Other detailed articles for Internet celebrities include PewDiePie and MrBeast. Cunard (talk) 11:18, 7 November 2021 (UTC) Pinging Gatoclass for his input, as he responded to a discussion I raised about this nomination over at WT:DYK. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:57, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I don't think we need Gatoclass to restate themself. Here's what they said at WT:DYK: The article doesn't use the phrase "one of only three Chinese influencers to gain international influence", so I'm not sure where you got that, but it does say she is one of only three "Chinese Internet celebrities who have reached international prominence", and the problem with that claim is that it's sourced to an article that is two years old and therefore not up-to-date. With regard to the overall length, I would agree that it is overly detailed and could use a trim. I'm not sure this is relevant to DYK however, as "overly detailed" is not one of our criteria. What I would say is that the level of detail does raise the chances of close paraphrasing so the article would need to be carefully checked for that. Anybody else with an opinion on this article?

I edited it a bit but it needs more copyedits--for phrasing, and for punctuation (comma splices). Also, the filmography needs some expansion; Cross the Line isn't in there, for instance.

Thriley (talk) 20:57, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @Thriley: I'll ping BlueMoonset here in case I'm wrong, but I'm going to say no, it isn't. My reasoning here is that if the hook were read as plaintext, without any bolding or linking, it would be read as pretty much only interesting as it concerns the plot. The hook should concern Smit's life; if it concerns her work as an actress, only stating her role and not anything about production doesn't make the hook out-of-universe. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 21:28, 17 November 2021 (UTC) theleekycauldron, I was taking a look at the ALT1 hook and its sources, and the second Biography sentence is basically copied from Esquire—the Google translate version, at any rate. That's a problem. Another problem is that the source doesn't actually say that she was working as a hotel receptionist when she got the call, just that it was "one of these jobs", referring back to the four in the previous sentence, none of which were hotel receptionist. The article also needs a bit of copyediting. I don't think that either of the plot-based hooks should be used, and as Drmies notes, "first film" is not accurate, since it's Cross the Line that's in the source, which appears to be her fifth film. We could only use "first feature film" if the previous four in her filmography were all short films (which would need to be clearly sourced). Perhaps an angle for the information in ALT1 would be to say she was working in whatever job it was when she was cast in Cross the Line, for which she was nominated as best new actress in the Goya Awards. BlueMoonset (talk) 02:31, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Here’s an article that states she was working as a receptionist two years before she was hired to work on Parallel Mothers:[8] Does it appear reliable? Thriley (talk) 05:38, 20 November 2021 (UTC) I don't see a reason to doubt the source. However, it isn't sufficient to support the "when she was called" hook claim, just that she was a hotel receptionist two years before the article was written (and possibly two years and a number of months, since you can't assume it's exactly two years). BlueMoonset (talk) 17:14, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Perhaps the hook should include all her various jobs before her Almodovar role?

Gatoclass (talk) 02:19, 19 November 2021 (UTC) All right—I'll ping @Lajmmoore and Victuallers: back here, y'all can work this out. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 02:33, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Was it usual for women in the fourteenth century to sign with their own name ... no. Is is usual for women in the 21st century to sign with just their first name? No. So "did you know that unusually Canada's head of state signs documents with just her first name and an R for Regina?" (Someone shouts) "BUT all British Queens do that!!" (Someone shouts) "That implies that it was unusual for Queens to sign with just their first name." No it doesnt. I think @Gatoclass: is reading the source and then saying that the hook doesnt explain every piece of information in the source... which obviously it doesnt. Its unusual that "a woman" is doing this at all. It WAS unusual for women in the fourteenth century to sign and if they did then they did not usually use just their own name. Its a fact - its unusual. Did You know that women did not sign their own names on documents in the 14th century? No I didnt. That is something that Lajmmoore wrote about and now I know. Thanks. Victuallers (talk) 08:28, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Hello Gatoclass all so the part of the source I was using is this, which is talking about signatures for charitable donation "Although most of the widows declare themselves to be the wife of their late husband, or their father's daughter, others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names, such as 'domina Margareta de Longvl' and 'don-ýina Margareta de Nevill' (the same person). The majority of widows declare that their marital status and their power to act, using a variety of phrases, including 'in pura viduitate', 'in pura viduitate mea et ligia potestate', and 'in viduitate mea propria et potestate legitima' ..." and I read that as it was more usual for (noble) women to use a signature that described them as "wife of, etc..." I read the passage as Legg using Margaret de Neville as an unusual example. Legg is talking about the Coucher Book signatures specifically, but I still think they are marking out unusual practice. In terms of the hook, I wonder whether changing 'woman' to 'literate woman' might work? Lajmmoore (talk) 09:32, 19 November 2021 (UTC) No, it wouldn't work just to add "literate". And your reading of the text just amounts to an unsupported assumption on your part. Because while the text could admittedly be less ambiguous, the statement that others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names does not in any way suggest that it was rare or unusual for a member of the nobility to give their name, it only states that members of the nobility as a class were inclined to give their names. So there isn't sufficient support in that statement for a hook which implies that Neville's act was in any way unusual for a member of her class. The hook makes Neville sound like some sort of proto-feminist who boldly challenged the system, when the underlying source only indicates that either her entire class did the same thing, or at least that it was an accepted practice for members of the nobility. So I still think that either the hook needs to be substantially reworked to more closely reflect the source, or a new hook be found. Gatoclass (talk) 02:53, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks for sharing your interpretation of your text Gatoclass. My interpretation (& so the hook) is based on Legg's use of the word most - in that "most of the widows declare themselves to be the wife of their late husband, or their father's daughter" and you rightly point out "others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names" but I think that needs to be balanced by the "most" earlier in the sentence i.e. for women generally, they don't give their name, but some noble women do but overall, for women signing their name, it is unusual enough to be pointed out in the text.

Its not completely in the order of medical articles: ie signs & symptoms followed by mechanism followed by diagnosis etc, but I see what you were doing and I see a lot of effort went here. Fulfils DYK. Well done. Thank you. Whispyhistory (talk) 16:34, 12 November 2021 (UTC) :) Apologies...I had another look. The article doesn't say " that 88.5.3.2 may not be an IP address,".... it needs another look @DrVogel:. It also needs to say that in the source. Oversight on my part. Please let me know what you wish to do. Whispyhistory (talk) 04:04, 13 November 2021 (UTC) @Whispyhistory: But that would be impossible, the article can't possibly mention IP addresses, it's about broken toes. The hook is just a hook, and serves its purpose. The example in the hook is actually given in the article, and supported by the sources cited. Dr. Vogel (talk) 06:23, 13 November 2021 (UTC) @DrVogel:, reaching out for advice...@Philafrenzy: or others can we have advice here please... reminds me of the cobblers one. It's okay with me if allowed (dyk says hook needs to be in article and in the following ref). Whispyhistory (talk) 06:32, 13 November 2021 (UTC) I don't see that exact sequence of numbers in the source, although there are others that look a bit like an IP address. The trouble is, the nominator seems to be the source for it looking a bit like an IP address, which it does, but we can't use that unless the source makes a similar point, which it does not appear to do. Something like this might work (numbers might need to be changed as mentioned): ALT1 ... that a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone may be described as 88.5.3.2? Philafrenzy (talk) 10:16, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Regarding the image, it's a fun idea but I don't think we run images as quizzes and the image is simply a skeletal foot, and not closely enough related to the hook. Philafrenzy (talk) 10:20, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you kindly... will wait for nominator to respond...no hurry. Whispyhistory (talk) 11:29, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Hi, thanks for your input. I don't see how the hook you're suggesting is hooky. What exactly is wrong with the hook proposed? It's in the article and it's supported by the sources cited. And the image is directly related to the hook. It engages the reader into a spotting game. Dr. Vogel (talk) 14:57, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Like everyone else, I rather like the IP-address hook. If we wikilinked IP address, it would be supported in the linked articles, and fulfill the requirement that anyone following the links will be able to verify the hook. I don't think we need sourcing that says that a specific sequence of numbers is an IP address, as we have sources giving the general format of an IP address, and creating an example would be a trivial calculation ("Are all four of these numbers separated by periods in the range 0-255?"): "IPv4 and IPv6 address formats". www.ibm.com. An IPv4 address has the following format: x . x . x . x where x is called an octet and must be a decimal value between 0 and 255. Octets are separated by periods. An IPv4 address must contain three periods and four octets. The following examples are valid IPv4 addresses: 1 . 2 . 3 . 4 01 . 102 . 103 . 104 This hook is better than any alternative I can think of, and I don't see anything likely to be problematic about it (it's certainly verifiable). I think we might be in agreement on that? So if some rule technically prohibits it, we might have a good case for applying the WP:Ignore all the rules policy. Broken finger is also currently DYK-eligible and I think it uses the same numbering scheme.[1] HLHJ (talk) 02:07, 14 November 2021 (UTC) [edit: add fulltext url] I don't necessarily agree with the reading of WP:DYKCRIT 3b ( Each fact in the hook must be supported in the article by at least one inline citation to a reliable source [...]) that says that the IP thing needs to be in the article (compare e.g. Template:Did you know nominations/Urine deflector, which similarly took some creative licence in how the proposed hooks were phrased beyond what was stated in either the article or the cited source), and I agree with HLHJ that WP:IAR would be applicable regardless. As for the hooks themselves, writing "a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone may be described as 88.5.3.2" is a much poorer way of writing the hook (less "hooky") than the converse, i.e. "88.5.3.2 may refer to a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone". TompaDompa (talk) 11:28, 14 November 2021 (UTC) This. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 17:01, 16 November 2021 (UTC) We can't use IP address because the nominator just thought it up "oh, that looks like an IP address". It's not in the source as the nominator admits and therefore is not verifiable. And so what if it does look like an IP address? What does that tell us about broken toes? I like clever or quirky hooks and have written many (if I may say so), but they have to be based on something in the sources otherwise it's things made up one day. Philafrenzy (talk) 10:19, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you for all your comments. This is not the place to ignore all rules. The proposed hook is not supported by the source given in the article. I am inclined to approve ALT1 but it needs checking, unless another hook is proposed. Whispyhistory (talk) 15:11, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Oh dear, this has become contentious. I think the contended question is whether it's acceptable to have verified information not found in the nominated article, but only in another article, linked in the hook. Not as hooky, but for illustration: ALT3 ... that the dot-decimal notation string "88.5.3.2" is not only an an IPv4 address, but also a fracture in the middle of the bone at the tip of the little toe? "IPv4 and IPv6 address formats". www.ibm.com., Hallux proximal phalanx fracture in adults: an overlooked diagnosis I don't think we're debating whether the IP-address-hook statement is verifiable. The statement that "88.5.3.2" (and any number in that format) is a valid IPv4 address is supported by the IP address article and the IPv4 article, and this format is the subject of the Dot-decimal notation article. No-one had bothered to cite those statements in those articles, but since they've been challenged here, I've now cited them. So "88.5.3.2 is both an IP address[1] and a code for a broken toebone[2]" is certainly verifiable, and is now verified on Wikipedia. Any DYK reader should have no trouble verifying that the hook is accurate. Alternatives that do not mention IP addressees are not as hooky, but don't contain more information about broken toes: ALT4 ... that "88.5.3.2" is a toe fracture in the middle of the bone at the tip of the little toe, while a "78.5.3.2" is the parallel broken finger?

HLHJ (talk) 20:22, 14 November 2021 (UTC) [edited to replace the wrong url, copy-paste mistake] Please don't strike the proposed hook as you have done. You certainly don't have consensus to do that. As several people have explained above, the hook is supported by the article and the source. Dr. Vogel (talk) 15:31, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I don't think the reviewer needs consensus Dr Vogel. I agree and have re-struck it. Please work on something else. I am sure you can develop something good, or tweak the Alt1. Philafrenzy (talk) 19:24, 14 November 2021 (UTC) How about ALT2 ... that 88.5.3.2 is one way of describing a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone? Philafrenzy (talk) 19:25, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you Philafrenzy ( a very experienced DYK contributor) for your efforts in helping new editors understand DYK. Your comment higher up about "88.5.3.2" and "ip address" not being in the source is true and I am grateful for your suggested alts. Essentially, the initial and subsequent hooks sound good, but none are in the article or the source. I don't wish for personal comments and don't mind if someone else wishes to take over here. With due respect @DrVogel: and @HLHJ:...You may wish to take this up at Wikipedia talk:Did you know. Whispyhistory (talk) 10:41, 15 November 2021 (UTC) I won't say I wish I hadn't written the article; I hope it's useful enough to make up for the social harm to the project here. I don't think the hostility was intended by anyone; I suspect that it's felt partly due to the ease of mininterpretation in a text-only medium and partly due to human cognitive biases.[2] I certainly did, and do, not intend it. I spent a day's editing trying to resolve the conflict by finding references specifically saying that the two things were in notation X and adding that text to the article, but unfortunately non-inductive descriptions of the notations seem to have been considered so needless that an Internet RFC attempting to formalize them died of disinterest. I did find a source that explicitly defines the IPv4 format, and one that explicitly says that 88.1.2.2 is a specific fracture, and I've cited the latter in the article, but I don't think this helps. It is probably a bit unreasonable to expect a reviewer to do more than apply rules as best they can, and Wikipedia talk:Did you know might indeed be a better forum for a more detailed discussion. I don't really want to take part in one, though (nothing to do with this discussion, prior reasons). I posted because I felt responsible for the conflict and thought I might be able to help. My impression is that I made it worse; my apologies to everyone I've offended. HLHJ (talk) 03:41, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Nobody is offended, but if I may say so I think you are still missing the point. IP addresses have nothing to do with broken toes even if that notation may have a similarity. That's why the sources don't make the comparison and why the IP-based hooks are no good. Any of the other hooks might be fine (I haven't checked the numbers) just without the bit about IP addresses. The whole thing reminds me of unusually shaped vegetables where you may see a carrot shaped like a foot, people who see faces in clouds, and even apophenia. My personal observation that one thing looks a bit like another is not the basis for a hook unless reliable sources make the point too. Philafrenzy (talk) 09:09, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Folks, we are wasting a wonderful hook. Really. IP addresses have nothing to do with broken toes even if that notation may have a similarity and that is the whole point of making good hooks. They are supposed to be short, punchy, catchy, and likely to draw the readers in to wanting to read the article – as long as they don't misstate the article content. And one of the best recipes to make a hook good is to make it sound counterintuitive With any other option but the original, we are bound to receive another hook frequented by maybe a few hundred visitors. I would propose something to the tune of in some contexts, 88.5.3.2 might not mean an IP address but a broken bone in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone? so that no one claims here that we somehow delegitimise the IP address but at the same time so that we preserve the core of the hook. As for the claims that because the hook is not cited in the IP part, it can't be there - please don't be that pedantic. In our today's world of informatics we may assume that people who visit Wikipedia more or less imagine what IP addresses are, and may more or less imagine how they look like (in the worst case they will visit the article for details). The other part is cited. I see no problem with the original. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 17:01, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Szmenderowiecki I admit that I'm not very familiar with the topic, and the above discussion was confusing, but is the "this isn't an IP address" claim actually in the source? Because if it's not, then no matter how good the hook proposal is, it can't be used in a hook since hook facts need to be based on a reference. Also, I'm pretty sure that assumptions don't count as sources. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:31, 17 November 2021 (UTC) What I was leading is that we don't need to cite that the sky is blue, or that we have five fingers; or that there exist IP addresses for that matter. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 11:08, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Given that these IP number hooks aren't working out so far, I wonder if some other hooks unrelated to that could be proposed here. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 02:11, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Comment only If we accept the first hook we will end up with thousands of hits, some quiet smiles and some who will continue to believe that DYK broke the rules. We're allowed to. This is not a massive occasion where we can save the whole project by breaking the rules. Its a trivial example of what some (not all) think may be a breach in the rules, with a small, but amusing, advantage. So I'm not asking the defenders of the rules to admit that this is not a breech ... I am suggesting that they might just concede that the harm done by allowing this hook might not offend anyone ... and it might please a few thousand. Victuallers (talk) 15:28, 20 November 2021 (UTC) We don't need to break the rules. The observation that the notation looks a bit like an IP address is trivial and completely unrelated to broken toes. There are already perfectly good hooks above that work better. Nobody is saying don't use the numbers, just strike the bit about IP addresses. The originally proposed hook is not the work of comic genius and cleverness that some seem to think it is. Philafrenzy (talk) 21:58, 20 November 2021 (UTC) The main issue here is that it's one of the core rules of DYK that hook facts must be mentioned in the article, ideally explicitly or at least implied by supporting information. The thing is that at the moment, IP addresses are not mentioned anywhere in the article, so the hooks using the IP address angle would be ineligible according to that criterion anyway. Even April Fools hooks, which tend to be misleading, are still generally based on hook facts that are mentioned in the respective articles. So if we can't even grant IAR exemptions for that criterion for AFD hooks, the one day of the year where our hooks tend to follow the rules most loosely, I can't see why such a request should be granted here.

Nominated by Victuallers (talk) at 16:21, 6 November 2021 (UTC). Article is new enough. Two correct writers are credited. The article is fully referenced. No copyvio detected. There is a bit of biased POV pushing in Wikipedia voice: "most vulnerable to climate change". This will be something our subject is saying no doubt. And this idea is also reflected in the hook with "endangered". The hook content is referenced and confirmed by the Guardian, apart from the "endangered" bit, which opinion is attributed to Tina Stege. So I suggest that "endangered" is taken out of the hook, or it is reworded so it is clear she is saying that. Hook alt1 is unsuitable as it does not link the article and I cannot tell what it is trying to say in relation to the subject. I can confirm image is CC-BY-3.0 as derived from the video with CC-BY-3.0 license.

Self-nominated at 23:51, 4 November 2021 (UTC). @DferDaisy: This article is about 3300 bytes, and was nominated for DYK shortly after creation, satisfying date and length criteria. There is a factual error, as the article states she was interred in Keokuk, Illinois, but the source says she died in Chicago, Illinois and was interred in Keokuk, Iowa. I am assuming good faith for a few references I cannot access (for example, ref 15 - The National Humane Review), which for me gives a landing page for the document, instead of an inside view). Otherwise, everything is properly sourced and there are no copyvio or close paraphrasing concerns (Earwig cites 3 potential problems, but they are not an issue here.) QPQ not required. Regarding the hooks, ALT0 is incorrect as stated, as it reads as if the study was conducted in the early 1900s by Meigs Crowder, whereas she published it in 1917 based on studies from that period. It'll need minor alteration. ALT1 is fine and sourced. I would prefer to promote an amended ALT0. A minor quibble, though not an issue for DYK: please add page numbers for cited sources.

Mindmatrix 15:11, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Ah, so the idea behind the hook is that, since Downtown Eatery changed the law on common employers, before Downtown Eatery Best Beaver would not have been Alouche's employer? That makes more sense. AleatoryPonderings (???) (!!!) 15:20, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: I'm going to inspect this again... Mindmatrix 15:18, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @AleatoryPonderings: Alright, so to ensure everything is correct, the following timeline occurred: Alouche was hired to be manager at For Your Eyes Only (owned by Grad and Grosman), and began work on 29 December 1992 Alouche was sent a Notice of Discipline in May 1993, and was fired on 15 June 1993 In October 1993, Alouche filed action for wrongful dismissal against Best Beaver Management Inc., as that was the source of his paycheques Best Beaver ceased operations in mid-1996, and all assets distributed to other companies owned by Grad and Grosman The trial resolved in favour of Alouche Best Beaver did not pay out the judgement (all its assets had been redistributed) Sherriffs were dispatched to For Your Eyes Only, where they seized $1,855 Downtown Eatery filed claim against Alouche, stating the cash belonged to it Alouche defended, and counterclaimed against Grad, Grosman, and all companies they controlled on the grounds of common employer doctrine, the oppression remedy of the Ontario Business Corporations Act, and fraudulent conveyance the judge in the second trial (at Ontario Superior Court of Justice) ruled against Alouche the case was brought to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, where the previous ruling was overturned in 2001 in January 2002, an application for leave to appeal the decision at the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed So, the common employer doctrine was part of the second trial as a counterclaim to the suit filed by Downtown Eatery. I just wanted to ensure this satisfies your concerns. Mindmatrix 18:25, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks for this incredibly thorough response. My concern is maybe philosophical or definitional. If I say that company A employs person B, that has an ordinary meaning and a legal meaning. It is probably right that Best Beaver did not employ Alouche in the ordinary sense of "employ", because Best Beaver was a "paymaster" and not the name on the front of the building where he went to work. My reading of the case itself is that, before Downtown Eatery, it was at best indeterminate as a legal matter whether Best Beaver, alone or in combination with its affiliate companies, employed Alouche. After Downtown Eatery, it was established—as a matter of legal meaning, but not necessarily ordinary meaning—that Best Beaver was his employer, or part of his employer, or something like that. The reason I brought this up is that it's not clear how one could verify the claim that "Best Beaver was not Alouche's employer", because that claim might be true as a matter of ordinary meaning but the only authoritative legal ruling we have on this (namely, Downtown Eatery) holds that the claim is false. In any event, I'll leave this to the eventual reviewer to sort out. I find my brain twisting into knots. AleatoryPonderings (???)

Interesting: N - see below Other problems: N - see below QPQ: None required. Overall: Hello, Mungo and welcome to DYK! Review as follows: The article is new enough, long enough and neutral. However, it includes a WP:IMDB source and I am unsure about the reliability of several other sources, including Film Ink, Queer Media Matters, Antaeus.org, Fern TV, Addicted to Horror Movies, Dan's Papers, Go Mag, Three Women in a Box and North Coast Rep. To add to that, the YouTube link does not appear to be uploaded by an official channel, making it unreliable. Additionally, per MOS:FILMCAST uncredited roles need a source. the copyvio checker showed up a 50%+ similarity with a source, which may suggest over quotation. On top of that, the subject has unclear notability. I'm unsure which roles are significant and The House on Pine Street appears to have a questionable notability. None of her awards seem significant and I'm not seeing any significant coverage from reliable, independent sources. ALT0 isn't very interesting given the festival is not significant enough to have an article. I think ALT1 is interesting but it seems to focus more on the character, not the actress which isn't exactly ideal... QPQ not needed. We'll need some work but we'll get there!

Thanks, DanCherek. while the article is over 1,500 prose characters, I'm going to be a stickler and say that this is still a stub. Around half the article is in the lead, and much of the lead contains information not reflected in the body.

Let me know if you find it sufficient or if you want more before considering the article a suitable "start" class. Thanks! ~ Pbritti (talk) 03:20, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks for cooperating! Moving on, the article was created from a redir and nominated in time and is neutral, although I'm requesting a second opinion on the sourcing. The article seems to be plagiarism free, and a QPQ has been done. As for the hook, I'm not sure it quite checks out—is the church expected to break away? Because the article just says that a vote is planned and expected. Once we clear those two up, we're good to go. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 02:41, 21 November 2021 (UTC) @Theleekycauldron: Not entirely sure what the concern on the sourcing is; there are multiple reputable sources. Also, the lede is fairly clear that this is a planned schism, as the hook says. While I appreciate the review, I am dissatisfied with your effort. Please let me know if I can do anything else for you, even if you're passing off this particular review. Thanks! ~ Pbritti (talk) 05:10, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Isn't there a difference between "planned" (alt1) and "expected" (alt0)? planned implies it may or may not happen, expected is like forecasting—at least, that's how i read it. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 05:19, 21 November 2021 (UTC) @Theleekycauldron: Merriam-Webster considers them definitionally synonymous terms (see definition 2).

Source: 1 and 2 Comment: This is the first time I’ve ever made a DYK here, so here goes. I personally find this fact interesting because it highlights how the advent of YouTube, and internet fame in general, has allowed people to use their voice to reach people in positions of high influence, bringing hidden ideas to light and advocating for change. While this specific example falls under a video game/pop-culture category, and may not fit Wikipedia’s desire for academic material, I feel that this is interesting enough to share, as it’s one the gaming community can relate to, like with other social media trends such as #FreeSmash and "Rerelease Mother 3." As for the article itself, all of the citations should be reliable enough; they’re all from third-party/secondary source outlets and there isn’t any BLP violation to be found here. One concern I have is criteria #3 - “Each fact in the hook must be supported in the article by at least one inline citation to a reliable source, appearing no later than the end of the sentence(s) offering that fact. Citations at the end of the paragraph are not sufficient.” While the hook is sourced in the article, the refs are at the end of the section rather than per each sentence. I can fix that however.

Newness requirement satisfied by 5x expansion on 11/15 from < 600 to > 3000 characters. Articles also long enough and compliant with core policies on citations and neutrality. The hook is in-line sourced. Photo has appropriate license. QPQ is done. There are, however, two problems: (1) There is some significant overlap with this source. To start, the following sentence is taken from the source without use of quotation marks and with no effort to paraphrase rather than use the precise words: "Local advocacy led to the establishment of Bridle Trails as a state park in 1932." Further, this sentence also strikes me as too closely drawn from the same source: "Initial park development dates to 1933 when Civil Works Administration employees and federal relief workers were employed in state parks as part of the New Deal program. Further work included burning logging debris, clearing brush and building trails and fences." Work needs to be done to put the material into your own words. (2) The hook strikes me as boring in that it states an obvious point. Horses having the right of way on this trail is not unique or special. On trails that are shared by humans and horses, it is the general rule that horses have the right of way. See here ("In general, horses always have the right of way, followed by hikers, then by bikers."). See also here ("For safety reasons, if you come across a horse and rider on any trail they always have right of way. Hikers and bike riders all yield to horses.")

For one, the quote is not actually "could have been made by aliens" so, considering this is all about misquotation, we should either use the actual quote or clarify that it is a misquotation. Then "as though it was a real announcement" implies that it was actually, I don't know, a fake announcement? A parody?

Graham87 09:41, 18 November 2021 (UTC) @Gerda Arendt: Thank you for the review. Diamonds were often cut in cabochon style in the 19th century and earlier. This one was cut with a flat bottom like all cabochons, and when viewed from above, it was a large oval, about 1.5 inches long. Modern cabochons usually have a smoothly rounded surface; this one was lightly faceted but the facets don't show on the sculpture. So it looks like half an egg, I suppose. The Koh-i-Noor is the large oval at the bottom of the picture. We have no specific citation for artistic licence - that is just a conclusion that we can probably make, since we have no evidence that Victoria ever had it set in a necklace. Therefore I cannot use "artistic licence" in a hook or in the article. I'll have a go at a hook using a full-length Victoria, and another hook using the Warrior and Wounded Youth sculpture.

I'm quite confident a more expanded article would be a more attractive thing to present to the reader (and there would be plenty of more interesting hooks. Did you know that a recently discovered 1692 libretto of an actual Abendmusik bears similarities to Wacht! Euch zum Streit?[1][2]. Or that the Abendmusiken were actually presented right after Vespers?[3] Vespers, which themselves lasted two or three hours, in addition to a further three or four hour Hauptgottesdienst in the morning?[4][5] That might be one of the reasons why the audience was reported to be so disorderly, to the point that the town watch had to be hired to maintain a semblance of order.[6] That, and a lot more, which would surely allow to take this to DYK at a later time, after having greatly expanded this. Or at least, it's my opinion that taking the sole opportunity for DYK now would be a waste when it can be done when the article is expanded and made into something significantly more attractive and informative.

I've given you a list of pertinent sources (many of which are in German, if that's easier for you), if you're interested you know where to ask.

Further information: Official supplementary guidelines and unofficial guide  Warning: You are not logged in. Please create an account or log in to proceed. Alternatively, you may leave a message at the bottom of the DYK project talk page with the article you would like to nominate and the hook you would like to propose.  Warning: The helper script only works on desktop. Please switch to desktop view to continue. Install the DYK helper script by adding the line {{subst:lusc|User:SD0001/DYK-helper.js}} to your common.js page. Go back to the article, and choose the "DYK" option from the "More" menu (see image). Fill in the form and submit it. Check back periodically to address comments or concerns from the reviewer (it may take several weeks). Manual instructions[edit] Create a subpage for your new DYK suggestion and then list the page below under the date the article was created or the expansion began or it became a good article (not the date you submit it here), with the newest dates at the bottom. Any registered user may nominate a DYK suggestion (if you are not a registered user, please leave a message at the bottom of the DYK project talk page with the details of the article you would like to nominate and the hook you would like to propose); self-nominations are permitted and encouraged. Thanks for participating and please remember to check back for comments on your nomination (consider watchlisting your nomination page). Read these instructions completely before proceeding. For simplified instructions, see User:Rjanag/Quick DYK 2. I. Create the nomination subpage. Enter the article title in the box below and click the button. (To nominate multiple articles together, enter any or all of the article titles.) You will then be taken to a preloaded nomination page. II. Write the nomination. On the nomination page, fill in the relevant information. See Template:NewDYKnomination and {{NewDYKnomination/guide}} for further information. Not every line of the template needs to be filled in. For instance, if you are not nominating an image to appear with your hook, there is no need to fill in the image-related lines. Add an edit summary e.g. "Nominating YOUR ARTICLE TITLE for DYK" and click Publish page. Make sure the nomination page is on your watchlist, so you can follow the review discussion. III. Post at Template talk:Did you know. In the current nominations section find the subsection for the date on which the article was created or on which expansion began (or, if a new Good Article, the date on which it became a GA), not the date on which you make the nomination. At the top of that subsection (before other nominations already there, but below the section head and hidden comment) add {{Did you know nominations/YOUR ARTICLE TITLE}}. Add an edit summary e.g. "Nominating YOUR ARTICLE TITLE for DYK" and click Publish page. Frequently asked questions[edit] How do I write an interesting hook? Successful hooks tend to have several traits. Most importantly, they share a surprising or intriguing fact. They give readers enough context to understand the hook, but leave enough out to make them want to learn more. They are written for a general audience who has no prior knowledge of or interest in the topic area. Lastly, they are concise, and do not attempt to cover multiple facts or present information about the subject beyond what's needed to understand the hook. When will my nomination be reviewed? This page is often backlogged. As long as your submission is still on the page, it will stay there until an editor reviews it. Since editors are encouraged to review the oldest submissions first, it may take several weeks until your submission is reviewed. In the meantime, please consider reviewing another submission (not your own) to help reduce the backlog (see instructions below). Where is my hook? If you can't find the nomination you submitted to this nominations page, it may have been approved and is on the approved nominations page waiting to be promoted. It could also have been added to one of the prep areas, promoted from prep to a queue, or is on the main page. If the nominated hook is in none of those places, then the nomination has probably been rejected. Such a rejection usually only occurs if it was at least a couple of weeks old and had unresolved issues for which any discussion had gone stale. If you think your nomination was unfairly rejected, you can query this on the DYK discussion page, but as a general rule such nominations will only be restored in exceptional circumstances. Instructions for reviewers[edit] Main page: Wikipedia:Did you know/Reviewing guide Any editor who was not involved in writing/expanding or nominating an article may review it by checking to see that the article meets all the DYK criteria (long enough, new enough, no serious editorial or content issues) and the hook is cited. Editors may also alter the suggested hook to improve it, suggest new hooks, or even lend a hand and make edits to the article to which the hook applies so that the hook is supported and accurate. For a more detailed discussion of the DYK rules and review process see the supplementary guidelines and the WP:Did you know/Reviewing guide. To post a comment or review on a DYK nomination, follow the steps outlined below: Look through this page, Template talk:Did you know, to find a nomination you would like to comment on. Click the "Review or comment" link at the top of the nomination. You will be taken to the nomination subpage. The top of the page includes a list of the DYK criteria. Check the article to ensure it meets all the relevant criteria. To indicate the result of the review (i.e., whether the nomination passes, fails, or needs some minor changes), leave a signed comment on the page. Please begin with one of the 5 review symbols that appear at the top of the edit screen, and then indicate all aspects of the article that you have reviewed; your comment should look something like the following: Article length and age are fine, no copyvio or plagiarism concerns, reliable sources are used. But the hook needs to be shortened. If you are the first person to comment on the nomination, there will be a line :* <!-- REPLACE THIS LINE TO WRITE FIRST COMMENT, KEEPING  :* --> showing you where you should put the comment. Save the page. If there is any problem or concern about a nomination, please consider notifying the nominator by placing {{subst:DYKproblem|Article|header=yes|sig=yes}} on the nominator's talk page. Instructions for project members[edit] How to promote an accepted hook[edit] At-a-glance instructions on how to promote an approved hook to a Prep area See Wikipedia:Did you know/Preparation areas for details on verifying a hook's acceptability. Promoters should not promote their own nomination or their own review When promoting hooks intended for a particular date, keep in mind that when the number of available approved nominations exceeds 120 we switch to two sets per day, and when that number drops below 60 we return to one set per day. Check list for nomination review completeness 1) Select a hook from the approved nominations page that has one of these ticks at the bottom post: . 2) Check to make sure basic review requirements were completed. a. Any outstanding issue following needs to be addressed before promoting. 3) Check the article history for any substantive changes since it was nominated or reviewed. 4) Images for the lead slot must be freely licensed. Fair-use images are not permitted. Images loaded on Commons that appear on the Main Page are automatically protected by KrinkleBot. 5) Hook must be stated in both the article and source (which must be cited at the end of the article sentence where stated). 6) Hook should make sense grammatically. 7) Try to vary subject matters within each prep area. 8) Try to select a funny, quirky or otherwise upbeat hook for the last or bottom hook in the set. Steps to add a hook to prep In one tab, open the nomination page of the hook you want to promote. In a second tab, open the prep set you intend to add the hook to. 1) For hooks held for specific dates, refer to "Local update times" section on DYK Queue. a. Completed Prep area number sets will be promoted by an administrator to corresponding Queue number. 2) Copy and paste the hook into a chosen slot. a. Make sure there's a space between ... and that, and a ? at the end. b. Check that there's a bold link to the article. 3) If it's the lead (first) hook, paste the image where indicated at the top of the template. 4) Copy and paste ALL the credit information (the {{DYKmake}} and {{DYKnom}} templates) at the bottom 5) Check your work in the prep's Preview mode. a. At the bottom under "Credits", to the right of each article should have the link "View nom subpage" ; if not, a subpage parameter will need to be added to the DYKmake. 6) Save the Prep page. Closing the DYK nomination page At the upper left Change {{DYKsubpage to {{subst:DYKsubpage Change |passed= to |passed=yes At the bottom Just above the line containing }}<!--Please do not write below this line or remove this line. Place comments above this line.--> insert a new, separate line containing one of the following: To [[T:DYK/P1|Prep 1]] To [[T:DYK/P2|Prep 2]] To [[T:DYK/P3|Prep 3]] To [[T:DYK/P4|Prep 4]] To [[T:DYK/P5|Prep 5]] To [[T:DYK/P6|Prep 6]] To [[T:DYK/P7|Prep 7]] Also paste the same thing into the edit summary. Check in Preview mode. Make sure everything is against a pale blue background (nothing outside) and there are no stray characters, like }}, at the top or bottom. Save. For more information, please see T:TDYK#How to promote an accepted hook. Handy copy sources: To [[T:DYK/P1|Prep 1]] To [[T:DYK/P2|Prep 2]] To [[T:DYK/P3|Prep 3]] To [[T:DYK/P4|Prep 4]] To [[T:DYK/P5|Prep 5]] To [[T:DYK/P6|Prep 6]] To [[T:DYK/P7|Prep 7]] How to remove a rejected hook[edit] Open the DYK nomination subpage of the hook you would like to remove. (It's best to wait several days after a reviewer has rejected the hook, just in case someone contests or the article undergoes a large change.) In the window where the DYK nomination subpage is open, replace the line {{DYKsubpage with {{subst:DYKsubpage, and replace |passed= with |passed=no. Then save the page. This has the effect of wrapping up the discussion on the DYK nomination subpage in a blue archive box and stating that the nomination was unsuccessful, as well as adding the nomination to a category for archival purposes. How to remove a hook from the prep areas or queue[edit] Edit the prep area or queue where the hook is and remove the hook and the credits associated with it. Go to the hook's nomination subpage (there should have been a link to it in the credits section). View the edit history for that page Go back to the last version before the edit where the hook was promoted, and revert to that version to make the nomination active again. Add a new icon on the nomination subpage to cancel the previous tick and leave a comment after it explaining that the hook was removed from the prep area or queue, and why, so that later reviewers are aware of this issue. Add a transclusion of the template back to this page so that reviewers can see it. It goes under the date that it was first created/expanded/listed as a GA. You may need to add back the day header for that date if it had been removed from this page. If you removed the hook from a queue, it is best to either replace it with another hook from one of the prep areas, or to leave a message at WT:DYK asking someone else to do so. How to move a nomination subpage to a new name[edit] Don't; it should not ever be necessary, and will break some links which will later need to be repaired. Even if you change the title of the article, you don't need to move the nomination page. Nominations[edit] Older nominations[edit] Articles created/expanded on September 2[edit] Inger K.

(Proposed as a possible alternative by Cavalryman) ALT3:... that Inger K. Frith, the first woman president of a major international sporting federation, played a key role in returning archery to the Olympics? (proposed by PMCH2 Created by SportsOlympic (talk). Self-nominated at 14:12, 2 September 2021 (UTC). SportsOlympic has been blocked for sockpuppetry. Created by Cavalryman (talk) General: Article is new enough and long enough New Enough: Y Long Enough: Y Policy compliance: Adequate sourcing: N - Several problems here: Sources: "Olympedia – Inger K. Frith". www.olympedia.org. – this source is of questionable reliability. MRS. INGER FRITH, Olympic Review, 1971 – the link doesn’t work for me and there is inadequate bibliographic information for me to verify what it is. "Danish WW2 Pilots | Inger Kristine Frith (née Pragholm) (1909 - 1981)". www.danishww2pilots.dk. – I am satisfied a website run by Mikkel Plannthin about WWII Danish pilots is generally reliable (he has been published writing about this subject matter) but ... this seems to have been written largely from information gained in this forum thread and there is a big disclaimer at the bottom of this article raising some very significant discrepancies within the entry, which are included as fact in the article. Particularly the rank of Captain which never existed in the WAAF. I feel this raises questions about the reliability of the source. "Inger Frith blazed a trail for women in sports governance". www.insidethegames.biz. March 5, 2021. – looks reliable to me. The third paragraph in the WWII section is uncited. Filling more parameters in Template:Cite web, particularly authorship, would go a long way to presentation. Neutral: Y Free of copyright violations, plagiarism, and close paraphrasing: Y Other problems: N - The article misattributes several statements: likely the highest ranked Danish woman in service during the Second World War – the cited source states that she was the highest ranked that the author is aware of. She became a volunteer in the army in Cape Town and was later accepted for the Air Force – the cited source makes no mention of the Army. Hook eligibility: Cited: N - cites two sources with issues as described above Interesting: Y Other problems: N - perhaps base the hook on excellent insidethegames.biz article, something like “ that after serving in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War, Inger K. Frith became the first woman to lead a major international sporting federation and returned archery to the Olympics?” I have added it as a possible alternate above but am happy to play with it. QPQ: N - Not done Overall: I apologise if I seem to have been very harsh and I could be being very finicky, but the article is very clunky to read, with short little sentences and paragraphs that I feel don’t flow very well. Further, there is no such thing as the “British Air Force”, it is the United Kingdom’s air force or the Royal Air Force. Earwig shows 13.8% match to the Plannthin webpage, but I don’t think it breaches the COPYVIO threshold. Also QPQ is required. Cavalryman (talk) 04:08, 3 September 2021 (UTC). Hello @SportsOlympic: this nomination has been sitting here for almost a week and I can see you have not edited the article, nor have you supplied a QPQ. Are you still interested in pursuing the nomination? Cavalryman (talk) 12:56, 9 September 2021 (UTC). Olympedia are the same people as Sports Reference and is states at WP:Sports as reliable. It’s a pitty you can’t open the second source, is has great and reliable content. So the main issue is that it stated that she was Captain and the naming of the British Air Force? I’m not native English, so I can’t write it in high class English. As that is a problem, I can’t improve it to your satisfactions. I will rename the Air Force name and title of Captain because that might me wrong. Next to that, I don’t like your other option: it not mentioned she had a high rank and she was the first female at an sports federation SportsOlympic (talk) 20:24, 9 September 2021 (UTC) I can find no such reference at WP:Sports but perhaps I am missing something, there has only been one discussion at the reliable source noticeboard WP:Reliable sources/Noticeboard/Archive 335#Olympedia, that being said it is not used to cite anything controversial. Whilst you have made a couple of small fixes, you missed some of the nuance in my comments above particularly those points listed in green. Further, the claim in the hook to be high ranked depends upon if the rank of Captain (which is clearly wrong) is supposed to be an Army or a Navy Captain, a Captain in the Army is not high ranked, Navy is getting up there. As it stands I feel this article is not at the standard required to be featured on the main page, but I am happy for others to take a look at it. Cavalryman (talk) 22:38, 9 September 2021 (UTC). I have not looked at the article but would like to confirm that Olympedia is an authoritative source for Olympic bios. Schwede66 18:15, 13 September 2021 (UTC) Schwede66, many thanks, honestly Olympedia is the least of the issues here. Kind regards, Cavalryman (talk) 22:39, 13 September 2021 (UTC). It has been over a week and the nominator has made very little effort to rectify many of the issues raised above, nor have they supplied a QPQ (I was considering donating a QPQ if issues were rectified). They have received a TP notification [1] and been pinged above, so unfortunately I think this should be marked as ineligible and closed. Cavalryman (talk) 00:44, 17 September 2021 (UTC). Hi Cavalryman, I've done considerable cleanup work on the article, finding published sources for a good bit of the material, and rewriting some parts based on the additions. This one should get a whole new review. Mary Mark Ockerbloom (talk) 06:40, 17 September 2021 (UTC) It might need a new hook too: ALT4:... that after serving as a meteorological officer in the Second World War, Inger K. Frith brought archery back to the Summer Olympic Games? Barker, Philip.

Inger Kristine Frith (nee Pragholm) is recorded as being born on 23 January 1909, and having served (W/265733) in the South African Air Force (SAAF) from 23 October 1941 to 21 July 1945 as a meteorologist/forecaster. Extremely awkward, and leading with Captain gives the impression that she was subsequently demoted to Second Lieutenant in the following paragraph. - reworded She and her husband eventually settled in Crowthorne. Sticks out like a sore thumb, maybe move it into the later life section, as in "died in Crowthorne where she and Ronald had established their home."REMOVED In 1985, she was credited as "the main architect of archery's reintroduction to the Olympic programme in 1972." This quote needs in-text attribution. DONE It's getting closer, with some of the issues raised in the first review have still not been resolved, and care needs to taken to ensure the correct source is used to cite certain pieces of information. I have struck ALT0 because we have now clarified that she was not "a high ranked pilot during World War II". Cavalryman (talk) 04:03, 20 September 2021 (UTC). I have also struck my first ALT1 as she did not serve in the RAF but instead served in the SAAF, so have added ALT2, with no preference between it and ALT4. Cavalryman (talk) 00:48, 21 September 2021 (UTC). ALT numbers amended to reflect added ALT3 above. Cavalryman (talk) 21:46, 5 October 2021 (UTC). Unfortunately, Cavalryman, there were two hooks labeled ALT3. I renamed the second one "ALT4", but you should specify whether you were referring to the first ALT3 or the one now called ALT4. MANdARAX • XA?Ab?AM 21:08, 5 October 2021 (UTC) @Mandarax: yes I can see the second ALT3 was added here, I have amended my comment accordingly. Kind regards, Cavalryman (talk) 21:46, 5 October 2021 (UTC). I have copy-edited the article. She served in both the Women's RAF and the SAAF, but I am not sure that the article needs to be held up over debates about her wartime service. I have proposed an alternative that just focuses on her role in sports. The article is worth including in DYK, so I am happy to step in a help get it finished. The sources seem credible to me. Are there other issues left? PMCH2 (talk) 22:46, 26 September 2021 (UTC) Respectfully, not all of the issues raised in the above review have been addressed. Further, then sent to Cairo where she transferred from the SAAF to Great Britain's Women's Royal Air Force, receiving a commission contradicts the preceding paragraph that says she served ... in the South African Air Force (SAAF) from 23 October 1941 to 21 July 1945 and the fact that to have been a Second Lieutenant she must already have been a commissioned officer. Cavalryman (talk) 12:49, 27 September 2021 (UTC). I have added archive links for sources that don't have authors. I removed the one link that didn't work. Others have appropriate details. I have replied above to the concerns I have addressed. I removed the phrase about the commission. I have done my best to address all the issues. PMCH2 (talk) 03:26, 3 October 2021 (UTC) @PMCH2: when I get a chance I will have another detailed look. At a cursory glance, there is still plenty of room to add more bibliographic information to the citations, for instance the www.danishww2pilots.dk source should be: Plannthin, Mikkel (12 September 2010). "Inger Kristine Frith (née Pragholm)". Danish WW2 Pilots. Archived from the original on 31 August 2021. Retrieved 29 August 2021. I will look at the rest soon. Also, a QPQ still has not been provided. Cavalryman (talk) 21:59, 5 October 2021 (UTC). I haven't seen a DYK be scrutinized this closely before in regards to citations. I stepped in to try to help, but it's not my article, and I have spent as much time as I can. You seem to have a very high bar. I don't have a DYK credit to donate. 22:57, 7 October 2021 (UTC) I am sorry you think I am being overly harsh, but I think it is plain sloppy not including proper attribution, and the with the example above I think the fact that the same author is responsible for two cited sources is relevant. I initially reviewed the article because I thought the subject was interesting and worthy of some time in the main page sun. But I too have found it frustrating, I have conducted two complete reviews and even then my findings have not been acted upon, and further still there has been a stunningly consistent lack of attention to detail. I will now do some editing of the article to bring it up to a standard I believe is required. Cavalryman (talk) 01:28, 8 October 2021 (UTC). Thanks for your edits on the article. It reads better and I can see you have cleaned up the sources. I will do a QPQ this weekend, so we can get this over the line.PMCH2 (talk) 12:41, 10 October 2021 (UTC) Many thanks. If you cannot I will try to do one. I also intend to email World Archery to see if we can get a photo. Regards, Cavalryman (talk) 13:13, 10 October 2021 (UTC). I have reviewed Kennin Rebellion for DYK. Thanks for chasing down a photo - that would be great.PMCH2 (talk) 14:03, 12 October 2021 (UTC) Many thanks. Re photo I have been had correspondence with World Archery and they have said we can use the 1961 photo in this article, I am just trying to get them to confirm what license they are happy to release it under. Given I am now responsible for over 70% of the text [2], should a fresh reviewer have a look at this? Cavalryman (talk) 22:10, 12 October 2021 (UTC). After some initial positive correspondence World Archery not responded about licenses for almost a week. I will send one more email but am not holding my breath that a photo will be released. Cavalryman (talk) 22:29, 17 October 2021 (UTC). yeah, I think we're going to need a new reviewer on this one. Cavalryman, given your contributions to getting this article to DYK, I've added you to the credits section. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 20:04, 18 October 2021 (UTC) As best I can tell, the major issues concerning sourcing and attribution have been addressed, and this article seems ready for the main page. Thanks to everyone who contributed to make this work. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 04:54, 20 October 2021 (UTC) @Theleekycauldron: if a photo is released I will ping you to see if you are happy for it to be added to the nomination. Kind regards, Cavalryman (talk) 05:09, 20 October 2021 (UTC). Re photo ... the person I have been corresponding with at World Archery needs to return to the office to confirm their ownership status of this picture, due to covid that cannot occur before 4th November. I request this be held off until then. Cavalryman (talk) 09:50, 20 October 2021 (UTC). @Cavalryman: happy to wait. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 20:23, 21 October 2021 (UTC) Any updates on the image? If we waiting just for the image, I'll suggest to let this nomination run without an image. – Kavyansh.Singh (talk) 08:03, 30 October 2021 (UTC) As said above I do not expect any word before the 4th of November. If there is a chronic shortage of articles for DYK then by all means run this, but it would be a shame to potentially deny this most capable woman a face when she is featured for the sake of a week. Cavalryman (talk) 10:08, 31 October 2021 (UTC). There is no shortage of hooks on DYK. I was just concerned about how backlogged this particular nomination is. If it is worth waiting for the image, no issues then. – Kavyansh.Singh (talk) 10:19, 31 October 2021 (UTC) I have just received this in an email from World Archery: I checked last Thursday in our old history books, but there is no mention of photographer there. However, I'm on another track that was given to me by the author of another book on the history of our federation, but I'll have to check it out this Thursday when I'm again in the office. Things are in progress, and I should be able to give you some good news by next week! If everyone is happy to wait a few more days hopefully we’ll have a photo. Cavalryman (talk) 08:07, 8 November 2021 (UTC). @Cavalryman: Any updates? I think this should get promoted within a week if an image doesn't materialize. Side note to @BlueMoonset: original nom has been blocked for socking, do they still get a credit? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 05:13, 17 November 2021 (UTC) theleekycauldron, I'm trying to remember. Why don't you ask at WT:DYK and see whether there are any recollections about past cases, or strong opinions either way. Sorry I can't be more definitive. On the matter of promoting, the nomination will be three months old on December 2, and should have been promoted prior to then. BlueMoonset (talk) 05:30, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I see Wikipedia talk:Did you know/Archive 152#Multiple DYK nominations in process by newly checkuser-blocked sockpuppet: how to proceed?, which ended up with every nom made by the sock being rejected. Since this one's been adopted, We shouldn't close this nom, it's been adopted, but I am striking their credit. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 05:46, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Apologies, I was going to give an update this morning (Australian time). I had an email overnight from World Archery wanting to clarify the process of uploading a picture, I wouldn’t mind betting there will be an email with photo attached in the inbox at permissions@wikimedia.org tomorrow Swiss time. I agree, if there is no image within a week promote it, this has been a lengthy process. Cavalryman (talk) 06:03, 17 November 2021 (UTC). Articles created/expanded on September 27[edit] Roman campaigns in Germania (12 BC – AD 16) ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that the Romans won a series of campaigns against the Germanic tribes following the disaster at Teutoburg, but decided to leave Germany because its land was not considered valuable? Source: Wells (2003), The Battle That Stopped Rome, pp. 206–7 Improved to Good Article status by SpartaN (talk). Self-nominated at 03:34, 29 September 2021 (UTC). General eligibility: New Enough: Y Long Enough: Y Other problems: Y Policy compliance: Adequate sourcing: Y Neutral: Y Free of copyright violations, plagiarism, and close paraphrasing: Y Other problems: Y Hook eligibility: Cited: N - Source is offline but happy to AGF. However, in the article the statement “they considered German lands too poor for annexation” is sourced to p.204 of Wells. pp.206-7 referred to above is used to support that they that “it was too costly in economic and military resources” to go into in Germany. I guess either way the hook is sourced but could you clarify the exact sourcing of the hook. Interesting: Y QPQ: None required. Overall: Interesting thorough article, well-written with good quality sourcing. Earwig shows no issues. Just a minor query around the hook sourcing but otherwise will be good to go. DeCausa (talk) 08:23, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @DeCausa: I found the web link that (for me) shows a preview if you're able to see it: https://books.google.com/books?id=mc30CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA206&lpg=PA206 SpartaN (talk) 10:07, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @SpartaN: Thanks for providing the link. It’s prompted a couple of thoughts for me. Firstly, Wells doesn’t seem to be saying the reason for the withdrawal is definitively known (“… the reasons for these decisions must have lain…”) i.e he’s making an assumption, however well founded. The hook is more definite than Wells is. Secondly, Wells’ emphasis is on the strength of the resistance being behind the reason - the poor value of the territory makes it “not worth it” because of the strength of the resistance. That’s not quite the same as just saying the land wasn’t valuable. (I notice the text you used in the article on this reflects that effort/value ratio issue.) To fix both points would you be prepared to consider an ALT1 which after “…Teutoburg” continues something along the lines of “…likely decided to leave Germany because the military effort was out of proportion to the territory’s value?” although there may need to be some trimming to get it into the 200 character limit. DeCausa (talk) 11:12, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @SpartaN and DeCausa: It's been over a month since the last comments here, have there been any updates? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:31, 13 November 2021 (UTC) From my point of view I’m waiting for SpartaN’s reply to my last post here. But I notice they haven’t edited Wikipedia since then, over a month ago. So I’m not quite sure what can be done. DeCausa (talk) 08:17, 13 November 2021 (UTC) I see. Given that there's really only one issue holding the nomination back, would anyone be willing to adopt this in case SpartaN doesn't return? It would be a shame if the nomination failed at this point. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 06:35, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I’m not sure what exactly are the DYK rules on this but, subject to that, options could be (a) I propose an ALT1 hook and someone else signs it off; (b) someone else proposes an ALT1 hook and I sign it off; (c) if anyone disagrees with me on the original hook I’m happy to step away and they sign it off. DeCausa (talk) 11:04, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I've looked at the Wells source and concur that it is saying the withdrawal was more down to the ratio of effort required to potential reward, and have boldly tweaked the copy in the article to reflect this. For what it's worth, I think ALT1 works just fine. firefly ( t · c ) 11:16, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Ok. I’m just going to formalize the ALT1 and let someone else add the tick and sign off: ALT1:... that the Romans won a series of campaigns against the Germanic tribes after the disaster at Teutoburg but likely decided to leave Germany as the effort was out of proportion to the territory’s value? DeCausa (talk) 12:07, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Since the reviewer has proposed a new hook, another editor will be needed to sign this off. I'm not sure though if the section linking in the bold links is allowed, however. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:29, 15 November 2021 (UTC) sorry, I missed that. It’s not even necessary to link to a section of the article so I’ve taken it out of ALT1. DeCausa (talk) 08:21, 15 November 2021 (UTC) As this doesn’t seem to be moving I’m going to give ALT1 the tick as original reviewer. If the DYK regulars think this is out of process because I came up nwith ALT1 then happy for it to be reverted. DeCausa (talk) 22:46, 21 November 2021 (UTC) DeCausa, there is no rush to approve, and your approval of your own hook was indeed out of process. I have reverted SL93's promotion of the nomination to prep, and with any luck a new reviewer will be around soon enough to review your ALT1. (SL93, you're welcome to review it, but that means you cannot also promote it.) I've also struck the original hook due to the issues noted above. BlueMoonset (talk) 04:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) BlueMoonset Sorry for mixing up who approved it. SL93 (talk) 04:26, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I didn't notice the second sentence of the approval...not sure how that happened. Sorry, again. SL93 (talk) 04:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) DeCausa Reading through the article again, your ALT1 hook seems to be mostly verifed in the Aftermath section, but I'm not seeing any indication of it being "likely". SL93 (talk) 21:14, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, that’s true. Where that came from was, in the above discussion with SpartaN on the original hook, they cited Wells in support. Wells says, in relation to Tiberius’ decision to ‘give up’, that “The reason for these decisions must have lain in the Germans’ tough resistance”. I’ve taken that to mean Wells’ was inferring Tiberius’ reasoning without direct evidence (or certainty) of Tiberius’ actual reason. However, you’re right that the way the article is written is more certain. I’m ok striking the “likely” or, possibly it would be better to amend the final sentence of the first paragraph of the Aftermath section to be more reflectve of Wells. DeCausa (talk) 21:48, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I will leave this here for someone else to look at. It would be helpful if the nominator came back. SL93 (talk) 23:21, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Articles created/expanded on October 9[edit] Pankratius Pfeiffer ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that Salvatorian priest Pankratius Pfeiffer saved hundreds of Jews in Rome during the Second World War? Reviewed: 1936 Northeast Flood Created by Ergo Sum (talk). Self-nominated at 17:52, 9 October 2021 (UTC). New article that was created on 9 October 2021? is 3,212 characters and nominated on the same day. No copyvios detected and duplication detector of [3][4][5][6][7] reveal no close paraphrasing issues (AGF PDF docs which can't go through Dup detector). Article is well-sourced. Hook is 103 characters long (under 200 character max.) and is interesting. Refs 4 and 5 (verifying the hook) are reliable sources. QPQ done. Looks good to go! —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:41, 9 October 2021 (UTC) Too many red flags here. If he really saved hundreds of Jews, you would expect plenty of confirmation of this in scholarly sources and him to be recognized by Yad Vashem. I can't count the number of times that I've seen mainstream newspapers print completely false stories about Jews being rescued during the holocaust, so better sources are definitely needed to confirm these extraordinary claims. Thanks Brigade Piron for letting me know about this. (t · c) buidhe 16:51, 10 October 2021 (UTC) I have to admit I'm just a bit perplexed by the argument. Except in fairly uncommon cases of multiple RS that contradict each other, we don't generally recognize any "hierarchy" of reliable sources. Sources are either RS or they are not. So I'm not sure what kind of sources you have in mind as "better" sources. The ones currently cited in the article are all RS, so that should be the end of it. I might add that if you seek some manner of official imprimatur in the vein of Yad Vashem, the City of Rome named a street after him. Your point about why there isn't more extensive coverage of this historical figure is well taken but can easily be attributed to the fact that all manner of historical figures are lost to history, especially those who are notable really for one major event in their life that did not come to light until years later, as is the case here. Indeed, one of the RS in this article describes Pfeiffer as being "lost to history." I'm adding the new review icon here so that we can get at least one more editor's evaluation of this. Ergo Sum 13:32, 16 October 2021 (UTC) There are very few people who actually saved hundreds of Jews during the Holocaust and plenty of hoaxes that were reported as truth by various news organizations—for example Necdet Kent. In other cases, actual rescue did occur but the numbers are greatly exaggerated and repeated uncritically by news organizations, such as Raoul Wallenberg. If the story is true you would expect to see it covered in many more credible sources. There are plenty of cases where a source is reliable for some info but not others. For example, someone's CV is often reliable for "they worked at X organization" but not "they are a world expert in Z". Extraordinary claims require extraordinary sourcing. (t · c) buidhe 21:27, 16 October 2021 (UTC) I should say that I share Buidhe's concerns. I think saying that "all manner of historical figures are lost to history" rather side-steps the sheer volume of historical scholarship on all aspects of the Holocaust. On a more banal note, I think part of the problem is that the sources cited are, essentially, all journalistic sources published by explicitly Catholic or Salvatorian outlets. The specific sources cited for the "saved" claim are Romereports (I am not familiar with this outlet, but the typo in the video does not inspire confidence) and a self-published Salvatorian newsletter. Neither are scholarly sources and both are, again, explicitly confessional in nature. I think WP:BIASED may on point in a highly sensitive issue touching on the wider disputes about Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust. Do we know what the Samerski book says, for example? —Brigade Piron (talk) 08:55, 17 October 2021 (UTC) Buidhe It is true that the sources cover Catholic issues, but only the Salvatorian one is actually published by a Catholic institution. I need not go into how varied Catholic newspapers are in their adherence/faithfulness to the Catholic hierarchy and beliefs (see e.g. National Catholic Reporter versus National Catholic Register). But more direclty, there actually are many scholarly RS that discussion Pfeiffer and his works in Nazi-occupied Rome. You will find them on the other language versions of this article. The problem is that I do not read Italian or German well enough to use them in the article. Coverage is not the issue. It is English language coverage. Ergo Sum 13:48, 17 October 2021 (UTC) @Ergo Sum: perhaps add the word "reportedly" before "saved". I'm inclined to accept in good faith the sources used as reliable – none of them have not been deprecated nor deemed generally unreliable. —Bloom6132 (talk) 16:41, 26 October 2021 (UTC) DYK should not cover unconfirmed reports or rumors so I strongly disagree with that suggestion. As well as assuming sources are reliable if they've never been discussed at WP:RSN, which disregards important parts of WP:RS such as WP:CONTEXTMATTERS. There is no issue with citing sources in Italian or German, but if it's not confirmed that they support the content then it's incorrect to assume that they do. (t · c) buidhe 20:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Bloom6132: I tend to think that statements are either supported by RS and written in wikivoice or they're not accepted at all. For that reason, I shy away from words like "reportedly." I reiterate though that I think it's quite clear there's nothing wrong with the sources currently used. They're all RS, so that should be the end of it. Hence, why I think your initial review was satisfactory. Ergo Sum 23:40, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Ergo Sum: agreed. I'm still of the view that the hook satisfies criteria 3b. Criteria 4 states that "Nominations should be rejected if an inspection reveals that they are not based on reliable sources". That is not the case here. —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) You're still ignoring the principle in RS that context matters, and some sources are reliable for some but not other info. The two of us who actually write on Holocaust related topics have expressed that the sources cited are not reliable for the exceptional claims being made. (t · c) buidhe 23:59, 26 October 2021 (UTC) With all due respect, I am of the opinion that the sources used are reliable for the info in the hook. The fact that you and Brigade Piron write on Holocaust-related topics is irrelevant – it does not confer a veto over hooks pertaining to that subject. By that logic, I should be able to veto baseball or heraldry hooks ... —Bloom6132 (talk) 01:10, 27 October 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: Three of my DYKs promoted (including Coat of arms of the Falkland Islands from August this year) have included the word "reportedly" in the hook, as well as numerous hooks from other editors. Disagree all you want – this is accepted practice at DYK. —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: I'm aware that you have experience writing about Holocaust-related articles and I put value in your assessment as a solid editor. However, I'm quite comfortable in my ability to vet RS, as well, and my confidence in these sources means I must disagree with your opinion here. Experienced editors do disagree at times, and it is my opinion that I think you have gotten this one wrong; doubtless, you think the same for me. I haven't seen any evidence that these are not RS. Therefore, I recommend if Bloom6132 is inclined to do so, to renew their approval of the hook. In the meantime, I'm going to request the input of additional experienced editors on the DYK talk page. Ergo Sum 01:28, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm going to ping @Bamse, Bermicourt, Jmabel, and Anyfile to see if we can find some reliable sources in other languages. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 01:46, 27 October 2021 (UTC) Oops, @AnyFile theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 01:47, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm currently traveling & very busy, so not much help here, I'm afraid. - Jmabel | Talk 01:53, 27 October 2021 (UTC) That said, more or less this same case is made in The Pope's Jews: The Vatican's Secret Plan to Save Jews from the Nazis by Gordon Thomas (not currently cited in the article). - Jmabel | Talk 02:00, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm unclear as to why the cited sources are unreliable: are we assuming that all information emanating from a Roman Catholic source is unreliable? If so what's the logic? In any case there are dozens of book sources in English, German, French and Italian that mention Pfeiffer, the problem is that few are accessible online. One is an entire biography of Pfeiffer "from baker to Vatican diplomat" which would be useful to track down: Willer, Philomena (2005). P. Pankratius Pfeiffer SDS: (1872-1945); vom Bäckergesellen zum Vatikandiplomat. Pub: Josef Fink. Others that mentions Pfeiffer and the Jews in Rome are: Liebhart (1996) Schwangau. Meding (1992), Flucht vor Nürnberg. Sinn (1976), Illegal. Bermicourt (talk) 08:41, 27 October 2021 (UTC) My issue is with the unreliability of journalistic works and popular history, which have in many cases published inaccurate information about rescues of Jews during the Holocaust. If better sources exist, they should be cited instead. An additional question is, do these sources actually support the claim of "hundreds" of Jews rescued by Pfeiffer personally? (t · c) buidhe 08:51, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I've now found sources that cover most of the article. Here are more: Liebhart (1996) Schwangau. Meding (1992), Flucht vor Nürnberg. Sinn (1976), Illegal. Prince Constantine of Bavaria (1952) Der Papst. Layer (1985), Schwäbisches Ehrenbuch - Pfeiffer credited with "saving Rome and other Italian cities including Chieti, Ascoli and Ovieto from destruction and other calamities" _ (1999). Publik-Forum - Pfeiffer the only German to have a street named after him in Rome and who fought to save Roman Jews. _ (1960). Bayerische Frömmigkeit - Pfeiffer described as the "Saviour of Rome and other cities in Italy" Robert Katz has written a number of books - Death in Rome (1967), Black Sabbath (1969), The Battle for Rome (2010) - which all mention Pfeiffer. Bottum and Dalin (2004). The Pius War has this interesting piece: "7. Pancrazio [sic] Pfeiffer. According to Carroll-Abbing, one of the men used by Pius XII to protest the Nazi roundup of Rome's Jews and intervene for persecuted victims was Father Pancrazio Pfeiffer, superior general of the Salvatorian Fathers, who also served as Pius XII' personal liaison to the German military command in Rome. Because Pfeiffer died tragically in an automobile accident toward the end of the war and thus never took part in the postwar analysis of Pius XII's conduct, many historians have overlooked him. But those who knew him or have researched his life have chronicled his collaborative efforts with Pius XII to rescue Jews and others during the war. See the article "Pfeiffer's List" by Robert Graham, 30 Days, June 1994, pp. 42-46. Prince Constantine of Bavaria's book on Pius XII, The Pope (London: Allan Wingate, 1954) [listed above] contains an excellent section on Pfeiffer, whom he describes as an agent for the pope on behalf of the victims of persecution and the fugitives in hiding" (p. 213). At Pfeiffer's death in May 1945, Vatican Radio paid tribute: "He came into contact with the Commander of the German occupying forces [in Rome in 1943-44]. From that day onwards, he placed his religious and spiritual qualities at the service of many who had been arrested or already condemned to death. He helped countless people in this way, and saved their lives, among them many Jews and other Italian personages. He championed..." In short there seems to be book evidence for virtually everything stated in the article apart from the specific details of the two incidents where 249 or 400 Jews were rescued. Based on my initial searches my expectation is that those incidents are likely to be recorded in the literature - we just need to be able to access more of the sources. Meanwhile there is no harm in pausing to use some of the above sources, plus those I've added to the Further reading section of the article in order to reinforce the existing references and then review where we are. Bermicourt (talk) 08:41, 27 October 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: thoughts? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 07:09, 4 November 2021 (UTC) I don't think the article currently meets DYK requirements. For example, Salvatorians USA Province is not independent of the article subject and therefore is not reliable for self-serving assertions such as "he saved many Jews in Rome from persecution and ultimately death" or "Every day, Pfeiffer visited the Regina Coeli prison and another prison on Via Tasso, where he would often return with freed prisoners who had been sentenced to death." (t · c) buidhe 08:27, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: would you still object if the article instead relied on the sources found by Bermicourt? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 04:58, 5 November 2021 (UTC) Depends, the Samerski source looks reliable to me but the book published by "Österreichische Provinz der Salvatorianer" has the same issue of close connection to the article subject.

Ergo Sum 15:45, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I have added several inline citations to the article, which refer to sources that were (very helpfully) added by Bermicourt. These sources support several of the very specific claims in the article, as well as the general thrust of the article which is in dispute here, namely that Pfeiffer was a liaison and in that capacity saved many Jews and others from the Nazis. In light of these reliable sources supporting the general claims, I think any concern about the pre-existing ones describing some of his more specific actions is ameliorated. There is a trove of additional sources in the Further Reading section that additionally describe in much greater detail Pfeiffer's actions but they are either in a foreign language which I do not adequately read to make use of as citations or are offline. All being said, I think there is now ample sourcing to back up the article's claims. Ergo Sum 05:49, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks, Ergo Sum—@Buidhe:, if this sourcing is up to your standards, we can move ahead. If not, we're probably going back to WT:DYK and asking for more eyes. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 05:52, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Hi, I've flagged the specific content in the article that supports the hook as needing a better source. There are other active cleanup tags on the article as well. However, I think there's sufficient sourcing for a modified version of the hook without the words "hundreds of". (t · c) buidhe 06:06, 17 November 2021 (UTC) We could cite "countless" using the ref above instead of "hundreds of". Bermicourt (talk) 08:33, 17 November 2021 (UTC) According to the source it's what Vatican Radio said about him after his death. DYK is not for eulogies imo. (t · c) buidhe 08:37, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I'm not following—is the source unreliable because it's after his death? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 08:40, 17 November 2021 (UTC) No, it's because it's Catholic presumably... We could always add "according to Vatican Radio..." But better still, we just need to cite the exact text from one of the many non-Catholic book sources and the problem will be solved. Bermicourt (talk) 08:46, 17 November 2021 (UTC) And yet another source: O'Reilly (2001) in Forgotten Battles: Italy's War of Liberation 1943-45 states that "the Vatican was able to assist many of Rome's Jews and others sought by the Germans through Father Pancrazio Pfeiffer's intervention with the Germans... His work was recounted by Robert Graham who has written extensively on the Vatican's role in World War II." Bermicourt (talk) 09:01, 17 November 2021 (UTC) And another: Bartley (2016) in Catholics Confronting Hitler states that "Father Pancrace [sic] Pfeiffer, a German priest and the superior general of the Salvatorian Order, was the pope's liaison with the German military. Several hundred hostages, including some under sentence of death, owed their release to the efficacious intervention of Father Pfeiffer." I don't know why I'm doing this - you can look up the references yourselves instead of opining and speculating from the sidelines in the classic Wikipedia way. :) Bermicourt (talk) 09:08, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @Bermicourt: Since it seems you have access to several sources that I do not (probably just requires further digging), would you want to add them as inline citations with page numbers, especially to support the proposition regarding hundreds of people saved?

I'd be in favor instead of the hook being split into two separate proposals: one hook about the fact that she was an internet celebrity who grew up in a place without tap water, and a separate hook about her going viral for making hamburgers. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:23, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Full review needed, which can also address the issue of the borderline ALT1 hook. BlueMoonset (talk) 04:23, 5 November 2021 (UTC) As far as I can tell the article meets DYK requirements, and a QPQ has been done. Earwigs finds a close match with Coda Media, but that's only because it was the source for quotes in the article, and all of them are properly referenced. I find the first hook hard to believe given China's international standing, and in any case as brought up by Bowlhover may be inaccurate anyway. As for the second hook, as I mentioned before it's ineligible as it's exactly 200 characters long, and per WP:DYK hooks that are at or shorter than 200 characters may be rejected per reviewer's discretion. Both ALT0 and ALT1 have struck: I am repeating my earlier suggestion that ALT1 instead be split into two separate hooks. As this is a China-related article and there appear to be some political discussion in the article, I'd also like to ask for a second opinion from someone more knowledgeable about China-related articles if the article doesn't fall afoul of relevant guidelines. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 13:12, 6 November 2021 (UTC) From Wikipedia:Did you know#The hook: The hook should be concise: no more than about 200 characters (including spaces and the question mark, but not including the ..., the space immediately following the ..., or any (pictured)). While 200 is a hard limit, hooks near or at this limit may still be rejected at the discretion of reviewers and administrators. This tool can be used for counting words. The guideline says that "200 is a hard limit", so it is not true that the 200-character ALT1 hook is "ineligible" or "simply too long". No reason has been given for rejecting a 200-character hook "at the discretion of reviewers". Here are two additional hooks based on the suggestion: ALT2: ... that Dianxi Xiaoge, who grew up in a remote Yunnan mountain without running water, is an Internet celebrity with roughly 16 million subscribers on all her platforms? ALT3: ... Dianxi Xiaoge went viral in China and internationally after making hamburgers for her grandparents who had never eaten them before? Cunard (talk) 07:48, 7 November 2021 (UTC) Well for one thing, the original was very difficult to read and seemed to combine too many facts into one hook. Usually DYK prefers simpler hooks whenever possible. In any case, I think ALT3 is the best hook here and the nomination is otherwise good to go, I'd just like to hear a second opinion from another editor on the article tone given that I'm a bit uncomfortable doing a solo review here given the "Commentary" section delves into some political matters. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:36, 7 November 2021 (UTC) On second thought, I have some concerns regarding the length of the article. Isn't it rather detailed for an internet celebrity's page? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 11:10, 7 November 2021 (UTC) That the article is "rather detailed for an internet celebrity's page" should not be a concern. The sources provided substantial analysis of her and her work, and this article reflects those sources. Other detailed articles for Internet celebrities include PewDiePie and MrBeast. Cunard (talk) 11:18, 7 November 2021 (UTC) Pinging Gatoclass for his input, as he responded to a discussion I raised about this nomination over at WT:DYK. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:57, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I don't think we need Gatoclass to restate themself. Here's what they said at WT:DYK: The article doesn't use the phrase "one of only three Chinese influencers to gain international influence", so I'm not sure where you got that, but it does say she is one of only three "Chinese Internet celebrities who have reached international prominence", and the problem with that claim is that it's sourced to an article that is two years old and therefore not up-to-date. With regard to the overall length, I would agree that it is overly detailed and could use a trim. I'm not sure this is relevant to DYK however, as "overly detailed" is not one of our criteria. What I would say is that the level of detail does raise the chances of close paraphrasing so the article would need to be carefully checked for that. Anybody else with an opinion on this article?

I edited it a bit but it needs more copyedits--for phrasing, and for punctuation (comma splices). Also, the filmography needs some expansion; Cross the Line isn't in there, for instance.

Thriley (talk) 20:57, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @Thriley: I'll ping BlueMoonset here in case I'm wrong, but I'm going to say no, it isn't. My reasoning here is that if the hook were read as plaintext, without any bolding or linking, it would be read as pretty much only interesting as it concerns the plot. The hook should concern Smit's life; if it concerns her work as an actress, only stating her role and not anything about production doesn't make the hook out-of-universe. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 21:28, 17 November 2021 (UTC) theleekycauldron, I was taking a look at the ALT1 hook and its sources, and the second Biography sentence is basically copied from Esquire—the Google translate version, at any rate. That's a problem. Another problem is that the source doesn't actually say that she was working as a hotel receptionist when she got the call, just that it was "one of these jobs", referring back to the four in the previous sentence, none of which were hotel receptionist. The article also needs a bit of copyediting. I don't think that either of the plot-based hooks should be used, and as Drmies notes, "first film" is not accurate, since it's Cross the Line that's in the source, which appears to be her fifth film. We could only use "first feature film" if the previous four in her filmography were all short films (which would need to be clearly sourced). Perhaps an angle for the information in ALT1 would be to say she was working in whatever job it was when she was cast in Cross the Line, for which she was nominated as best new actress in the Goya Awards. BlueMoonset (talk) 02:31, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Here’s an article that states she was working as a receptionist two years before she was hired to work on Parallel Mothers:[8] Does it appear reliable? Thriley (talk) 05:38, 20 November 2021 (UTC) I don't see a reason to doubt the source. However, it isn't sufficient to support the "when she was called" hook claim, just that she was a hotel receptionist two years before the article was written (and possibly two years and a number of months, since you can't assume it's exactly two years).

To be expected, since they're cited almost 20 times each, and since the vast majority of the matches concern long quotes I'm willing to overlook it, but can we add more citations throughout the paragraphs? Particularly with "Conflict with Miles and Reynolds", there's four citations crammed at the end of the section. I think we should cite each after the corresponding sentences, especially where there's a direct quotation. Also for ALT0 we need a citation at the ends of the sentences for "Golden Boy" and "Whiz Kid". Otherwise nice read, and good use of sources. DigitalIceAge (talk) 20:56, 13 November 2021 (UTC) @DigitalIceAge: I will look into distributing refs :) Kingsif (talk) 00:20, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Articles created/expanded on October 29[edit] Margaret de Neville ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that unusually for a woman in fourteenth century England, Margaret de Neville used her own name as her signature? Source: Legg, Katrina Jane (2002) An edition of the Coucher Book and charters of Bolton Priory (Yorkshire). PhD thesis, University of Sheffield. 174. ... that she wasn't the "wife of" or "daughter of" as the 14th century noble signed herself simply domina Margareta de Nevill? Reviewed: Template:Did you know nominations/Monument to the King's Liverpool Regiment Created by Lajmmoore (talk). Self-nominated at 12:18, 5 November 2021 (UTC). Its long enough and new and lots of good refs - including the hook fact. It documents a notable woman from the 14th century and there were not many of those. There is no image, its well written and I offer an alternative phrasing of the hook, but its up to someone else to decide if its ok. No evidence of close paraphrasing I could see. Nice addition. well done Victuallers (talk) 10:31, 6 November 2021 (UTC) Reopening this because I think the hook is misleading, as according to the source it was usual for women of the nobility, like Neville, to sign with their own names. Gatoclass (talk) 02:10, 19 November 2021 (UTC) @Gatoclass: I don't think most will know that, so maybe we go with ALT1 or some variation on it? We don't need to say it's unusual if we phrase it that way theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 02:14, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Theleekycauldron, the problem with both hooks is that they imply that there was something out-of-the-ordinary in a woman signing something in her own name in that era, whereas the source indicates that was normal practice for women of the nobility. So the hooks are misleading. Gatoclass (talk) 02:19, 19 November 2021 (UTC) All right—I'll ping @Lajmmoore and Victuallers: back here, y'all can work this out. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 02:33, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Was it usual for women in the fourteenth century to sign with their own name ... no. Is is usual for women in the 21st century to sign with just their first name? No. So "did you know that unusually Canada's head of state signs documents with just her first name and an R for Regina?" (Someone shouts) "BUT all British Queens do that!!" (Someone shouts) "That implies that it was unusual for Queens to sign with just their first name." No it doesnt. I think @Gatoclass: is reading the source and then saying that the hook doesnt explain every piece of information in the source... which obviously it doesnt. Its unusual that "a woman" is doing this at all. It WAS unusual for women in the fourteenth century to sign and if they did then they did not usually use just their own name. Its a fact - its unusual. Did You know that women did not sign their own names on documents in the 14th century? No I didnt. That is something that Lajmmoore wrote about and now I know. Thanks. Victuallers (talk) 08:28, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Hello Gatoclass all so the part of the source I was using is this, which is talking about signatures for charitable donation "Although most of the widows declare themselves to be the wife of their late husband, or their father's daughter, others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names, such as 'domina Margareta de Longvl' and 'don-ýina Margareta de Nevill' (the same person). The majority of widows declare that their marital status and their power to act, using a variety of phrases, including 'in pura viduitate', 'in pura viduitate mea et ligia potestate', and 'in viduitate mea propria et potestate legitima' ..." and I read that as it was more usual for (noble) women to use a signature that described them as "wife of, etc..." I read the passage as Legg using Margaret de Neville as an unusual example. Legg is talking about the Coucher Book signatures specifically, but I still think they are marking out unusual practice. In terms of the hook, I wonder whether changing 'woman' to 'literate woman' might work? Lajmmoore (talk) 09:32, 19 November 2021 (UTC) No, it wouldn't work just to add "literate". And your reading of the text just amounts to an unsupported assumption on your part. Because while the text could admittedly be less ambiguous, the statement that others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names does not in any way suggest that it was rare or unusual for a member of the nobility to give their name, it only states that members of the nobility as a class were inclined to give their names. So there isn't sufficient support in that statement for a hook which implies that Neville's act was in any way unusual for a member of her class. The hook makes Neville sound like some sort of proto-feminist who boldly challenged the system, when the underlying source only indicates that either her entire class did the same thing, or at least that it was an accepted practice for members of the nobility. So I still think that either the hook needs to be substantially reworked to more closely reflect the source, or a new hook be found. Gatoclass (talk) 02:53, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks for sharing your interpretation of your text Gatoclass. My interpretation (& so the hook) is based on Legg's use of the word most - in that "most of the widows declare themselves to be the wife of their late husband, or their father's daughter" and you rightly point out "others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names" but I think that needs to be balanced by the "most" earlier in the sentence i.e. for women generally, they don't give their name, but some noble women do but overall, for women signing their name, it is unusual enough to be pointed out in the text.

Its not completely in the order of medical articles: ie signs & symptoms followed by mechanism followed by diagnosis etc, but I see what you were doing and I see a lot of effort went here. Fulfils DYK. Well done. Thank you. Whispyhistory (talk) 16:34, 12 November 2021 (UTC) :) Apologies...I had another look. The article doesn't say " that 88.5.3.2 may not be an IP address,".... it needs another look @DrVogel:. It also needs to say that in the source. Oversight on my part. Please let me know what you wish to do. Whispyhistory (talk) 04:04, 13 November 2021 (UTC) @Whispyhistory: But that would be impossible, the article can't possibly mention IP addresses, it's about broken toes. The hook is just a hook, and serves its purpose. The example in the hook is actually given in the article, and supported by the sources cited. Dr. Vogel (talk) 06:23, 13 November 2021 (UTC) @DrVogel:, reaching out for advice...@Philafrenzy: or others can we have advice here please... reminds me of the cobblers one. It's okay with me if allowed (dyk says hook needs to be in article and in the following ref). Whispyhistory (talk) 06:32, 13 November 2021 (UTC) I don't see that exact sequence of numbers in the source, although there are others that look a bit like an IP address. The trouble is, the nominator seems to be the source for it looking a bit like an IP address, which it does, but we can't use that unless the source makes a similar point, which it does not appear to do. Something like this might work (numbers might need to be changed as mentioned): ALT1 ... that a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone may be described as 88.5.3.2? Philafrenzy (talk) 10:16, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Regarding the image, it's a fun idea but I don't think we run images as quizzes and the image is simply a skeletal foot, and not closely enough related to the hook. Philafrenzy (talk) 10:20, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you kindly... will wait for nominator to respond...no hurry. Whispyhistory (talk) 11:29, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Hi, thanks for your input. I don't see how the hook you're suggesting is hooky. What exactly is wrong with the hook proposed? It's in the article and it's supported by the sources cited. And the image is directly related to the hook. It engages the reader into a spotting game. Dr. Vogel (talk) 14:57, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Like everyone else, I rather like the IP-address hook. If we wikilinked IP address, it would be supported in the linked articles, and fulfill the requirement that anyone following the links will be able to verify the hook. I don't think we need sourcing that says that a specific sequence of numbers is an IP address, as we have sources giving the general format of an IP address, and creating an example would be a trivial calculation ("Are all four of these numbers separated by periods in the range 0-255?"): "IPv4 and IPv6 address formats". www.ibm.com. An IPv4 address has the following format: x . x . x . x where x is called an octet and must be a decimal value between 0 and 255. Octets are separated by periods. An IPv4 address must contain three periods and four octets. The following examples are valid IPv4 addresses: 1 . 2 . 3 . 4 01 . 102 . 103 . 104 This hook is better than any alternative I can think of, and I don't see anything likely to be problematic about it (it's certainly verifiable). I think we might be in agreement on that? So if some rule technically prohibits it, we might have a good case for applying the WP:Ignore all the rules policy. Broken finger is also currently DYK-eligible and I think it uses the same numbering scheme.[1] HLHJ (talk) 02:07, 14 November 2021 (UTC) [edit: add fulltext url] I don't necessarily agree with the reading of WP:DYKCRIT 3b ( Each fact in the hook must be supported in the article by at least one inline citation to a reliable source [...]) that says that the IP thing needs to be in the article (compare e.g. Template:Did you know nominations/Urine deflector, which similarly took some creative licence in how the proposed hooks were phrased beyond what was stated in either the article or the cited source), and I agree with HLHJ that WP:IAR would be applicable regardless. As for the hooks themselves, writing "a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone may be described as 88.5.3.2" is a much poorer way of writing the hook (less "hooky") than the converse, i.e. "88.5.3.2 may refer to a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone". TompaDompa (talk) 11:28, 14 November 2021 (UTC) This. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 17:01, 16 November 2021 (UTC) We can't use IP address because the nominator just thought it up "oh, that looks like an IP address". It's not in the source as the nominator admits and therefore is not verifiable. And so what if it does look like an IP address? What does that tell us about broken toes? I like clever or quirky hooks and have written many (if I may say so), but they have to be based on something in the sources otherwise it's things made up one day. Philafrenzy (talk) 10:19, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you for all your comments. This is not the place to ignore all rules. The proposed hook is not supported by the source given in the article. I am inclined to approve ALT1 but it needs checking, unless another hook is proposed. Whispyhistory (talk) 15:11, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Oh dear, this has become contentious. I think the contended question is whether it's acceptable to have verified information not found in the nominated article, but only in another article, linked in the hook. Not as hooky, but for illustration: ALT3 ... that the dot-decimal notation string "88.5.3.2" is not only an an IPv4 address, but also a fracture in the middle of the bone at the tip of the little toe? "IPv4 and IPv6 address formats". www.ibm.com., Hallux proximal phalanx fracture in adults: an overlooked diagnosis I don't think we're debating whether the IP-address-hook statement is verifiable. The statement that "88.5.3.2" (and any number in that format) is a valid IPv4 address is supported by the IP address article and the IPv4 article, and this format is the subject of the Dot-decimal notation article. No-one had bothered to cite those statements in those articles, but since they've been challenged here, I've now cited them. So "88.5.3.2 is both an IP address[1] and a code for a broken toebone[2]" is certainly verifiable, and is now verified on Wikipedia. Any DYK reader should have no trouble verifying that the hook is accurate. Alternatives that do not mention IP addressees are not as hooky, but don't contain more information about broken toes: ALT4 ... that "88.5.3.2" is a toe fracture in the middle of the bone at the tip of the little toe, while a "78.5.3.2" is the parallel broken finger?

HLHJ (talk) 20:22, 14 November 2021 (UTC) [edited to replace the wrong url, copy-paste mistake] Please don't strike the proposed hook as you have done. You certainly don't have consensus to do that. As several people have explained above, the hook is supported by the article and the source. Dr. Vogel (talk) 15:31, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I don't think the reviewer needs consensus Dr Vogel. I agree and have re-struck it. Please work on something else. I am sure you can develop something good, or tweak the Alt1. Philafrenzy (talk) 19:24, 14 November 2021 (UTC) How about ALT2 ... that 88.5.3.2 is one way of describing a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone? Philafrenzy (talk) 19:25, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you Philafrenzy ( a very experienced DYK contributor) for your efforts in helping new editors understand DYK. Your comment higher up about "88.5.3.2" and "ip address" not being in the source is true and I am grateful for your suggested alts. Essentially, the initial and subsequent hooks sound good, but none are in the article or the source. I don't wish for personal comments and don't mind if someone else wishes to take over here. With due respect @DrVogel: and @HLHJ:...You may wish to take this up at Wikipedia talk:Did you know. Whispyhistory (talk) 10:41, 15 November 2021 (UTC) I won't say I wish I hadn't written the article; I hope it's useful enough to make up for the social harm to the project here. I don't think the hostility was intended by anyone; I suspect that it's felt partly due to the ease of mininterpretation in a text-only medium and partly due to human cognitive biases.[2] I certainly did, and do, not intend it. I spent a day's editing trying to resolve the conflict by finding references specifically saying that the two things were in notation X and adding that text to the article, but unfortunately non-inductive descriptions of the notations seem to have been considered so needless that an Internet RFC attempting to formalize them died of disinterest. I did find a source that explicitly defines the IPv4 format, and one that explicitly says that 88.1.2.2 is a specific fracture, and I've cited the latter in the article, but I don't think this helps. It is probably a bit unreasonable to expect a reviewer to do more than apply rules as best they can, and Wikipedia talk:Did you know might indeed be a better forum for a more detailed discussion. I don't really want to take part in one, though (nothing to do with this discussion, prior reasons). I posted because I felt responsible for the conflict and thought I might be able to help. My impression is that I made it worse; my apologies to everyone I've offended. HLHJ (talk) 03:41, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Nobody is offended, but if I may say so I think you are still missing the point. IP addresses have nothing to do with broken toes even if that notation may have a similarity. That's why the sources don't make the comparison and why the IP-based hooks are no good. Any of the other hooks might be fine (I haven't checked the numbers) just without the bit about IP addresses. The whole thing reminds me of unusually shaped vegetables where you may see a carrot shaped like a foot, people who see faces in clouds, and even apophenia. My personal observation that one thing looks a bit like another is not the basis for a hook unless reliable sources make the point too. Philafrenzy (talk) 09:09, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Folks, we are wasting a wonderful hook. Really. IP addresses have nothing to do with broken toes even if that notation may have a similarity and that is the whole point of making good hooks. They are supposed to be short, punchy, catchy, and likely to draw the readers in to wanting to read the article – as long as they don't misstate the article content. And one of the best recipes to make a hook good is to make it sound counterintuitive With any other option but the original, we are bound to receive another hook frequented by maybe a few hundred visitors. I would propose something to the tune of in some contexts, 88.5.3.2 might not mean an IP address but a broken bone in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone? so that no one claims here that we somehow delegitimise the IP address but at the same time so that we preserve the core of the hook. As for the claims that because the hook is not cited in the IP part, it can't be there - please don't be that pedantic. In our today's world of informatics we may assume that people who visit Wikipedia more or less imagine what IP addresses are, and may more or less imagine how they look like (in the worst case they will visit the article for details). The other part is cited. I see no problem with the original. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 17:01, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Szmenderowiecki I admit that I'm not very familiar with the topic, and the above discussion was confusing, but is the "this isn't an IP address" claim actually in the source? Because if it's not, then no matter how good the hook proposal is, it can't be used in a hook since hook facts need to be based on a reference. Also, I'm pretty sure that assumptions don't count as sources. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:31, 17 November 2021 (UTC) What I was leading is that we don't need to cite that the sky is blue, or that we have five fingers; or that there exist IP addresses for that matter. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 11:08, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Given that these IP number hooks aren't working out so far, I wonder if some other hooks unrelated to that could be proposed here. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 02:11, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Comment only If we accept the first hook we will end up with thousands of hits, some quiet smiles and some who will continue to believe that DYK broke the rules. We're allowed to. This is not a massive occasion where we can save the whole project by breaking the rules. Its a trivial example of what some (not all) think may be a breach in the rules, with a small, but amusing, advantage. So I'm not asking the defenders of the rules to admit that this is not a breech ... I am suggesting that they might just concede that the harm done by allowing this hook might not offend anyone ... and it might please a few thousand. Victuallers (talk) 15:28, 20 November 2021 (UTC) We don't need to break the rules. The observation that the notation looks a bit like an IP address is trivial and completely unrelated to broken toes. There are already perfectly good hooks above that work better. Nobody is saying don't use the numbers, just strike the bit about IP addresses. The originally proposed hook is not the work of comic genius and cleverness that some seem to think it is. Philafrenzy (talk) 21:58, 20 November 2021 (UTC) The main issue here is that it's one of the core rules of DYK that hook facts must be mentioned in the article, ideally explicitly or at least implied by supporting information. The thing is that at the moment, IP addresses are not mentioned anywhere in the article, so the hooks using the IP address angle would be ineligible according to that criterion anyway. Even April Fools hooks, which tend to be misleading, are still generally based on hook facts that are mentioned in the respective articles. So if we can't even grant IAR exemptions for that criterion for AFD hooks, the one day of the year where our hooks tend to follow the rules most loosely, I can't see why such a request should be granted here.

Nominated by Victuallers (talk) at 16:21, 6 November 2021 (UTC). Article is new enough. Two correct writers are credited. The article is fully referenced. No copyvio detected. There is a bit of biased POV pushing in Wikipedia voice: "most vulnerable to climate change". This will be something our subject is saying no doubt. And this idea is also reflected in the hook with "endangered". The hook content is referenced and confirmed by the Guardian, apart from the "endangered" bit, which opinion is attributed to Tina Stege. So I suggest that "endangered" is taken out of the hook, or it is reworded so it is clear she is saying that. Hook alt1 is unsuitable as it does not link the article and I cannot tell what it is trying to say in relation to the subject. I can confirm image is CC-BY-3.0 as derived from the video with CC-BY-3.0 license. However I would suggest that a different image is selected from the video, perhaps near the end where the microphone is not obscuring her chin. QPQ is done.

There is a factual error, as the article states she was interred in Keokuk, Illinois, but the source says she died in Chicago, Illinois and was interred in Keokuk, Iowa. I am assuming good faith for a few references I cannot access (for example, ref 15 - The National Humane Review), which for me gives a landing page for the document, instead of an inside view). Otherwise, everything is properly sourced and there are no copyvio or close paraphrasing concerns (Earwig cites 3 potential problems, but they are not an issue here.) QPQ not required. Regarding the hooks, ALT0 is incorrect as stated, as it reads as if the study was conducted in the early 1900s by Meigs Crowder, whereas she published it in 1917 based on studies from that period. It'll need minor alteration. ALT1 is fine and sourced. I would prefer to promote an amended ALT0. A minor quibble, though not an issue for DYK: please add page numbers for cited sources.

Drive-by comment. Isn't the holding of Downtown Eatery that the plaintiff was employed by a consortium of corporate entities including the named defendant? See Downtown Eatery (1993) Ltd v Ontario, 2001 CanLII 8538 (Ont CA) at para 40: "we conclude that Alouche's employer in June 1993 when he was wrongfully dismissed was all of Twin Peaks, The Landing Strip, Downtown Eatery and Best Beaver". And Mohamed F Khimji & Jon Viner, "Oppression — Reducing Canadian Corporate Law to a Muddy Default", 2016 47-1 Ottawa Law Review 123, 2016 CanLIIDocs 87 at page 173: "… in Downtown Eatery, the applicant, Alouche, successfully obtained judgment for wrongful dismissal against his employer corporation, Best Beaver" (emphasis added in both cases). AleatoryPonderings (???) (!!!) 01:52, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @AleatoryPonderings: Yes, but note that this court case is the "leading case with respect to the issue of common employers", establishing a precedent in Canadian law. At the time the lawsuit was filed, this was not the case, and in fact the trial judge ruled against Alouche (see last paragraph of background section); it was only after the case was brought to the Court of Appeal for Ontario that the "common employer doctrine" was established, and it became entrenched when leave to appeal the decision at the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed. Mindmatrix 15:11, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Ah, so the idea behind the hook is that, since Downtown Eatery changed the law on common employers, before Downtown Eatery Best Beaver would not have been Alouche's employer? That makes more sense. AleatoryPonderings (???) (!!!) 15:20, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: I'm going to inspect this again... Mindmatrix 15:18, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @AleatoryPonderings: Alright, so to ensure everything is correct, the following timeline occurred: Alouche was hired to be manager at For Your Eyes Only (owned by Grad and Grosman), and began work on 29 December 1992 Alouche was sent a Notice of Discipline in May 1993, and was fired on 15 June 1993 In October 1993, Alouche filed action for wrongful dismissal against Best Beaver Management Inc., as that was the source of his paycheques Best Beaver ceased operations in mid-1996, and all assets distributed to other companies owned by Grad and Grosman The trial resolved in favour of Alouche Best Beaver did not pay out the judgement (all its assets had been redistributed) Sherriffs were dispatched to For Your Eyes Only, where they seized $1,855 Downtown Eatery filed claim against Alouche, stating the cash belonged to it Alouche defended, and counterclaimed against Grad, Grosman, and all companies they controlled on the grounds of common employer doctrine, the oppression remedy of the Ontario Business Corporations Act, and fraudulent conveyance the judge in the second trial (at Ontario Superior Court of Justice) ruled against Alouche the case was brought to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, where the previous ruling was overturned in 2001 in January 2002, an application for leave to appeal the decision at the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed So, the common employer doctrine was part of the second trial as a counterclaim to the suit filed by Downtown Eatery. I just wanted to ensure this satisfies your concerns. Mindmatrix 18:25, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks for this incredibly thorough response. My concern is maybe philosophical or definitional. If I say that company A employs person B, that has an ordinary meaning and a legal meaning. It is probably right that Best Beaver did not employ Alouche in the ordinary sense of "employ", because Best Beaver was a "paymaster" and not the name on the front of the building where he went to work. My reading of the case itself is that, before Downtown Eatery, it was at best indeterminate as a legal matter whether Best Beaver, alone or in combination with its affiliate companies, employed Alouche. After Downtown Eatery, it was established—as a matter of legal meaning, but not necessarily ordinary meaning—that Best Beaver was his employer, or part of his employer, or something like that. The reason I brought this up is that it's not clear how one could verify the claim that "Best Beaver was not Alouche's employer", because that claim might be true as a matter of ordinary meaning but the only authoritative legal ruling we have on this (namely, Downtown Eatery) holds that the claim is false. In any event, I'll leave this to the eventual reviewer to sort out. I find my brain twisting into knots. AleatoryPonderings (???)

Interesting: N - see below Other problems: N - see below QPQ: None required. Overall: Hello, Mungo and welcome to DYK! Review as follows: The article is new enough, long enough and neutral. However, it includes a WP:IMDB source and I am unsure about the reliability of several other sources, including Film Ink, Queer Media Matters, Antaeus.org, Fern TV, Addicted to Horror Movies, Dan's Papers, Go Mag, Three Women in a Box and North Coast Rep. To add to that, the YouTube link does not appear to be uploaded by an official channel, making it unreliable. Additionally, per MOS:FILMCAST uncredited roles need a source. the copyvio checker showed up a 50%+ similarity with a source, which may suggest over quotation. On top of that, the subject has unclear notability. I'm unsure which roles are significant and The House on Pine Street appears to have a questionable notability. None of her awards seem significant and I'm not seeing any significant coverage from reliable, independent sources. ALT0 isn't very interesting given the festival is not significant enough to have an article.

Let me know if you find it sufficient or if you want more before considering the article a suitable "start" class. Thanks! ~ Pbritti (talk) 03:20, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks for cooperating! Moving on, the article was created from a redir and nominated in time and is neutral, although I'm requesting a second opinion on the sourcing. The article seems to be plagiarism free, and a QPQ has been done. As for the hook, I'm not sure it quite checks out—is the church expected to break away? Because the article just says that a vote is planned and expected. Once we clear those two up, we're good to go. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 02:41, 21 November 2021 (UTC) @Theleekycauldron: Not entirely sure what the concern on the sourcing is; there are multiple reputable sources.

Please let me know if I can do anything else for you, even if you're passing off this particular review. Thanks! ~ Pbritti (talk) 05:10, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Isn't there a difference between "planned" (alt1) and "expected" (alt0)? planned implies it may or may not happen, expected is like forecasting—at least, that's how i read it. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 05:19, 21 November 2021 (UTC) @Theleekycauldron: Merriam-Webster considers them definitionally synonymous terms (see definition 2).

Source: 1 and 2 Comment: This is the first time I’ve ever made a DYK here, so here goes. I personally find this fact interesting because it highlights how the advent of YouTube, and internet fame in general, has allowed people to use their voice to reach people in positions of high influence, bringing hidden ideas to light and advocating for change. While this specific example falls under a video game/pop-culture category, and may not fit Wikipedia’s desire for academic material, I feel that this is interesting enough to share, as it’s one the gaming community can relate to, like with other social media trends such as #FreeSmash and "Rerelease Mother 3." As for the article itself, all of the citations should be reliable enough; they’re all from third-party/secondary source outlets and there isn’t any BLP violation to be found here. One concern I have is criteria #3 - “Each fact in the hook must be supported in the article by at least one inline citation to a reliable source, appearing no later than the end of the sentence(s) offering that fact. Citations at the end of the paragraph are not sufficient.” While the hook is sourced in the article, the refs are at the end of the section rather than per each sentence. I can fix that however.

Err on the side of caution, and when in doubt, suggest an ALT hook." Could we go with something else? Ritchie333 (talk) (cont) 18:41, 16 November 2021 (UTC) He's a scouser. He'll fucking love it, they'll be feting him in the pubs and clubs of New Brighton as we speak. The point here is to get this lesser-known heroic guy the DYK, not focus on the scuzzball that started it, you know. I mean, something like Did you know that a bomb has just gone off outside a Liverpool hospital is so anodyne it defeats the object of DYK. People want to hear about this guy, not the perp or the police. By the way, as the philosopher Milton Jones once asked on a connected subject, "If an Earl gets an OBE, does he become an Earlobe?"  :) ——Serial 20:03, 16 November 2021 (UTC) How about ALT2 : ... that the taxi driver injured in the Liverpool Women's Hospital bombing was commended by the Mayor of Liverpool and the Prime Minister for his bravery?

Newness requirement satisfied by 5x expansion on 11/15 from < 600 to > 3000 characters. Articles also long enough and compliant with core policies on citations and neutrality. The hook is in-line sourced. Photo has appropriate license. QPQ is done. There are, however, two problems: (1) There is some significant overlap with this source. To start, the following sentence is taken from the source without use of quotation marks and with no effort to paraphrase rather than use the precise words: "Local advocacy led to the establishment of Bridle Trails as a state park in 1932." Further, this sentence also strikes me as too closely drawn from the same source: "Initial park development dates to 1933 when Civil Works Administration employees and federal relief workers were employed in state parks as part of the New Deal program. Further work included burning logging debris, clearing brush and building trails and fences." Work needs to be done to put the material into your own words. (2) The hook strikes me as boring in that it states an obvious point. Horses having the right of way on this trail is not unique or special. On trails that are shared by humans and horses, it is the general rule that horses have the right of way. See here ("In general, horses always have the right of way, followed by hikers, then by bikers."). See also here ("For safety reasons, if you come across a horse and rider on any trail they always have right of way. Hikers and bike riders all yield to horses.")

For one, the quote is not actually "could have been made by aliens" so, considering this is all about misquotation, we should either use the actual quote or clarify that it is a misquotation. Then "as though it was a real announcement" implies that it was actually, I don't know, a fake announcement? A parody?

Graham87 09:41, 18 November 2021 (UTC) @Gerda Arendt: Thank you for the review. Diamonds were often cut in cabochon style in the 19th century and earlier. This one was cut with a flat bottom like all cabochons, and when viewed from above, it was a large oval, about 1.5 inches long. Modern cabochons usually have a smoothly rounded surface; this one was lightly faceted but the facets don't show on the sculpture. So it looks like half an egg, I suppose. The Koh-i-Noor is the large oval at the bottom of the picture. We have no specific citation for artistic licence - that is just a conclusion that we can probably make, since we have no evidence that Victoria ever had it set in a necklace. Therefore I cannot use "artistic licence" in a hook or in the article. I'll have a go at a hook using a full-length Victoria, and another hook using the Warrior and Wounded Youth sculpture.

There is over-linking in the hook. Copyvio seems fine (ignoring the 90% violation, which is a website which copies Wikipedia) QPQ not required. But, the 'Background' section is entirely copied from 2021 United States Electoral College vote count. (1) It is done without attribution, see Wikipedia:Copying within Wikipedia (2) Per WP:DYKCRIT 1b, copied content does not count while calculating characters.

I'm quite confident a more expanded article would be a more attractive thing to present to the reader (and there would be plenty of more interesting hooks. Did you know that a recently discovered 1692 libretto of an actual Abendmusik bears similarities to Wacht! Euch zum Streit?[1][2]. Or that the Abendmusiken were actually presented right after Vespers?[3] Vespers, which themselves lasted two or three hours, in addition to a further three or four hour Hauptgottesdienst in the morning?[4][5] That might be one of the reasons why the audience was reported to be so disorderly, to the point that the town watch had to be hired to maintain a semblance of order.[6] That, and a lot more, which would surely allow to take this to DYK at a later time, after having greatly expanded this. Or at least, it's my opinion that taking the sole opportunity for DYK now would be a waste when it can be done when the article is expanded and made into something significantly more attractive and informative.

Further information: Official supplementary guidelines and unofficial guide  Warning: You are not logged in. Please create an account or log in to proceed. Alternatively, you may leave a message at the bottom of the DYK project talk page with the article you would like to nominate and the hook you would like to propose.  Warning: The helper script only works on desktop. Please switch to desktop view to continue. Install the DYK helper script by adding the line {{subst:lusc|User:SD0001/DYK-helper.js}} to your common.js page. Go back to the article, and choose the "DYK" option from the "More" menu (see image). Fill in the form and submit it. Check back periodically to address comments or concerns from the reviewer (it may take several weeks). Manual instructions[edit] Create a subpage for your new DYK suggestion and then list the page below under the date the article was created or the expansion began or it became a good article (not the date you submit it here), with the newest dates at the bottom. Any registered user may nominate a DYK suggestion (if you are not a registered user, please leave a message at the bottom of the DYK project talk page with the details of the article you would like to nominate and the hook you would like to propose); self-nominations are permitted and encouraged. Thanks for participating and please remember to check back for comments on your nomination (consider watchlisting your nomination page). Read these instructions completely before proceeding. For simplified instructions, see User:Rjanag/Quick DYK 2. I. Create the nomination subpage. Enter the article title in the box below and click the button. (To nominate multiple articles together, enter any or all of the article titles.) You will then be taken to a preloaded nomination page. II. Write the nomination. On the nomination page, fill in the relevant information. See Template:NewDYKnomination and {{NewDYKnomination/guide}} for further information. Not every line of the template needs to be filled in. For instance, if you are not nominating an image to appear with your hook, there is no need to fill in the image-related lines. Add an edit summary e.g. "Nominating YOUR ARTICLE TITLE for DYK" and click Publish page. Make sure the nomination page is on your watchlist, so you can follow the review discussion. III. Post at Template talk:Did you know. In the current nominations section find the subsection for the date on which the article was created or on which expansion began (or, if a new Good Article, the date on which it became a GA), not the date on which you make the nomination. At the top of that subsection (before other nominations already there, but below the section head and hidden comment) add {{Did you know nominations/YOUR ARTICLE TITLE}}. Add an edit summary e.g. "Nominating YOUR ARTICLE TITLE for DYK" and click Publish page. Frequently asked questions[edit] How do I write an interesting hook? Successful hooks tend to have several traits. Most importantly, they share a surprising or intriguing fact. They give readers enough context to understand the hook, but leave enough out to make them want to learn more. They are written for a general audience who has no prior knowledge of or interest in the topic area. Lastly, they are concise, and do not attempt to cover multiple facts or present information about the subject beyond what's needed to understand the hook. When will my nomination be reviewed? This page is often backlogged. As long as your submission is still on the page, it will stay there until an editor reviews it. Since editors are encouraged to review the oldest submissions first, it may take several weeks until your submission is reviewed. In the meantime, please consider reviewing another submission (not your own) to help reduce the backlog (see instructions below). Where is my hook? If you can't find the nomination you submitted to this nominations page, it may have been approved and is on the approved nominations page waiting to be promoted. It could also have been added to one of the prep areas, promoted from prep to a queue, or is on the main page. If the nominated hook is in none of those places, then the nomination has probably been rejected. Such a rejection usually only occurs if it was at least a couple of weeks old and had unresolved issues for which any discussion had gone stale. If you think your nomination was unfairly rejected, you can query this on the DYK discussion page, but as a general rule such nominations will only be restored in exceptional circumstances. Instructions for reviewers[edit] Main page: Wikipedia:Did you know/Reviewing guide Any editor who was not involved in writing/expanding or nominating an article may review it by checking to see that the article meets all the DYK criteria (long enough, new enough, no serious editorial or content issues) and the hook is cited. Editors may also alter the suggested hook to improve it, suggest new hooks, or even lend a hand and make edits to the article to which the hook applies so that the hook is supported and accurate. For a more detailed discussion of the DYK rules and review process see the supplementary guidelines and the WP:Did you know/Reviewing guide. To post a comment or review on a DYK nomination, follow the steps outlined below: Look through this page, Template talk:Did you know, to find a nomination you would like to comment on. Click the "Review or comment" link at the top of the nomination. You will be taken to the nomination subpage. The top of the page includes a list of the DYK criteria. Check the article to ensure it meets all the relevant criteria. To indicate the result of the review (i.e., whether the nomination passes, fails, or needs some minor changes), leave a signed comment on the page. Please begin with one of the 5 review symbols that appear at the top of the edit screen, and then indicate all aspects of the article that you have reviewed; your comment should look something like the following: Article length and age are fine, no copyvio or plagiarism concerns, reliable sources are used. But the hook needs to be shortened. If you are the first person to comment on the nomination, there will be a line :* <!-- REPLACE THIS LINE TO WRITE FIRST COMMENT, KEEPING  :* --> showing you where you should put the comment. Save the page. If there is any problem or concern about a nomination, please consider notifying the nominator by placing {{subst:DYKproblem|Article|header=yes|sig=yes}} on the nominator's talk page. Instructions for project members[edit] How to promote an accepted hook[edit] At-a-glance instructions on how to promote an approved hook to a Prep area See Wikipedia:Did you know/Preparation areas for details on verifying a hook's acceptability. Promoters should not promote their own nomination or their own review When promoting hooks intended for a particular date, keep in mind that when the number of available approved nominations exceeds 120 we switch to two sets per day, and when that number drops below 60 we return to one set per day. Check list for nomination review completeness 1) Select a hook from the approved nominations page that has one of these ticks at the bottom post: . 2) Check to make sure basic review requirements were completed. a. Any outstanding issue following needs to be addressed before promoting. 3) Check the article history for any substantive changes since it was nominated or reviewed. 4) Images for the lead slot must be freely licensed. Fair-use images are not permitted. Images loaded on Commons that appear on the Main Page are automatically protected by KrinkleBot. 5) Hook must be stated in both the article and source (which must be cited at the end of the article sentence where stated). 6) Hook should make sense grammatically. 7) Try to vary subject matters within each prep area. 8) Try to select a funny, quirky or otherwise upbeat hook for the last or bottom hook in the set. Steps to add a hook to prep In one tab, open the nomination page of the hook you want to promote. In a second tab, open the prep set you intend to add the hook to. 1) For hooks held for specific dates, refer to "Local update times" section on DYK Queue. a. Completed Prep area number sets will be promoted by an administrator to corresponding Queue number. 2) Copy and paste the hook into a chosen slot. a. Make sure there's a space between ... and that, and a ? at the end. b. Check that there's a bold link to the article. 3) If it's the lead (first) hook, paste the image where indicated at the top of the template. 4) Copy and paste ALL the credit information (the {{DYKmake}} and {{DYKnom}} templates) at the bottom 5) Check your work in the prep's Preview mode. a. At the bottom under "Credits", to the right of each article should have the link "View nom subpage" ; if not, a subpage parameter will need to be added to the DYKmake. 6) Save the Prep page. Closing the DYK nomination page At the upper left Change {{DYKsubpage to {{subst:DYKsubpage Change |passed= to |passed=yes At the bottom Just above the line containing }}<!--Please do not write below this line or remove this line. Place comments above this line.--> insert a new, separate line containing one of the following: To [[T:DYK/P1|Prep 1]] To [[T:DYK/P2|Prep 2]] To [[T:DYK/P3|Prep 3]] To [[T:DYK/P4|Prep 4]] To [[T:DYK/P5|Prep 5]] To [[T:DYK/P6|Prep 6]] To [[T:DYK/P7|Prep 7]] Also paste the same thing into the edit summary. Check in Preview mode. Make sure everything is against a pale blue background (nothing outside) and there are no stray characters, like }}, at the top or bottom. Save. For more information, please see T:TDYK#How to promote an accepted hook. Handy copy sources: To [[T:DYK/P1|Prep 1]] To [[T:DYK/P2|Prep 2]] To [[T:DYK/P3|Prep 3]] To [[T:DYK/P4|Prep 4]] To [[T:DYK/P5|Prep 5]] To [[T:DYK/P6|Prep 6]] To [[T:DYK/P7|Prep 7]] How to remove a rejected hook[edit] Open the DYK nomination subpage of the hook you would like to remove. (It's best to wait several days after a reviewer has rejected the hook, just in case someone contests or the article undergoes a large change.) In the window where the DYK nomination subpage is open, replace the line {{DYKsubpage with {{subst:DYKsubpage, and replace |passed= with |passed=no. Then save the page. This has the effect of wrapping up the discussion on the DYK nomination subpage in a blue archive box and stating that the nomination was unsuccessful, as well as adding the nomination to a category for archival purposes. How to remove a hook from the prep areas or queue[edit] Edit the prep area or queue where the hook is and remove the hook and the credits associated with it. Go to the hook's nomination subpage (there should have been a link to it in the credits section). View the edit history for that page Go back to the last version before the edit where the hook was promoted, and revert to that version to make the nomination active again. Add a new icon on the nomination subpage to cancel the previous tick and leave a comment after it explaining that the hook was removed from the prep area or queue, and why, so that later reviewers are aware of this issue. Add a transclusion of the template back to this page so that reviewers can see it. It goes under the date that it was first created/expanded/listed as a GA. You may need to add back the day header for that date if it had been removed from this page. If you removed the hook from a queue, it is best to either replace it with another hook from one of the prep areas, or to leave a message at WT:DYK asking someone else to do so. How to move a nomination subpage to a new name[edit] Don't; it should not ever be necessary, and will break some links which will later need to be repaired. Even if you change the title of the article, you don't need to move the nomination page. Nominations[edit] Older nominations[edit] Articles created/expanded on September 2[edit] Articles created/expanded on September 27[edit] Roman campaigns in Germania (12 BC – AD 16) ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that the Romans won a series of campaigns against the Germanic tribes following the disaster at Teutoburg, but decided to leave Germany because its land was not considered valuable? Source: Wells (2003), The Battle That Stopped Rome, pp. 206–7 Improved to Good Article status by SpartaN (talk). Self-nominated at 03:34, 29 September 2021 (UTC). General eligibility: New Enough: Y Long Enough: Y Other problems: Y Policy compliance: Adequate sourcing: Y Neutral: Y Free of copyright violations, plagiarism, and close paraphrasing: Y Other problems: Y Hook eligibility: Cited: N - Source is offline but happy to AGF. However, in the article the statement “they considered German lands too poor for annexation” is sourced to p.204 of Wells. pp.206-7 referred to above is used to support that they that “it was too costly in economic and military resources” to go into in Germany. I guess either way the hook is sourced but could you clarify the exact sourcing of the hook. Interesting: Y QPQ: None required. Overall: Interesting thorough article, well-written with good quality sourcing. Earwig shows no issues. Just a minor query around the hook sourcing but otherwise will be good to go. DeCausa (talk) 08:23, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @DeCausa: I found the web link that (for me) shows a preview if you're able to see it: https://books.google.com/books?id=mc30CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA206&lpg=PA206 SpartaN (talk) 10:07, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @SpartaN: Thanks for providing the link. It’s prompted a couple of thoughts for me. Firstly, Wells doesn’t seem to be saying the reason for the withdrawal is definitively known (“… the reasons for these decisions must have lain…”) i.e he’s making an assumption, however well founded. The hook is more definite than Wells is. Secondly, Wells’ emphasis is on the strength of the resistance being behind the reason - the poor value of the territory makes it “not worth it” because of the strength of the resistance. That’s not quite the same as just saying the land wasn’t valuable. (I notice the text you used in the article on this reflects that effort/value ratio issue.) To fix both points would you be prepared to consider an ALT1 which after “…Teutoburg” continues something along the lines of “…likely decided to leave Germany because the military effort was out of proportion to the territory’s value?” although there may need to be some trimming to get it into the 200 character limit. DeCausa (talk) 11:12, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @SpartaN and DeCausa: It's been over a month since the last comments here, have there been any updates? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:31, 13 November 2021 (UTC) From my point of view I’m waiting for SpartaN’s reply to my last post here. But I notice they haven’t edited Wikipedia since then, over a month ago. So I’m not quite sure what can be done. DeCausa (talk) 08:17, 13 November 2021 (UTC) I see. Given that there's really only one issue holding the nomination back, would anyone be willing to adopt this in case SpartaN doesn't return? It would be a shame if the nomination failed at this point. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 06:35, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I’m not sure what exactly are the DYK rules on this but, subject to that, options could be (a) I propose an ALT1 hook and someone else signs it off; (b) someone else proposes an ALT1 hook and I sign it off; (c) if anyone disagrees with me on the original hook I’m happy to step away and they sign it off. DeCausa (talk) 11:04, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I've looked at the Wells source and concur that it is saying the withdrawal was more down to the ratio of effort required to potential reward, and have boldly tweaked the copy in the article to reflect this. For what it's worth, I think ALT1 works just fine. firefly ( t · c ) 11:16, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Ok. I’m just going to formalize the ALT1 and let someone else add the tick and sign off: ALT1:... that the Romans won a series of campaigns against the Germanic tribes after the disaster at Teutoburg but likely decided to leave Germany as the effort was out of proportion to the territory’s value? DeCausa (talk) 12:07, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Since the reviewer has proposed a new hook, another editor will be needed to sign this off. I'm not sure though if the section linking in the bold links is allowed, however. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:29, 15 November 2021 (UTC) sorry, I missed that. It’s not even necessary to link to a section of the article so I’ve taken it out of ALT1. DeCausa (talk) 08:21, 15 November 2021 (UTC) As this doesn’t seem to be moving I’m going to give ALT1 the tick as original reviewer. If the DYK regulars think this is out of process because I came up nwith ALT1 then happy for it to be reverted. DeCausa (talk) 22:46, 21 November 2021 (UTC) DeCausa, there is no rush to approve, and your approval of your own hook was indeed out of process. I have reverted SL93's promotion of the nomination to prep, and with any luck a new reviewer will be around soon enough to review your ALT1. (SL93, you're welcome to review it, but that means you cannot also promote it.) I've also struck the original hook due to the issues noted above. BlueMoonset (talk) 04:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) BlueMoonset Sorry for mixing up who approved it. SL93 (talk) 04:26, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I didn't notice the second sentence of the approval...not sure how that happened. Sorry, again. SL93 (talk) 04:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) DeCausa Reading through the article again, your ALT1 hook seems to be mostly verifed in the Aftermath section, but I'm not seeing any indication of it being "likely". SL93 (talk) 21:14, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, that’s true. Where that came from was, in the above discussion with SpartaN on the original hook, they cited Wells in support. Wells says, in relation to Tiberius’ decision to ‘give up’, that “The reason for these decisions must have lain in the Germans’ tough resistance”. I’ve taken that to mean Wells’ was inferring Tiberius’ reasoning without direct evidence (or certainty) of Tiberius’ actual reason. However, you’re right that the way the article is written is more certain. I’m ok striking the “likely” or, possibly it would be better to amend the final sentence of the first paragraph of the Aftermath section to be more reflectve of Wells. DeCausa (talk) 21:48, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I will leave this here for someone else to look at. It would be helpful if the nominator came back. SL93 (talk) 23:21, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Articles created/expanded on October 9[edit] Pankratius Pfeiffer ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that Salvatorian priest Pankratius Pfeiffer saved hundreds of Jews in Rome during the Second World War? Reviewed: 1936 Northeast Flood Created by Ergo Sum (talk). Self-nominated at 17:52, 9 October 2021 (UTC). New article that was created on 9 October 2021? is 3,212 characters and nominated on the same day. No copyvios detected and duplication detector of [1][2][3][4][5] reveal no close paraphrasing issues (AGF PDF docs which can't go through Dup detector). Article is well-sourced. Hook is 103 characters long (under 200 character max.) and is interesting. Refs 4 and 5 (verifying the hook) are reliable sources. QPQ done. Looks good to go! —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:41, 9 October 2021 (UTC) Too many red flags here. If he really saved hundreds of Jews, you would expect plenty of confirmation of this in scholarly sources and him to be recognized by Yad Vashem. I can't count the number of times that I've seen mainstream newspapers print completely false stories about Jews being rescued during the holocaust, so better sources are definitely needed to confirm these extraordinary claims. Thanks Brigade Piron for letting me know about this. (t · c) buidhe 16:51, 10 October 2021 (UTC) I have to admit I'm just a bit perplexed by the argument. Except in fairly uncommon cases of multiple RS that contradict each other, we don't generally recognize any "hierarchy" of reliable sources. Sources are either RS or they are not. So I'm not sure what kind of sources you have in mind as "better" sources. The ones currently cited in the article are all RS, so that should be the end of it. I might add that if you seek some manner of official imprimatur in the vein of Yad Vashem, the City of Rome named a street after him. Your point about why there isn't more extensive coverage of this historical figure is well taken but can easily be attributed to the fact that all manner of historical figures are lost to history, especially those who are notable really for one major event in their life that did not come to light until years later, as is the case here. Indeed, one of the RS in this article describes Pfeiffer as being "lost to history." I'm adding the new review icon here so that we can get at least one more editor's evaluation of this. Ergo Sum 13:32, 16 October 2021 (UTC) There are very few people who actually saved hundreds of Jews during the Holocaust and plenty of hoaxes that were reported as truth by various news organizations—for example Necdet Kent. In other cases, actual rescue did occur but the numbers are greatly exaggerated and repeated uncritically by news organizations, such as Raoul Wallenberg. If the story is true you would expect to see it covered in many more credible sources. There are plenty of cases where a source is reliable for some info but not others. For example, someone's CV is often reliable for "they worked at X organization" but not "they are a world expert in Z". Extraordinary claims require extraordinary sourcing. (t · c) buidhe 21:27, 16 October 2021 (UTC) I should say that I share Buidhe's concerns. I think saying that "all manner of historical figures are lost to history" rather side-steps the sheer volume of historical scholarship on all aspects of the Holocaust. On a more banal note, I think part of the problem is that the sources cited are, essentially, all journalistic sources published by explicitly Catholic or Salvatorian outlets. The specific sources cited for the "saved" claim are Romereports (I am not familiar with this outlet, but the typo in the video does not inspire confidence) and a self-published Salvatorian newsletter. Neither are scholarly sources and both are, again, explicitly confessional in nature. I think WP:BIASED may on point in a highly sensitive issue touching on the wider disputes about Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust. Do we know what the Samerski book says, for example? —Brigade Piron (talk) 08:55, 17 October 2021 (UTC) Buidhe It is true that the sources cover Catholic issues, but only the Salvatorian one is actually published by a Catholic institution. I need not go into how varied Catholic newspapers are in their adherence/faithfulness to the Catholic hierarchy and beliefs (see e.g. National Catholic Reporter versus National Catholic Register). But more direclty, there actually are many scholarly RS that discussion Pfeiffer and his works in Nazi-occupied Rome. You will find them on the other language versions of this article. The problem is that I do not read Italian or German well enough to use them in the article. Coverage is not the issue. It is English language coverage. Ergo Sum 13:48, 17 October 2021 (UTC) @Ergo Sum: perhaps add the word "reportedly" before "saved". I'm inclined to accept in good faith the sources used as reliable – none of them have not been deprecated nor deemed generally unreliable. —Bloom6132 (talk) 16:41, 26 October 2021 (UTC) DYK should not cover unconfirmed reports or rumors so I strongly disagree with that suggestion. As well as assuming sources are reliable if they've never been discussed at WP:RSN, which disregards important parts of WP:RS such as WP:CONTEXTMATTERS. There is no issue with citing sources in Italian or German, but if it's not confirmed that they support the content then it's incorrect to assume that they do. (t · c) buidhe 20:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Bloom6132: I tend to think that statements are either supported by RS and written in wikivoice or they're not accepted at all. For that reason, I shy away from words like "reportedly." I reiterate though that I think it's quite clear there's nothing wrong with the sources currently used. They're all RS, so that should be the end of it. Hence, why I think your initial review was satisfactory. Ergo Sum 23:40, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Ergo Sum: agreed. I'm still of the view that the hook satisfies criteria 3b. Criteria 4 states that "Nominations should be rejected if an inspection reveals that they are not based on reliable sources". That is not the case here. —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) You're still ignoring the principle in RS that context matters, and some sources are reliable for some but not other info. The two of us who actually write on Holocaust related topics have expressed that the sources cited are not reliable for the exceptional claims being made. (t · c) buidhe 23:59, 26 October 2021 (UTC) With all due respect, I am of the opinion that the sources used are reliable for the info in the hook. The fact that you and Brigade Piron write on Holocaust-related topics is irrelevant – it does not confer a veto over hooks pertaining to that subject. By that logic, I should be able to veto baseball or heraldry hooks ... —Bloom6132 (talk) 01:10, 27 October 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: Three of my DYKs promoted (including Coat of arms of the Falkland Islands from August this year) have included the word "reportedly" in the hook, as well as numerous hooks from other editors. Disagree all you want – this is accepted practice at DYK. —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: I'm aware that you have experience writing about Holocaust-related articles and I put value in your assessment as a solid editor. However, I'm quite comfortable in my ability to vet RS, as well, and my confidence in these sources means I must disagree with your opinion here. Experienced editors do disagree at times, and it is my opinion that I think you have gotten this one wrong; doubtless, you think the same for me. I haven't seen any evidence that these are not RS. Therefore, I recommend if Bloom6132 is inclined to do so, to renew their approval of the hook. In the meantime, I'm going to request the input of additional experienced editors on the DYK talk page. Ergo Sum 01:28, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm going to ping @Bamse, Bermicourt, Jmabel, and Anyfile to see if we can find some reliable sources in other languages. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 01:46, 27 October 2021 (UTC) Oops, @AnyFile theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 01:47, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm currently traveling & very busy, so not much help here, I'm afraid. - Jmabel | Talk 01:53, 27 October 2021 (UTC) That said, more or less this same case is made in The Pope's Jews: The Vatican's Secret Plan to Save Jews from the Nazis by Gordon Thomas (not currently cited in the article). - Jmabel | Talk 02:00, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm unclear as to why the cited sources are unreliable: are we assuming that all information emanating from a Roman Catholic source is unreliable? If so what's the logic? In any case there are dozens of book sources in English, German, French and Italian that mention Pfeiffer, the problem is that few are accessible online. One is an entire biography of Pfeiffer "from baker to Vatican diplomat" which would be useful to track down: Willer, Philomena (2005). P. Pankratius Pfeiffer SDS: (1872-1945); vom Bäckergesellen zum Vatikandiplomat. Pub: Josef Fink. Others that mentions Pfeiffer and the Jews in Rome are: Liebhart (1996) Schwangau. Meding (1992), Flucht vor Nürnberg. Sinn (1976), Illegal. Bermicourt (talk) 08:41, 27 October 2021 (UTC) My issue is with the unreliability of journalistic works and popular history, which have in many cases published inaccurate information about rescues of Jews during the Holocaust. If better sources exist, they should be cited instead. An additional question is, do these sources actually support the claim of "hundreds" of Jews rescued by Pfeiffer personally? (t · c) buidhe 08:51, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I've now found sources that cover most of the article. Here are more: Liebhart (1996) Schwangau. Meding (1992), Flucht vor Nürnberg. Sinn (1976), Illegal. Prince Constantine of Bavaria (1952) Der Papst. Layer (1985), Schwäbisches Ehrenbuch - Pfeiffer credited with "saving Rome and other Italian cities including Chieti, Ascoli and Ovieto from destruction and other calamities" _ (1999). Publik-Forum - Pfeiffer the only German to have a street named after him in Rome and who fought to save Roman Jews. _ (1960). Bayerische Frömmigkeit - Pfeiffer described as the "Saviour of Rome and other cities in Italy" Robert Katz has written a number of books - Death in Rome (1967), Black Sabbath (1969), The Battle for Rome (2010) - which all mention Pfeiffer. Bottum and Dalin (2004). The Pius War has this interesting piece: "7. Pancrazio [sic] Pfeiffer. According to Carroll-Abbing, one of the men used by Pius XII to protest the Nazi roundup of Rome's Jews and intervene for persecuted victims was Father Pancrazio Pfeiffer, superior general of the Salvatorian Fathers, who also served as Pius XII' personal liaison to the German military command in Rome. Because Pfeiffer died tragically in an automobile accident toward the end of the war and thus never took part in the postwar analysis of Pius XII's conduct, many historians have overlooked him. But those who knew him or have researched his life have chronicled his collaborative efforts with Pius XII to rescue Jews and others during the war. See the article "Pfeiffer's List" by Robert Graham, 30 Days, June 1994, pp. 42-46. Prince Constantine of Bavaria's book on Pius XII, The Pope (London: Allan Wingate, 1954) [listed above] contains an excellent section on Pfeiffer, whom he describes as an agent for the pope on behalf of the victims of persecution and the fugitives in hiding" (p. 213). At Pfeiffer's death in May 1945, Vatican Radio paid tribute: "He came into contact with the Commander of the German occupying forces [in Rome in 1943-44]. From that day onwards, he placed his religious and spiritual qualities at the service of many who had been arrested or already condemned to death. He helped countless people in this way, and saved their lives, among them many Jews and other Italian personages. He championed..." In short there seems to be book evidence for virtually everything stated in the article apart from the specific details of the two incidents where 249 or 400 Jews were rescued. Based on my initial searches my expectation is that those incidents are likely to be recorded in the literature - we just need to be able to access more of the sources. Meanwhile there is no harm in pausing to use some of the above sources, plus those I've added to the Further reading section of the article in order to reinforce the existing references and then review where we are. Bermicourt (talk) 08:41, 27 October 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: thoughts? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 07:09, 4 November 2021 (UTC) I don't think the article currently meets DYK requirements. For example, Salvatorians USA Province is not independent of the article subject and therefore is not reliable for self-serving assertions such as "he saved many Jews in Rome from persecution and ultimately death" or "Every day, Pfeiffer visited the Regina Coeli prison and another prison on Via Tasso, where he would often return with freed prisoners who had been sentenced to death." (t · c) buidhe 08:27, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: would you still object if the article instead relied on the sources found by Bermicourt? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 04:58, 5 November 2021 (UTC) Depends, the Samerski source looks reliable to me but the book published by "Österreichische Provinz der Salvatorianer" has the same issue of close connection to the article subject. (t · c) buidhe 06:27, 5 November 2021 (UTC) All right. @Ergo Sum: I'm not going to promote the nomination without consensus to move forward, so if you want to try and rework the article's sourcing to approval, that can work.

This slipped my mind completely this weekend. I will deal with this tonight. Ergo Sum 15:45, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I have added several inline citations to the article, which refer to sources that were (very helpfully) added by Bermicourt. These sources support several of the very specific claims in the article, as well as the general thrust of the article which is in dispute here, namely that Pfeiffer was a liaison and in that capacity saved many Jews and others from the Nazis. In light of these reliable sources supporting the general claims, I think any concern about the pre-existing ones describing some of his more specific actions is ameliorated. There is a trove of additional sources in the Further Reading section that additionally describe in much greater detail Pfeiffer's actions but they are either in a foreign language which I do not adequately read to make use of as citations or are offline. All being said, I think there is now ample sourcing to back up the article's claims. Ergo Sum 05:49, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks, Ergo Sum—@Buidhe:, if this sourcing is up to your standards, we can move ahead. If not, we're probably going back to WT:DYK and asking for more eyes. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 05:52, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Hi, I've flagged the specific content in the article that supports the hook as needing a better source. There are other active cleanup tags on the article as well. However, I think there's sufficient sourcing for a modified version of the hook without the words "hundreds of". (t · c) buidhe 06:06, 17 November 2021 (UTC) We could cite "countless" using the ref above instead of "hundreds of". Bermicourt (talk) 08:33, 17 November 2021 (UTC) According to the source it's what Vatican Radio said about him after his death. DYK is not for eulogies imo. (t · c) buidhe 08:37, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I'm not following—is the source unreliable because it's after his death? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 08:40, 17 November 2021 (UTC) No, it's because it's Catholic presumably... We could always add "according to Vatican Radio..." But better still, we just need to cite the exact text from one of the many non-Catholic book sources and the problem will be solved. Bermicourt (talk) 08:46, 17 November 2021 (UTC) And yet another source: O'Reilly (2001) in Forgotten Battles: Italy's War of Liberation 1943-45 states that "the Vatican was able to assist many of Rome's Jews and others sought by the Germans through Father Pancrazio Pfeiffer's intervention with the Germans... His work was recounted by Robert Graham who has written extensively on the Vatican's role in World War II." Bermicourt (talk) 09:01, 17 November 2021 (UTC) And another: Bartley (2016) in Catholics Confronting Hitler states that "Father Pancrace [sic] Pfeiffer, a German priest and the superior general of the Salvatorian Order, was the pope's liaison with the German military. Several hundred hostages, including some under sentence of death, owed their release to the efficacious intervention of Father Pfeiffer." I don't know why I'm doing this - you can look up the references yourselves instead of opining and speculating from the sidelines in the classic Wikipedia way. :) Bermicourt (talk) 09:08, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @Bermicourt: Since it seems you have access to several sources that I do not (probably just requires further digging), would you want to add them as inline citations with page numbers, especially to support the proposition regarding hundreds of people saved?

I'd be in favor instead of the hook being split into two separate proposals: one hook about the fact that she was an internet celebrity who grew up in a place without tap water, and a separate hook about her going viral for making hamburgers. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:23, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Full review needed, which can also address the issue of the borderline ALT1 hook. BlueMoonset (talk) 04:23, 5 November 2021 (UTC) As far as I can tell the article meets DYK requirements, and a QPQ has been done. Earwigs finds a close match with Coda Media, but that's only because it was the source for quotes in the article, and all of them are properly referenced. I find the first hook hard to believe given China's international standing, and in any case as brought up by Bowlhover may be inaccurate anyway. As for the second hook, as I mentioned before it's ineligible as it's exactly 200 characters long, and per WP:DYK hooks that are at or shorter than 200 characters may be rejected per reviewer's discretion. Both ALT0 and ALT1 have struck: I am repeating my earlier suggestion that ALT1 instead be split into two separate hooks. As this is a China-related article and there appear to be some political discussion in the article, I'd also like to ask for a second opinion from someone more knowledgeable about China-related articles if the article doesn't fall afoul of relevant guidelines. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 13:12, 6 November 2021 (UTC) From Wikipedia:Did you know#The hook: The hook should be concise: no more than about 200 characters (including spaces and the question mark, but not including the ..., the space immediately following the ..., or any (pictured)). While 200 is a hard limit, hooks near or at this limit may still be rejected at the discretion of reviewers and administrators. This tool can be used for counting words. The guideline says that "200 is a hard limit", so it is not true that the 200-character ALT1 hook is "ineligible" or "simply too long". No reason has been given for rejecting a 200-character hook "at the discretion of reviewers". Here are two additional hooks based on the suggestion: ALT2: ... that Dianxi Xiaoge, who grew up in a remote Yunnan mountain without running water, is an Internet celebrity with roughly 16 million subscribers on all her platforms? ALT3: ... Dianxi Xiaoge went viral in China and internationally after making hamburgers for her grandparents who had never eaten them before? Cunard (talk) 07:48, 7 November 2021 (UTC) Well for one thing, the original was very difficult to read and seemed to combine too many facts into one hook. Usually DYK prefers simpler hooks whenever possible. In any case, I think ALT3 is the best hook here and the nomination is otherwise good to go, I'd just like to hear a second opinion from another editor on the article tone given that I'm a bit uncomfortable doing a solo review here given the "Commentary" section delves into some political matters. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:36, 7 November 2021 (UTC) On second thought, I have some concerns regarding the length of the article. Isn't it rather detailed for an internet celebrity's page? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 11:10, 7 November 2021 (UTC) That the article is "rather detailed for an internet celebrity's page" should not be a concern. The sources provided substantial analysis of her and her work, and this article reflects those sources. Other detailed articles for Internet celebrities include PewDiePie and MrBeast.

Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:57, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I don't think we need Gatoclass to restate themself. Here's what they said at WT:DYK: The article doesn't use the phrase "one of only three Chinese influencers to gain international influence", so I'm not sure where you got that, but it does say she is one of only three "Chinese Internet celebrities who have reached international prominence", and the problem with that claim is that it's sourced to an article that is two years old and therefore not up-to-date. With regard to the overall length, I would agree that it is overly detailed and could use a trim. I'm not sure this is relevant to DYK however, as "overly detailed" is not one of our criteria. What I would say is that the level of detail does raise the chances of close paraphrasing so the article would need to be carefully checked for that. Anybody else with an opinion on this article?

My reasoning here is that if the hook were read as plaintext, without any bolding or linking, it would be read as pretty much only interesting as it concerns the plot. The hook should concern Smit's life; if it concerns her work as an actress, only stating her role and not anything about production doesn't make the hook out-of-universe. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 21:28, 17 November 2021 (UTC) theleekycauldron, I was taking a look at the ALT1 hook and its sources, and the second Biography sentence is basically copied from Esquire—the Google translate version, at any rate. That's a problem. Another problem is that the source doesn't actually say that she was working as a hotel receptionist when she got the call, just that it was "one of these jobs", referring back to the four in the previous sentence, none of which were hotel receptionist. The article also needs a bit of copyediting. I don't think that either of the plot-based hooks should be used, and as Drmies notes, "first film" is not accurate, since it's Cross the Line that's in the source, which appears to be her fifth film. We could only use "first feature film" if the previous four in her filmography were all short films (which would need to be clearly sourced). Perhaps an angle for the information in ALT1 would be to say she was working in whatever job it was when she was cast in Cross the Line, for which she was nominated as best new actress in the Goya Awards. BlueMoonset (talk) 02:31, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Here’s an article that states she was working as a receptionist two years before she was hired to work on Parallel Mothers:[6] Does it appear reliable? Thriley (talk) 05:38, 20 November 2021 (UTC) I don't see a reason to doubt the source. However, it isn't sufficient to support the "when she was called" hook claim, just that she was a hotel receptionist two years before the article was written (and possibly two years and a number of months, since you can't assume it's exactly two years). BlueMoonset (talk) 17:14, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Perhaps the hook should include all her various jobs before her Almodovar role? Thriley (talk) 01:47, 23 November 2021 (UTC) ALT3 “before starring in the Pedro Almodóvar film Parallel Mothers, Milena Smit worked as a model, waitress, shop assistant, babysitter, teleoperator, subway information assistant, and hotel receptionist?” El País Thriley (talk) 01:51, 23 November 2021 (UTC) That hook is 197 characters which puts it in discretionary territory. Given though that the hookiness here is that she did all of these non-acting jobs, I think in this case the length is justified since it hasn't reached the limit. I say ALT3 is pretty good and can be approved. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 23:23, 23 November 2021 (UTC) If others find the hook too long, one possibility could be to delete the mention of Almodóvar.

Should "instriptions" (before the Drusus heading) be "inscriptions"? Should the names of scholars be wikilinked, where there is a page for the author (e.g. Simek)? What does mss mean, and could this be explained when it is first referenced?

To be expected, since they're cited almost 20 times each, and since the vast majority of the matches concern long quotes I'm willing to overlook it, but can we add more citations throughout the paragraphs? Particularly with "Conflict with Miles and Reynolds", there's four citations crammed at the end of the section. I think we should cite each after the corresponding sentences, especially where there's a direct quotation. Also for ALT0 we need a citation at the ends of the sentences for "Golden Boy" and "Whiz Kid". Otherwise nice read, and good use of sources.

Its long enough and new and lots of good refs - including the hook fact. It documents a notable woman from the 14th century and there were not many of those.

Nice addition. well done Victuallers (talk) 10:31, 6 November 2021 (UTC) Reopening this because I think the hook is misleading, as according to the source it was usual for women of the nobility, like Neville, to sign with their own names. Gatoclass (talk) 02:10, 19 November 2021 (UTC) @Gatoclass: I don't think most will know that, so maybe we go with ALT1 or some variation on it? We don't need to say it's unusual if we phrase it that way theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 02:14, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Theleekycauldron, the problem with both hooks is that they imply that there was something out-of-the-ordinary in a woman signing something in her own name in that era, whereas the source indicates that was normal practice for women of the nobility. So the hooks are misleading. Gatoclass (talk) 02:19, 19 November 2021 (UTC) All right—I'll ping @Lajmmoore and Victuallers: back here, y'all can work this out. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 02:33, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Was it usual for women in the fourteenth century to sign with their own name ... no. Is is usual for women in the 21st century to sign with just their first name? No. So "did you know that unusually Canada's head of state signs documents with just her first name and an R for Regina?" (Someone shouts) "BUT all British Queens do that!!" (Someone shouts) "That implies that it was unusual for Queens to sign with just their first name." No it doesnt. I think @Gatoclass: is reading the source and then saying that the hook doesnt explain every piece of information in the source... which obviously it doesnt. Its unusual that "a woman" is doing this at all. It WAS unusual for women in the fourteenth century to sign and if they did then they did not usually use just their own name. Its a fact - its unusual. Did You know that women did not sign their own names on documents in the 14th century? No I didnt. That is something that Lajmmoore wrote about and now I know. Thanks. Victuallers (talk) 08:28, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Hello Gatoclass all so the part of the source I was using is this, which is talking about signatures for charitable donation "Although most of the widows declare themselves to be the wife of their late husband, or their father's daughter, others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names, such as 'domina Margareta de Longvl' and 'don-ýina Margareta de Nevill' (the same person). The majority of widows declare that their marital status and their power to act, using a variety of phrases, including 'in pura viduitate', 'in pura viduitate mea et ligia potestate', and 'in viduitate mea propria et potestate legitima' ..." and I read that as it was more usual for (noble) women to use a signature that described them as "wife of, etc..." I read the passage as Legg using Margaret de Neville as an unusual example. Legg is talking about the Coucher Book signatures specifically, but I still think they are marking out unusual practice. In terms of the hook, I wonder whether changing 'woman' to 'literate woman' might work? Lajmmoore (talk) 09:32, 19 November 2021 (UTC) No, it wouldn't work just to add "literate". And your reading of the text just amounts to an unsupported assumption on your part. Because while the text could admittedly be less ambiguous, the statement that others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names does not in any way suggest that it was rare or unusual for a member of the nobility to give their name, it only states that members of the nobility as a class were inclined to give their names. So there isn't sufficient support in that statement for a hook which implies that Neville's act was in any way unusual for a member of her class. The hook makes Neville sound like some sort of proto-feminist who boldly challenged the system, when the underlying source only indicates that either her entire class did the same thing, or at least that it was an accepted practice for members of the nobility. So I still think that either the hook needs to be substantially reworked to more closely reflect the source, or a new hook be found. Gatoclass (talk) 02:53, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks for sharing your interpretation of your text Gatoclass. My interpretation (& so the hook) is based on Legg's use of the word most - in that "most of the widows declare themselves to be the wife of their late husband, or their father's daughter" and you rightly point out "others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names" but I think that needs to be balanced by the "most" earlier in the sentence i.e. for women generally, they don't give their name, but some noble women do but overall, for women signing their name, it is unusual enough to be pointed out in the text.

Whispyhistory (talk) 06:32, 13 November 2021 (UTC) I don't see that exact sequence of numbers in the source, although there are others that look a bit like an IP address. The trouble is, the nominator seems to be the source for it looking a bit like an IP address, which it does, but we can't use that unless the source makes a similar point, which it does not appear to do.

Philafrenzy (talk) 10:16, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Regarding the image, it's a fun idea but I don't think we run images as quizzes and the image is simply a skeletal foot, and not closely enough related to the hook.

I don't see how the hook you're suggesting is hooky. What exactly is wrong with the hook proposed? It's in the article and it's supported by the sources cited. And the image is directly related to the hook. It engages the reader into a spotting game. Dr. Vogel (talk) 14:57, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Like everyone else, I rather like the IP-address hook. If we wikilinked IP address, it would be supported in the linked articles, and fulfill the requirement that anyone following the links will be able to verify the hook. I don't think we need sourcing that says that a specific sequence of numbers is an IP address, as we have sources giving the general format of an IP address, and creating an example would be a trivial calculation ("Are all four of these numbers separated by periods in the range 0-255?"): "IPv4 and IPv6 address formats". www.ibm.com. An IPv4 address has the following format: x . x . x . x where x is called an octet and must be a decimal value between 0 and 255. Octets are separated by periods. An IPv4 address must contain three periods and four octets. The following examples are valid IPv4 addresses: 1 . 2 . 3 . 4 01 . 102 . 103 . 104 This hook is better than any alternative I can think of, and I don't see anything likely to be problematic about it (it's certainly verifiable). I think we might be in agreement on that? So if some rule technically prohibits it, we might have a good case for applying the WP:Ignore all the rules policy. Broken finger is also currently DYK-eligible and I think it uses the same numbering scheme.[1] HLHJ (talk) 02:07, 14 November 2021 (UTC) [edit: add fulltext url] I don't necessarily agree with the reading of WP:DYKCRIT 3b ( Each fact in the hook must be supported in the article by at least one inline citation to a reliable source [...]) that says that the IP thing needs to be in the article (compare e.g. Template:Did you know nominations/Urine deflector, which similarly took some creative licence in how the proposed hooks were phrased beyond what was stated in either the article or the cited source), and I agree with HLHJ that WP:IAR would be applicable regardless. As for the hooks themselves, writing "a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone may be described as 88.5.3.2" is a much poorer way of writing the hook (less "hooky") than the converse, i.e. "88.5.3.2 may refer to a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone". TompaDompa (talk) 11:28, 14 November 2021 (UTC) This. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 17:01, 16 November 2021 (UTC) We can't use IP address because the nominator just thought it up "oh, that looks like an IP address". It's not in the source as the nominator admits and therefore is not verifiable. And so what if it does look like an IP address? What does that tell us about broken toes? I like clever or quirky hooks and have written many (if I may say so), but they have to be based on something in the sources otherwise it's things made up one day. Philafrenzy (talk) 10:19, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you for all your comments. This is not the place to ignore all rules. The proposed hook is not supported by the source given in the article. I am inclined to approve ALT1 but it needs checking, unless another hook is proposed. Whispyhistory (talk) 15:11, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Oh dear, this has become contentious. I think the contended question is whether it's acceptable to have verified information not found in the nominated article, but only in another article, linked in the hook. Not as hooky, but for illustration: ALT3 ... that the dot-decimal notation string "88.5.3.2" is not only an an IPv4 address, but also a fracture in the middle of the bone at the tip of the little toe? "IPv4 and IPv6 address formats". www.ibm.com., Hallux proximal phalanx fracture in adults: an overlooked diagnosis I don't think we're debating whether the IP-address-hook statement is verifiable. The statement that "88.5.3.2" (and any number in that format) is a valid IPv4 address is supported by the IP address article and the IPv4 article, and this format is the subject of the Dot-decimal notation article. No-one had bothered to cite those statements in those articles, but since they've been challenged here, I've now cited them. So "88.5.3.2 is both an IP address[1] and a code for a broken toebone[2]" is certainly verifiable, and is now verified on Wikipedia. Any DYK reader should have no trouble verifying that the hook is accurate. Alternatives that do not mention IP addressees are not as hooky, but don't contain more information about broken toes: ALT4 ... that "88.5.3.2" is a toe fracture in the middle of the bone at the tip of the little toe, while a "78.5.3.2" is the parallel broken finger?

Your comment higher up about "88.5.3.2" and "ip address" not being in the source is true and I am grateful for your suggested alts. Essentially, the initial and subsequent hooks sound good, but none are in the article or the source. I don't wish for personal comments and don't mind if someone else wishes to take over here. With due respect @DrVogel: and @HLHJ:...You may wish to take this up at Wikipedia talk:Did you know. Whispyhistory (talk) 10:41, 15 November 2021 (UTC) I won't say I wish I hadn't written the article; I hope it's useful enough to make up for the social harm to the project here. I don't think the hostility was intended by anyone; I suspect that it's felt partly due to the ease of mininterpretation in a text-only medium and partly due to human cognitive biases.[2] I certainly did, and do, not intend it. I spent a day's editing trying to resolve the conflict by finding references specifically saying that the two things were in notation X and adding that text to the article, but unfortunately non-inductive descriptions of the notations seem to have been considered so needless that an Internet RFC attempting to formalize them died of disinterest. I did find a source that explicitly defines the IPv4 format, and one that explicitly says that 88.1.2.2 is a specific fracture, and I've cited the latter in the article, but I don't think this helps. It is probably a bit unreasonable to expect a reviewer to do more than apply rules as best they can, and Wikipedia talk:Did you know might indeed be a better forum for a more detailed discussion. I don't really want to take part in one, though (nothing to do with this discussion, prior reasons). I posted because I felt responsible for the conflict and thought I might be able to help. My impression is that I made it worse; my apologies to everyone I've offended. HLHJ (talk) 03:41, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Nobody is offended, but if I may say so I think you are still missing the point. IP addresses have nothing to do with broken toes even if that notation may have a similarity. That's why the sources don't make the comparison and why the IP-based hooks are no good. Any of the other hooks might be fine (I haven't checked the numbers) just without the bit about IP addresses. The whole thing reminds me of unusually shaped vegetables where you may see a carrot shaped like a foot, people who see faces in clouds, and even apophenia. My personal observation that one thing looks a bit like another is not the basis for a hook unless reliable sources make the point too. Philafrenzy (talk) 09:09, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Folks, we are wasting a wonderful hook. Really. IP addresses have nothing to do with broken toes even if that notation may have a similarity and that is the whole point of making good hooks. They are supposed to be short, punchy, catchy, and likely to draw the readers in to wanting to read the article – as long as they don't misstate the article content. And one of the best recipes to make a hook good is to make it sound counterintuitive With any other option but the original, we are bound to receive another hook frequented by maybe a few hundred visitors. I would propose something to the tune of in some contexts, 88.5.3.2 might not mean an IP address but a broken bone in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone? so that no one claims here that we somehow delegitimise the IP address but at the same time so that we preserve the core of the hook. As for the claims that because the hook is not cited in the IP part, it can't be there - please don't be that pedantic. In our today's world of informatics we may assume that people who visit Wikipedia more or less imagine what IP addresses are, and may more or less imagine how they look like (in the worst case they will visit the article for details). The other part is cited. I see no problem with the original. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 17:01, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Szmenderowiecki I admit that I'm not very familiar with the topic, and the above discussion was confusing, but is the "this isn't an IP address" claim actually in the source? Because if it's not, then no matter how good the hook proposal is, it can't be used in a hook since hook facts need to be based on a reference. Also, I'm pretty sure that assumptions don't count as sources. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:31, 17 November 2021 (UTC) What I was leading is that we don't need to cite that the sky is blue, or that we have five fingers; or that there exist IP addresses for that matter. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 11:08, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Given that these IP number hooks aren't working out so far, I wonder if some other hooks unrelated to that could be proposed here. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 02:11, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Comment only If we accept the first hook we will end up with thousands of hits, some quiet smiles and some who will continue to believe that DYK broke the rules. We're allowed to. This is not a massive occasion where we can save the whole project by breaking the rules. Its a trivial example of what some (not all) think may be a breach in the rules, with a small, but amusing, advantage. So I'm not asking the defenders of the rules to admit that this is not a breech ... I am suggesting that they might just concede that the harm done by allowing this hook might not offend anyone ... and it might please a few thousand. Victuallers (talk) 15:28, 20 November 2021 (UTC) We don't need to break the rules. The observation that the notation looks a bit like an IP address is trivial and completely unrelated to broken toes. There are already perfectly good hooks above that work better. Nobody is saying don't use the numbers, just strike the bit about IP addresses. The originally proposed hook is not the work of comic genius and cleverness that some seem to think it is. Philafrenzy (talk) 21:58, 20 November 2021 (UTC) The main issue here is that it's one of the core rules of DYK that hook facts must be mentioned in the article, ideally explicitly or at least implied by supporting information. The thing is that at the moment, IP addresses are not mentioned anywhere in the article, so the hooks using the IP address angle would be ineligible according to that criterion anyway. Even April Fools hooks, which tend to be misleading, are still generally based on hook facts that are mentioned in the respective articles. So if we can't even grant IAR exemptions for that criterion for AFD hooks, the one day of the year where our hooks tend to follow the rules most loosely, I can't see why such a request should be granted here.

Nominated by Victuallers (talk) at 16:21, 6 November 2021 (UTC). Article is new enough. Two correct writers are credited. The article is fully referenced. No copyvio detected. There is a bit of biased POV pushing in Wikipedia voice: "most vulnerable to climate change". This will be something our subject is saying no doubt. And this idea is also reflected in the hook with "endangered". The hook content is referenced and confirmed by the Guardian, apart from the "endangered" bit, which opinion is attributed to Tina Stege. So I suggest that "endangered" is taken out of the hook, or it is reworded so it is clear she is saying that. Hook alt1 is unsuitable as it does not link the article and I cannot tell what it is trying to say in relation to the subject. I can confirm image is CC-BY-3.0 as derived from the video with CC-BY-3.0 license. However I would suggest that a different image is selected from the video, perhaps near the end where the microphone is not obscuring her chin. QPQ is done. Graeme Bartlett (talk) 06:03, 15 November 2021 (UTC) @Graeme Bartlett: Thanks for the review Graeme - I have recut a new image. Surprised that "endangered" wasn't referenced.

Graeme Bartlett (talk) 20:56, 22 November 2021 (UTC) @Graeme Bartlett: Are you suggesting that we imply that "endangered" is her opinion despite the fact that she represents a nation and the "endangered" aspect is supported by the World Bank and the Guardian newspaper (and the 1bn people estimated to be part of the "High Ambition" group ) saying so? Is there any evidence that is just her opinion and not that of her country and the World Bank? Am I missing something? It you feel you need to give this "a cross" then can I suggest that we ask for a new reviewer?I have suggested an alt that does not use the endangered word.

Self-nominated at 23:51, 4 November 2021 (UTC). @DferDaisy: This article is about 3300 bytes, and was nominated for DYK shortly after creation, satisfying date and length criteria. There is a factual error, as the article states she was interred in Keokuk, Illinois, but the source says she died in Chicago, Illinois and was interred in Keokuk, Iowa. I am assuming good faith for a few references I cannot access (for example, ref 15 - The National Humane Review), which for me gives a landing page for the document, instead of an inside view). Otherwise, everything is properly sourced and there are no copyvio or close paraphrasing concerns (Earwig cites 3 potential problems, but they are not an issue here.) QPQ not required. Regarding the hooks, ALT0 is incorrect as stated, as it reads as if the study was conducted in the early 1900s by Meigs Crowder, whereas she published it in 1917 based on studies from that period. It'll need minor alteration. ALT1 is fine and sourced. I would prefer to promote an amended ALT0. A minor quibble, though not an issue for DYK: please add page numbers for cited sources. If online access is eliminated from the sources, it'll force anyone investigating those sources to wade through too many pages to find the desired detail.

AleatoryPonderings (???) (!!!) 01:52, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @AleatoryPonderings: Yes, but note that this court case is the "leading case with respect to the issue of common employers", establishing a precedent in Canadian law. At the time the lawsuit was filed, this was not the case, and in fact the trial judge ruled against Alouche (see last paragraph of background section); it was only after the case was brought to the Court of Appeal for Ontario that the "common employer doctrine" was established, and it became entrenched when leave to appeal the decision at the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed. Mindmatrix 15:11, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Ah, so the idea behind the hook is that, since Downtown Eatery changed the law on common employers, before Downtown Eatery Best Beaver would not have been Alouche's employer? That makes more sense. AleatoryPonderings (???) (!!!) 15:20, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: I'm going to inspect this again... Mindmatrix 15:18, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @AleatoryPonderings: Alright, so to ensure everything is correct, the following timeline occurred: Alouche was hired to be manager at For Your Eyes Only (owned by Grad and Grosman), and began work on 29 December 1992 Alouche was sent a Notice of Discipline in May 1993, and was fired on 15 June 1993 In October 1993, Alouche filed action for wrongful dismissal against Best Beaver Management Inc., as that was the source of his paycheques Best Beaver ceased operations in mid-1996, and all assets distributed to other companies owned by Grad and Grosman The trial resolved in favour of Alouche Best Beaver did not pay out the judgement (all its assets had been redistributed) Sherriffs were dispatched to For Your Eyes Only, where they seized $1,855 Downtown Eatery filed claim against Alouche, stating the cash belonged to it Alouche defended, and counterclaimed against Grad, Grosman, and all companies they controlled on the grounds of common employer doctrine, the oppression remedy of the Ontario Business Corporations Act, and fraudulent conveyance the judge in the second trial (at Ontario Superior Court of Justice) ruled against Alouche the case was brought to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, where the previous ruling was overturned in 2001 in January 2002, an application for leave to appeal the decision at the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed So, the common employer doctrine was part of the second trial as a counterclaim to the suit filed by Downtown Eatery. I just wanted to ensure this satisfies your concerns. Mindmatrix 18:25, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks for this incredibly thorough response. My concern is maybe philosophical or definitional. If I say that company A employs person B, that has an ordinary meaning and a legal meaning. It is probably right that Best Beaver did not employ Alouche in the ordinary sense of "employ", because Best Beaver was a "paymaster" and not the name on the front of the building where he went to work. My reading of the case itself is that, before Downtown Eatery, it was at best indeterminate as a legal matter whether Best Beaver, alone or in combination with its affiliate companies, employed Alouche. After Downtown Eatery, it was established—as a matter of legal meaning, but not necessarily ordinary meaning—that Best Beaver was his employer, or part of his employer, or something like that. The reason I brought this up is that it's not clear how one could verify the claim that "Best Beaver was not Alouche's employer", because that claim might be true as a matter of ordinary meaning but the only authoritative legal ruling we have on this (namely, Downtown Eatery) holds that the claim is false. In any event, I'll leave this to the eventual reviewer to sort out. I find my brain twisting into knots. AleatoryPonderings (???)

To add to that, the YouTube link does not appear to be uploaded by an official channel, making it unreliable. Additionally, per MOS:FILMCAST uncredited roles need a source. the copyvio checker showed up a 50%+ similarity with a source, which may suggest over quotation. On top of that, the subject has unclear notability. I'm unsure which roles are significant and The House on Pine Street appears to have a questionable notability. None of her awards seem significant and I'm not seeing any significant coverage from reliable, independent sources. ALT0 isn't very interesting given the festival is not significant enough to have an article.

Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 13:42, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Narutolovehinata5 Sorry about that, I am new to DYK, this is my second nomination, unfortunately I was trying to get some alternatives, however the ones which have been provided by Urve seem good as well. ALT1 I think is a decent one. I side with you on changing to co-hosted. ALT2 seems broad and a bit vague. ALT3 is a good one as well. The Nelson Mandela one would certainly attract. I however still feel ALT 0 GLO-CAF Awards is a good one too, with your comment on it not being clear, should the CAF be expanded into Confederation of African Football then put into bracket as (CAF) perhaps that may help? The inclusion of Nigerian actor RMD's name was to help make it interesting as well. These are my views. Thank you. Ampimd (talk) 15:21, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I think in this case ALT1 and ALT3 would have more international appeal. Would like to hear Urve's response here before approving them though.

Maximilian Dood ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that in August 2021, YouTuber Maximilian Dood's viral social media campaign for Marvel vs. Capcom 2's rerelease caught the regards of studio Digital Eclipse, who expressed interest in rereleasing the game? Source: 1 and 2 Comment: This is the first time I’ve ever made a DYK here, so here goes. I personally find this fact interesting because it highlights how the advent of YouTube, and internet fame in general, has allowed people to use their voice to reach people in positions of high influence, bringing hidden ideas to light and advocating for change. While this specific example falls under a video game/pop-culture category, and may not fit Wikipedia’s desire for academic material, I feel that this is interesting enough to share, as it’s one the gaming community can relate to, like with other social media trends such as #FreeSmash and "Rerelease Mother 3." As for the article itself, all of the citations should be reliable enough; they’re all from third-party/secondary source outlets and there isn’t any BLP violation to be found here. One concern I have is criteria #3 - “Each fact in the hook must be supported in the article by at least one inline citation to a reliable source, appearing no later than the end of the sentence(s) offering that fact. Citations at the end of the paragraph are not sufficient.” While the hook is sourced in the article, the refs are at the end of the section rather than per each sentence. I can fix that however. Anyway, I hope this fact does get accepted! If not, I understand, thanks for reviewing this anyway. Created/expanded by PantheonRadiance (talk). Self-nominated at 08:45, 17 November 2021 (UTC).

Article is new enough, very newsworthy event and hence well-sourced, no copyvios (Earwig reports a false positive on the Johnson quotation), QPQ done.

Newness requirement satisfied by 5x expansion on 11/15 from < 600 to > 3000 characters. Articles also long enough and compliant with core policies on citations and neutrality. The hook is in-line sourced. Photo has appropriate license. QPQ is done. There are, however, two problems: (1) There is some significant overlap with this source. To start, the following sentence is taken from the source without use of quotation marks and with no effort to paraphrase rather than use the precise words: "Local advocacy led to the establishment of Bridle Trails as a state park in 1932." Further, this sentence also strikes me as too closely drawn from the same source: "Initial park development dates to 1933 when Civil Works Administration employees and federal relief workers were employed in state parks as part of the New Deal program. Further work included burning logging debris, clearing brush and building trails and fences." Work needs to be done to put the material into your own words. (2) The hook strikes me as boring in that it states an obvious point. Horses having the right of way on this trail is not unique or special. On trails that are shared by humans and horses, it is the general rule that horses have the right of way. See here ("In general, horses always have the right of way, followed by hikers, then by bikers."). See also here ("For safety reasons, if you come across a horse and rider on any trail they always have right of way. Hikers and bike riders all yield to horses.")

For one, the quote is not actually "could have been made by aliens" so, considering this is all about misquotation, we should either use the actual quote or clarify that it is a misquotation. Then "as though it was a real announcement" implies that it was actually, I don't know, a fake announcement? A parody?

Source: "Unveiling the statue of Queen Victoria at Harrogate", Leeds Mercury, 7 October 1887: "This is a statue of the Queen in white marble ... Her necklace contains the famous Koh-i-Noor."

As far as I am aware, Queen Victoria never wore the Koh-i-Noor set in a necklace, though she did wear it set in a brooch and in a circlet (headdress). So the necklace with the Koh-i-Noor in this sculpture is probably artistic licence. Created by Storye book (talk). Self-nominated at 16:10, 17 November 2021 (UTC). Captivating storey of a life and career, meticulously referenced on plenty of fine sources, offline sources accepted AGF, no copyvio obvious. The image is licensed. The hook works, but I don't see the diamond in the image. I am willing to approve it but would like to discuss other options: mention the artistic license, because I didn't know the detail of her not wearing that gem in a necklace don't mention the diamond detail, focus on the jubilee, and use the second image from the gallery which show the greatness of the design better than the head detail base a hook on the Warrior/Youth work which I find much more attractive as an artwork, and as an image in small size ;) Let me know. Take that article to GA please, I think it's ready. - Graham87, can you please do the history merge for him? --Gerda Arendt (talk) 06:57, 18 November 2021 (UTC) @Gerda Arendt: I didn't do the history merge because it's not needed. Graham87 09:41, 18 November 2021 (UTC) @Gerda Arendt: Thank you for the review. Diamonds were often cut in cabochon style in the 19th century and earlier. This one was cut with a flat bottom like all cabochons, and when viewed from above, it was a large oval, about 1.5 inches long. Modern cabochons usually have a smoothly rounded surface; this one was lightly faceted but the facets don't show on the sculpture. So it looks like half an egg, I suppose. The Koh-i-Noor is the large oval at the bottom of the picture. We have no specific citation for artistic licence - that is just a conclusion that we can probably make, since we have no evidence that Victoria ever had it set in a necklace. Therefore I cannot use "artistic licence" in a hook or in the article. I'll have a go at a hook using a full-length Victoria, and another hook using the Warrior and Wounded Youth sculpture. I'll come back shortly with those.

I've been trying to come up with something catchy on this -- for example, had Comeau invited Trump to participate in a performance of the work, then we could say he told Trump to fugue himself -- but the sourcing just isn't there that I can see.

I therefore want to use this platform to suggest ways we can contribute to meaningful anti-Trump resistance.". We'd need to flesh out the article with these WP:BLPPRIMARY sources for the "thinks" to be properly verifiable.

Source: several Reviewed: to come Created by Gerda Arendt (talk) and RandomCanadian (talk). Nominated by Gerda Arendt (talk) at 19:27, 21 November 2021 (UTC). I don't think this is ready for DYK. There's a lot of scholarship on this particular piece (to which I have access). I think it would be better if we waited. WP:NORUSH is a thing, and there's enough for me to expand this to something more reasonable once I'm not busy with end-of-term business IRL. Cheers, RandomCanadian (talk / contribs) 19:40, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Nomination couldn't wait another day - 7 days after creation. --Gerda Arendt (talk) 21:26, 21 November 2021 (UTC) @Gerda Arendt: The alternative path to DYK, which I assume you know too, is to expand this at a later point (possibly all the way to GA). I'm quite confident a more expanded article would be a more attractive thing to present to the reader (and there would be plenty of more interesting hooks. Did you know that a recently discovered 1692 libretto of an actual Abendmusik bears similarities to Wacht! Euch zum Streit?[1][2]. Or that the Abendmusiken were actually presented right after Vespers?[3] Vespers, which themselves lasted two or three hours, in addition to a further three or four hour Hauptgottesdienst in the morning?[4][5] That might be one of the reasons why the audience was reported to be so disorderly, to the point that the town watch had to be hired to maintain a semblance of order.[6] That, and a lot more, which would surely allow to take this to DYK at a later time, after having greatly expanded this. Or at least, it's my opinion that taking the sole opportunity for DYK now would be a waste when it can be done when the article is expanded and made into something significantly more attractive and informative.

This can't be approved without a qpq, - after nominating, there's time. --Gerda Arendt (talk) 23:34, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Because I'm busy IRL (as you can deduce from the fact of my lesser than usual activity)? Fact is, I have the score and the whole text (including in translation) with me, in addition to lots of critical commentary on the piece itself (too much of which is focused on the question of authenticity, but alas...) and on the Abendmusiken in general. This can be used to make a proper article, but it would require time, which at the moment I really need to put into meeting an actual deadline than here. I've given you a list of pertinent sources (many of which are in German, if that's easier for you), if you're interested you know where to ask. On top of all of that, there's the question of article title (should it be at the current one or at Wacht! Euch zum Streit gefasset macht (a title which is used in a fair amount of sources, too...) Cheers, RandomCanadian (talk / contribs) 00:01, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Short version of what I replied on my talk: The time for it is in Advent. This year or next, that is the question. I'm also busy with other things, and both your familiarity with the topic, and your better English, make me wish you did it. For DYK, just raising attention is the goal. If you want it GA, we probably better wait.

Overall: Article meets eligibility criteria. i.e newness and article length. Article is well sourced and is neutral in tone. Hook is interesting and is cited. Copyvio scores ~20% in major part due to a quote that has been attributed rightly. However, the nominator might want to consider removing the quote and rewriting the sentence because the original Nepal Times article does not have it as a quote and is likely a paraphrasing done by the newspaper to begin with. Hence, we should not include it as a quote. In addition, I would encourage the nominator to consider expanding the article - to be clear, the article is good to go as-is. But looking at Hanuman Dhoka for instance there is an opportunity to build this article more than just a "History" section. Handing it back to the nominator. Some work and this is ready for homepage.

Further information: Official supplementary guidelines and unofficial guide  Warning: You are not logged in. Please create an account or log in to proceed. Alternatively, you may leave a message at the bottom of the DYK project talk page with the article you would like to nominate and the hook you would like to propose.  Warning: The helper script only works on desktop. Please switch to desktop view to continue. Install the DYK helper script by adding the line {{subst:lusc|User:SD0001/DYK-helper.js}} to your common.js page. Go back to the article, and choose the "DYK" option from the "More" menu (see image). Fill in the form and submit it. Check back periodically to address comments or concerns from the reviewer (it may take several weeks). Manual instructions[edit] Create a subpage for your new DYK suggestion and then list the page below under the date the article was created or the expansion began or it became a good article (not the date you submit it here), with the newest dates at the bottom. Any registered user may nominate a DYK suggestion (if you are not a registered user, please leave a message at the bottom of the DYK project talk page with the details of the article you would like to nominate and the hook you would like to propose); self-nominations are permitted and encouraged. Thanks for participating and please remember to check back for comments on your nomination (consider watchlisting your nomination page). Read these instructions completely before proceeding. For simplified instructions, see User:Rjanag/Quick DYK 2. I. Create the nomination subpage. Enter the article title in the box below and click the button. (To nominate multiple articles together, enter any or all of the article titles.) You will then be taken to a preloaded nomination page. II. Write the nomination. On the nomination page, fill in the relevant information. See Template:NewDYKnomination and {{NewDYKnomination/guide}} for further information. Not every line of the template needs to be filled in. For instance, if you are not nominating an image to appear with your hook, there is no need to fill in the image-related lines. Add an edit summary e.g. "Nominating YOUR ARTICLE TITLE for DYK" and click Publish page. Make sure the nomination page is on your watchlist, so you can follow the review discussion. III. Post at Template talk:Did you know. In the current nominations section find the subsection for the date on which the article was created or on which expansion began (or, if a new Good Article, the date on which it became a GA), not the date on which you make the nomination. At the top of that subsection (before other nominations already there, but below the section head and hidden comment) add {{Did you know nominations/YOUR ARTICLE TITLE}}. Add an edit summary e.g. "Nominating YOUR ARTICLE TITLE for DYK" and click Publish page. Frequently asked questions[edit] How do I write an interesting hook? Successful hooks tend to have several traits. Most importantly, they share a surprising or intriguing fact. They give readers enough context to understand the hook, but leave enough out to make them want to learn more. They are written for a general audience who has no prior knowledge of or interest in the topic area. Lastly, they are concise, and do not attempt to cover multiple facts or present information about the subject beyond what's needed to understand the hook. When will my nomination be reviewed? This page is often backlogged. As long as your submission is still on the page, it will stay there until an editor reviews it. Since editors are encouraged to review the oldest submissions first, it may take several weeks until your submission is reviewed. In the meantime, please consider reviewing another submission (not your own) to help reduce the backlog (see instructions below). Where is my hook? If you can't find the nomination you submitted to this nominations page, it may have been approved and is on the approved nominations page waiting to be promoted. It could also have been added to one of the prep areas, promoted from prep to a queue, or is on the main page. If the nominated hook is in none of those places, then the nomination has probably been rejected. Such a rejection usually only occurs if it was at least a couple of weeks old and had unresolved issues for which any discussion had gone stale. If you think your nomination was unfairly rejected, you can query this on the DYK discussion page, but as a general rule such nominations will only be restored in exceptional circumstances. Instructions for reviewers[edit] Main page: Wikipedia:Did you know/Reviewing guide Any editor who was not involved in writing/expanding or nominating an article may review it by checking to see that the article meets all the DYK criteria (long enough, new enough, no serious editorial or content issues) and the hook is cited. Editors may also alter the suggested hook to improve it, suggest new hooks, or even lend a hand and make edits to the article to which the hook applies so that the hook is supported and accurate. For a more detailed discussion of the DYK rules and review process see the supplementary guidelines and the WP:Did you know/Reviewing guide. To post a comment or review on a DYK nomination, follow the steps outlined below: Look through this page, Template talk:Did you know, to find a nomination you would like to comment on. Click the "Review or comment" link at the top of the nomination. You will be taken to the nomination subpage. The top of the page includes a list of the DYK criteria. Check the article to ensure it meets all the relevant criteria. To indicate the result of the review (i.e., whether the nomination passes, fails, or needs some minor changes), leave a signed comment on the page. Please begin with one of the 5 review symbols that appear at the top of the edit screen, and then indicate all aspects of the article that you have reviewed; your comment should look something like the following: Article length and age are fine, no copyvio or plagiarism concerns, reliable sources are used. But the hook needs to be shortened. If you are the first person to comment on the nomination, there will be a line :* <!-- REPLACE THIS LINE TO WRITE FIRST COMMENT, KEEPING  :* --> showing you where you should put the comment. Save the page. If there is any problem or concern about a nomination, please consider notifying the nominator by placing {{subst:DYKproblem|Article|header=yes|sig=yes}} on the nominator's talk page. Instructions for project members[edit] How to promote an accepted hook[edit] At-a-glance instructions on how to promote an approved hook to a Prep area See Wikipedia:Did you know/Preparation areas for details on verifying a hook's acceptability. Promoters should not promote their own nomination or their own review When promoting hooks intended for a particular date, keep in mind that when the number of available approved nominations exceeds 120 we switch to two sets per day, and when that number drops below 60 we return to one set per day. Check list for nomination review completeness 1) Select a hook from the approved nominations page that has one of these ticks at the bottom post: . 2) Check to make sure basic review requirements were completed. a. Any outstanding issue following needs to be addressed before promoting. 3) Check the article history for any substantive changes since it was nominated or reviewed. 4) Images for the lead slot must be freely licensed. Fair-use images are not permitted. Images loaded on Commons that appear on the Main Page are automatically protected by KrinkleBot. 5) Hook must be stated in both the article and source (which must be cited at the end of the article sentence where stated). 6) Hook should make sense grammatically. 7) Try to vary subject matters within each prep area. 8) Try to select a funny, quirky or otherwise upbeat hook for the last or bottom hook in the set. Steps to add a hook to prep In one tab, open the nomination page of the hook you want to promote. In a second tab, open the prep set you intend to add the hook to. 1) For hooks held for specific dates, refer to "Local update times" section on DYK Queue. a. Completed Prep area number sets will be promoted by an administrator to corresponding Queue number. 2) Copy and paste the hook into a chosen slot. a. Make sure there's a space between ... and that, and a ? at the end. b. Check that there's a bold link to the article. 3) If it's the lead (first) hook, paste the image where indicated at the top of the template. 4) Copy and paste ALL the credit information (the {{DYKmake}} and {{DYKnom}} templates) at the bottom 5) Check your work in the prep's Preview mode. a. At the bottom under "Credits", to the right of each article should have the link "View nom subpage" ; if not, a subpage parameter will need to be added to the DYKmake. 6) Save the Prep page. Closing the DYK nomination page At the upper left Change {{DYKsubpage to {{subst:DYKsubpage Change |passed= to |passed=yes At the bottom Just above the line containing }}<!--Please do not write below this line or remove this line. Place comments above this line.--> insert a new, separate line containing one of the following: To [[T:DYK/P1|Prep 1]] To [[T:DYK/P2|Prep 2]] To [[T:DYK/P3|Prep 3]] To [[T:DYK/P4|Prep 4]] To [[T:DYK/P5|Prep 5]] To [[T:DYK/P6|Prep 6]] To [[T:DYK/P7|Prep 7]] Also paste the same thing into the edit summary. Check in Preview mode. Make sure everything is against a pale blue background (nothing outside) and there are no stray characters, like }}, at the top or bottom. Save. For more information, please see T:TDYK#How to promote an accepted hook. Handy copy sources: To [[T:DYK/P1|Prep 1]] To [[T:DYK/P2|Prep 2]] To [[T:DYK/P3|Prep 3]] To [[T:DYK/P4|Prep 4]] To [[T:DYK/P5|Prep 5]] To [[T:DYK/P6|Prep 6]] To [[T:DYK/P7|Prep 7]] How to remove a rejected hook[edit] Open the DYK nomination subpage of the hook you would like to remove. (It's best to wait several days after a reviewer has rejected the hook, just in case someone contests or the article undergoes a large change.) In the window where the DYK nomination subpage is open, replace the line {{DYKsubpage with {{subst:DYKsubpage, and replace |passed= with |passed=no. Then save the page. This has the effect of wrapping up the discussion on the DYK nomination subpage in a blue archive box and stating that the nomination was unsuccessful, as well as adding the nomination to a category for archival purposes. How to remove a hook from the prep areas or queue[edit] Edit the prep area or queue where the hook is and remove the hook and the credits associated with it. Go to the hook's nomination subpage (there should have been a link to it in the credits section). View the edit history for that page Go back to the last version before the edit where the hook was promoted, and revert to that version to make the nomination active again. Add a new icon on the nomination subpage to cancel the previous tick and leave a comment after it explaining that the hook was removed from the prep area or queue, and why, so that later reviewers are aware of this issue. Add a transclusion of the template back to this page so that reviewers can see it. It goes under the date that it was first created/expanded/listed as a GA. You may need to add back the day header for that date if it had been removed from this page. If you removed the hook from a queue, it is best to either replace it with another hook from one of the prep areas, or to leave a message at WT:DYK asking someone else to do so. How to move a nomination subpage to a new name[edit] Don't; it should not ever be necessary, and will break some links which will later need to be repaired. Even if you change the title of the article, you don't need to move the nomination page. Nominations[edit] Older nominations[edit] Articles created/expanded on September 2[edit] Articles created/expanded on September 27[edit] Roman campaigns in Germania (12 BC – AD 16) ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that the Romans won a series of campaigns against the Germanic tribes following the disaster at Teutoburg, but decided to leave Germany because its land was not considered valuable? Source: Wells (2003), The Battle That Stopped Rome, pp. 206–7 Improved to Good Article status by SpartaN (talk). Self-nominated at 03:34, 29 September 2021 (UTC). General eligibility: New Enough: Y Long Enough: Y Other problems: Y Policy compliance: Adequate sourcing: Y Neutral: Y Free of copyright violations, plagiarism, and close paraphrasing: Y Other problems: Y Hook eligibility: Cited: N - Source is offline but happy to AGF. However, in the article the statement “they considered German lands too poor for annexation” is sourced to p.204 of Wells. pp.206-7 referred to above is used to support that they that “it was too costly in economic and military resources” to go into in Germany. I guess either way the hook is sourced but could you clarify the exact sourcing of the hook. Interesting: Y QPQ: None required. Overall: Interesting thorough article, well-written with good quality sourcing. Earwig shows no issues. Just a minor query around the hook sourcing but otherwise will be good to go. DeCausa (talk) 08:23, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @DeCausa: I found the web link that (for me) shows a preview if you're able to see it: https://books.google.com/books?id=mc30CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA206&lpg=PA206 SpartaN (talk) 10:07, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @SpartaN: Thanks for providing the link. It’s prompted a couple of thoughts for me. Firstly, Wells doesn’t seem to be saying the reason for the withdrawal is definitively known (“… the reasons for these decisions must have lain…”) i.e he’s making an assumption, however well founded. The hook is more definite than Wells is. Secondly, Wells’ emphasis is on the strength of the resistance being behind the reason - the poor value of the territory makes it “not worth it” because of the strength of the resistance. That’s not quite the same as just saying the land wasn’t valuable. (I notice the text you used in the article on this reflects that effort/value ratio issue.) To fix both points would you be prepared to consider an ALT1 which after “…Teutoburg” continues something along the lines of “…likely decided to leave Germany because the military effort was out of proportion to the territory’s value?” although there may need to be some trimming to get it into the 200 character limit. DeCausa (talk) 11:12, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @SpartaN and DeCausa: It's been over a month since the last comments here, have there been any updates? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:31, 13 November 2021 (UTC) From my point of view I’m waiting for SpartaN’s reply to my last post here. But I notice they haven’t edited Wikipedia since then, over a month ago. So I’m not quite sure what can be done. DeCausa (talk) 08:17, 13 November 2021 (UTC) I see. Given that there's really only one issue holding the nomination back, would anyone be willing to adopt this in case SpartaN doesn't return? It would be a shame if the nomination failed at this point. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 06:35, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I’m not sure what exactly are the DYK rules on this but, subject to that, options could be (a) I propose an ALT1 hook and someone else signs it off; (b) someone else proposes an ALT1 hook and I sign it off; (c) if anyone disagrees with me on the original hook I’m happy to step away and they sign it off. DeCausa (talk) 11:04, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I've looked at the Wells source and concur that it is saying the withdrawal was more down to the ratio of effort required to potential reward, and have boldly tweaked the copy in the article to reflect this. For what it's worth, I think ALT1 works just fine. firefly ( t · c ) 11:16, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Ok. I’m just going to formalize the ALT1 and let someone else add the tick and sign off: ALT1:... that the Romans won a series of campaigns against the Germanic tribes after the disaster at Teutoburg but likely decided to leave Germany as the effort was out of proportion to the territory’s value? DeCausa (talk) 12:07, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Since the reviewer has proposed a new hook, another editor will be needed to sign this off. I'm not sure though if the section linking in the bold links is allowed, however. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:29, 15 November 2021 (UTC) sorry, I missed that. It’s not even necessary to link to a section of the article so I’ve taken it out of ALT1. DeCausa (talk) 08:21, 15 November 2021 (UTC) As this doesn’t seem to be moving I’m going to give ALT1 the tick as original reviewer. If the DYK regulars think this is out of process because I came up nwith ALT1 then happy for it to be reverted. DeCausa (talk) 22:46, 21 November 2021 (UTC) DeCausa, there is no rush to approve, and your approval of your own hook was indeed out of process. I have reverted SL93's promotion of the nomination to prep, and with any luck a new reviewer will be around soon enough to review your ALT1. (SL93, you're welcome to review it, but that means you cannot also promote it.) I've also struck the original hook due to the issues noted above. BlueMoonset (talk) 04:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) BlueMoonset Sorry for mixing up who approved it. SL93 (talk) 04:26, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I didn't notice the second sentence of the approval...not sure how that happened. Sorry, again. SL93 (talk) 04:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) DeCausa Reading through the article again, your ALT1 hook seems to be mostly verifed in the Aftermath section, but I'm not seeing any indication of it being "likely". SL93 (talk) 21:14, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, that’s true. Where that came from was, in the above discussion with SpartaN on the original hook, they cited Wells in support. Wells says, in relation to Tiberius’ decision to ‘give up’, that “The reason for these decisions must have lain in the Germans’ tough resistance”. I’ve taken that to mean Wells’ was inferring Tiberius’ reasoning without direct evidence (or certainty) of Tiberius’ actual reason. However, you’re right that the way the article is written is more certain. I’m ok striking the “likely” or, possibly it would be better to amend the final sentence of the first paragraph of the Aftermath section to be more reflectve of Wells. DeCausa (talk) 21:48, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I will leave this here for someone else to look at. It would be helpful if the nominator came back. SL93 (talk) 23:21, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Articles created/expanded on October 9[edit] Pankratius Pfeiffer ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that Salvatorian priest Pankratius Pfeiffer saved hundreds of Jews in Rome during the Second World War? Reviewed: 1936 Northeast Flood Created by Ergo Sum (talk). Self-nominated at 17:52, 9 October 2021 (UTC). New article that was created on 9 October 2021? is 3,212 characters and nominated on the same day. No copyvios detected and duplication detector of [1][2][3][4][5] reveal no close paraphrasing issues (AGF PDF docs which can't go through Dup detector). Article is well-sourced. Hook is 103 characters long (under 200 character max.) and is interesting. Refs 4 and 5 (verifying the hook) are reliable sources. QPQ done. Looks good to go! —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:41, 9 October 2021 (UTC) Too many red flags here. If he really saved hundreds of Jews, you would expect plenty of confirmation of this in scholarly sources and him to be recognized by Yad Vashem. I can't count the number of times that I've seen mainstream newspapers print completely false stories about Jews being rescued during the holocaust, so better sources are definitely needed to confirm these extraordinary claims. Thanks Brigade Piron for letting me know about this. (t · c) buidhe 16:51, 10 October 2021 (UTC) I have to admit I'm just a bit perplexed by the argument. Except in fairly uncommon cases of multiple RS that contradict each other, we don't generally recognize any "hierarchy" of reliable sources. Sources are either RS or they are not. So I'm not sure what kind of sources you have in mind as "better" sources. The ones currently cited in the article are all RS, so that should be the end of it. I might add that if you seek some manner of official imprimatur in the vein of Yad Vashem, the City of Rome named a street after him. Your point about why there isn't more extensive coverage of this historical figure is well taken but can easily be attributed to the fact that all manner of historical figures are lost to history, especially those who are notable really for one major event in their life that did not come to light until years later, as is the case here. Indeed, one of the RS in this article describes Pfeiffer as being "lost to history." I'm adding the new review icon here so that we can get at least one more editor's evaluation of this. Ergo Sum 13:32, 16 October 2021 (UTC) There are very few people who actually saved hundreds of Jews during the Holocaust and plenty of hoaxes that were reported as truth by various news organizations—for example Necdet Kent. In other cases, actual rescue did occur but the numbers are greatly exaggerated and repeated uncritically by news organizations, such as Raoul Wallenberg. If the story is true you would expect to see it covered in many more credible sources. There are plenty of cases where a source is reliable for some info but not others. For example, someone's CV is often reliable for "they worked at X organization" but not "they are a world expert in Z". Extraordinary claims require extraordinary sourcing. (t · c) buidhe 21:27, 16 October 2021 (UTC) I should say that I share Buidhe's concerns. I think saying that "all manner of historical figures are lost to history" rather side-steps the sheer volume of historical scholarship on all aspects of the Holocaust. On a more banal note, I think part of the problem is that the sources cited are, essentially, all journalistic sources published by explicitly Catholic or Salvatorian outlets. The specific sources cited for the "saved" claim are Romereports (I am not familiar with this outlet, but the typo in the video does not inspire confidence) and a self-published Salvatorian newsletter. Neither are scholarly sources and both are, again, explicitly confessional in nature. I think WP:BIASED may on point in a highly sensitive issue touching on the wider disputes about Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust. Do we know what the Samerski book says, for example? —Brigade Piron (talk) 08:55, 17 October 2021 (UTC) Buidhe It is true that the sources cover Catholic issues, but only the Salvatorian one is actually published by a Catholic institution. I need not go into how varied Catholic newspapers are in their adherence/faithfulness to the Catholic hierarchy and beliefs (see e.g. National Catholic Reporter versus National Catholic Register). But more direclty, there actually are many scholarly RS that discussion Pfeiffer and his works in Nazi-occupied Rome. You will find them on the other language versions of this article. The problem is that I do not read Italian or German well enough to use them in the article. Coverage is not the issue. It is English language coverage. Ergo Sum 13:48, 17 October 2021 (UTC) @Ergo Sum: perhaps add the word "reportedly" before "saved". I'm inclined to accept in good faith the sources used as reliable – none of them have not been deprecated nor deemed generally unreliable. —Bloom6132 (talk) 16:41, 26 October 2021 (UTC) DYK should not cover unconfirmed reports or rumors so I strongly disagree with that suggestion. As well as assuming sources are reliable if they've never been discussed at WP:RSN, which disregards important parts of WP:RS such as WP:CONTEXTMATTERS. There is no issue with citing sources in Italian or German, but if it's not confirmed that they support the content then it's incorrect to assume that they do. (t · c) buidhe 20:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Bloom6132: I tend to think that statements are either supported by RS and written in wikivoice or they're not accepted at all. For that reason, I shy away from words like "reportedly." I reiterate though that I think it's quite clear there's nothing wrong with the sources currently used. They're all RS, so that should be the end of it. Hence, why I think your initial review was satisfactory. Ergo Sum 23:40, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Ergo Sum: agreed. I'm still of the view that the hook satisfies criteria 3b. Criteria 4 states that "Nominations should be rejected if an inspection reveals that they are not based on reliable sources". That is not the case here. —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) You're still ignoring the principle in RS that context matters, and some sources are reliable for some but not other info. The two of us who actually write on Holocaust related topics have expressed that the sources cited are not reliable for the exceptional claims being made. (t · c) buidhe 23:59, 26 October 2021 (UTC) With all due respect, I am of the opinion that the sources used are reliable for the info in the hook. The fact that you and Brigade Piron write on Holocaust-related topics is irrelevant – it does not confer a veto over hooks pertaining to that subject. By that logic, I should be able to veto baseball or heraldry hooks ... —Bloom6132 (talk) 01:10, 27 October 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: Three of my DYKs promoted (including Coat of arms of the Falkland Islands from August this year) have included the word "reportedly" in the hook, as well as numerous hooks from other editors. Disagree all you want – this is accepted practice at DYK. —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: I'm aware that you have experience writing about Holocaust-related articles and I put value in your assessment as a solid editor. However, I'm quite comfortable in my ability to vet RS, as well, and my confidence in these sources means I must disagree with your opinion here. Experienced editors do disagree at times, and it is my opinion that I think you have gotten this one wrong; doubtless, you think the same for me. I haven't seen any evidence that these are not RS. Therefore, I recommend if Bloom6132 is inclined to do so, to renew their approval of the hook. In the meantime, I'm going to request the input of additional experienced editors on the DYK talk page. Ergo Sum 01:28, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm going to ping @Bamse, Bermicourt, Jmabel, and Anyfile to see if we can find some reliable sources in other languages. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 01:46, 27 October 2021 (UTC) Oops, @AnyFile theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 01:47, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm currently traveling & very busy, so not much help here, I'm afraid. - Jmabel | Talk 01:53, 27 October 2021 (UTC) That said, more or less this same case is made in The Pope's Jews: The Vatican's Secret Plan to Save Jews from the Nazis by Gordon Thomas (not currently cited in the article). - Jmabel | Talk 02:00, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm unclear as to why the cited sources are unreliable: are we assuming that all information emanating from a Roman Catholic source is unreliable? If so what's the logic? In any case there are dozens of book sources in English, German, French and Italian that mention Pfeiffer, the problem is that few are accessible online. One is an entire biography of Pfeiffer "from baker to Vatican diplomat" which would be useful to track down: Willer, Philomena (2005). P. Pankratius Pfeiffer SDS: (1872-1945); vom Bäckergesellen zum Vatikandiplomat. Pub: Josef Fink. Others that mentions Pfeiffer and the Jews in Rome are: Liebhart (1996) Schwangau. Meding (1992), Flucht vor Nürnberg. Sinn (1976), Illegal. Bermicourt (talk) 08:41, 27 October 2021 (UTC) My issue is with the unreliability of journalistic works and popular history, which have in many cases published inaccurate information about rescues of Jews during the Holocaust. If better sources exist, they should be cited instead. An additional question is, do these sources actually support the claim of "hundreds" of Jews rescued by Pfeiffer personally? (t · c) buidhe 08:51, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I've now found sources that cover most of the article. Here are more: Liebhart (1996) Schwangau. Meding (1992), Flucht vor Nürnberg. Sinn (1976), Illegal. Prince Constantine of Bavaria (1952) Der Papst. Layer (1985), Schwäbisches Ehrenbuch - Pfeiffer credited with "saving Rome and other Italian cities including Chieti, Ascoli and Ovieto from destruction and other calamities" _ (1999). Publik-Forum - Pfeiffer the only German to have a street named after him in Rome and who fought to save Roman Jews. _ (1960). Bayerische Frömmigkeit - Pfeiffer described as the "Saviour of Rome and other cities in Italy" Robert Katz has written a number of books - Death in Rome (1967), Black Sabbath (1969), The Battle for Rome (2010) - which all mention Pfeiffer. Bottum and Dalin (2004). The Pius War has this interesting piece: "7. Pancrazio [sic] Pfeiffer. According to Carroll-Abbing, one of the men used by Pius XII to protest the Nazi roundup of Rome's Jews and intervene for persecuted victims was Father Pancrazio Pfeiffer, superior general of the Salvatorian Fathers, who also served as Pius XII' personal liaison to the German military command in Rome. Because Pfeiffer died tragically in an automobile accident toward the end of the war and thus never took part in the postwar analysis of Pius XII's conduct, many historians have overlooked him. But those who knew him or have researched his life have chronicled his collaborative efforts with Pius XII to rescue Jews and others during the war. See the article "Pfeiffer's List" by Robert Graham, 30 Days, June 1994, pp. 42-46. Prince Constantine of Bavaria's book on Pius XII, The Pope (London: Allan Wingate, 1954) [listed above] contains an excellent section on Pfeiffer, whom he describes as an agent for the pope on behalf of the victims of persecution and the fugitives in hiding" (p. 213). At Pfeiffer's death in May 1945, Vatican Radio paid tribute: "He came into contact with the Commander of the German occupying forces [in Rome in 1943-44]. From that day onwards, he placed his religious and spiritual qualities at the service of many who had been arrested or already condemned to death. He helped countless people in this way, and saved their lives, among them many Jews and other Italian personages. He championed..." In short there seems to be book evidence for virtually everything stated in the article apart from the specific details of the two incidents where 249 or 400 Jews were rescued. Based on my initial searches my expectation is that those incidents are likely to be recorded in the literature - we just need to be able to access more of the sources. Meanwhile there is no harm in pausing to use some of the above sources, plus those I've added to the Further reading section of the article in order to reinforce the existing references and then review where we are. Bermicourt (talk) 08:41, 27 October 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: thoughts? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 07:09, 4 November 2021 (UTC) I don't think the article currently meets DYK requirements. For example, Salvatorians USA Province is not independent of the article subject and therefore is not reliable for self-serving assertions such as "he saved many Jews in Rome from persecution and ultimately death" or "Every day, Pfeiffer visited the Regina Coeli prison and another prison on Via Tasso, where he would often return with freed prisoners who had been sentenced to death." (t · c) buidhe 08:27, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: would you still object if the article instead relied on the sources found by Bermicourt? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 04:58, 5 November 2021 (UTC) Depends, the Samerski source looks reliable to me but the book published by "Österreichische Provinz der Salvatorianer" has the same issue of close connection to the article subject. (t · c) buidhe 06:27, 5 November 2021 (UTC) All right. @Ergo Sum: I'm not going to promote the nomination without consensus to move forward, so if you want to try and rework the article's sourcing to approval, that can work. If you're not, this nomination should probably stop here. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 19:57, 5 November 2021 (UTC) @Ergo Sum: If the issue isn't addressed in a week, I think the best option is to reject this nomination. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 19:29, 10 November 2021 (UTC) Unfortunately, I have had to push this to the back burner.

This slipped my mind completely this weekend. I will deal with this tonight. Ergo Sum 15:45, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I have added several inline citations to the article, which refer to sources that were (very helpfully) added by Bermicourt. These sources support several of the very specific claims in the article, as well as the general thrust of the article which is in dispute here, namely that Pfeiffer was a liaison and in that capacity saved many Jews and others from the Nazis. In light of these reliable sources supporting the general claims, I think any concern about the pre-existing ones describing some of his more specific actions is ameliorated. There is a trove of additional sources in the Further Reading section that additionally describe in much greater detail Pfeiffer's actions but they are either in a foreign language which I do not adequately read to make use of as citations or are offline. All being said, I think there is now ample sourcing to back up the article's claims. Ergo Sum 05:49, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks, Ergo Sum—@Buidhe:, if this sourcing is up to your standards, we can move ahead. If not, we're probably going back to WT:DYK and asking for more eyes. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 05:52, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Hi, I've flagged the specific content in the article that supports the hook as needing a better source. There are other active cleanup tags on the article as well. However, I think there's sufficient sourcing for a modified version of the hook without the words "hundreds of". (t · c) buidhe 06:06, 17 November 2021 (UTC) We could cite "countless" using the ref above instead of "hundreds of". Bermicourt (talk) 08:33, 17 November 2021 (UTC) According to the source it's what Vatican Radio said about him after his death. DYK is not for eulogies imo. (t · c) buidhe 08:37, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I'm not following—is the source unreliable because it's after his death? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 08:40, 17 November 2021 (UTC) No, it's because it's Catholic presumably... We could always add "according to Vatican Radio..." But better still, we just need to cite the exact text from one of the many non-Catholic book sources and the problem will be solved. Bermicourt (talk) 08:46, 17 November 2021 (UTC) And yet another source: O'Reilly (2001) in Forgotten Battles: Italy's War of Liberation 1943-45 states that "the Vatican was able to assist many of Rome's Jews and others sought by the Germans through Father Pancrazio Pfeiffer's intervention with the Germans... His work was recounted by Robert Graham who has written extensively on the Vatican's role in World War II." Bermicourt (talk) 09:01, 17 November 2021 (UTC) And another: Bartley (2016) in Catholics Confronting Hitler states that "Father Pancrace [sic] Pfeiffer, a German priest and the superior general of the Salvatorian Order, was the pope's liaison with the German military. Several hundred hostages, including some under sentence of death, owed their release to the efficacious intervention of Father Pfeiffer." I don't know why I'm doing this - you can look up the references yourselves instead of opining and speculating from the sidelines in the classic Wikipedia way. :) Bermicourt (talk) 09:08, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @Bermicourt: Since it seems you have access to several sources that I do not (probably just requires further digging), would you want to add them as inline citations with page numbers, especially to support the proposition regarding hundreds of people saved?

I'd be in favor instead of the hook being split into two separate proposals: one hook about the fact that she was an internet celebrity who grew up in a place without tap water, and a separate hook about her going viral for making hamburgers. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:23, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Full review needed, which can also address the issue of the borderline ALT1 hook. BlueMoonset (talk) 04:23, 5 November 2021 (UTC) As far as I can tell the article meets DYK requirements, and a QPQ has been done. Earwigs finds a close match with Coda Media, but that's only because it was the source for quotes in the article, and all of them are properly referenced. I find the first hook hard to believe given China's international standing, and in any case as brought up by Bowlhover may be inaccurate anyway. As for the second hook, as I mentioned before it's ineligible as it's exactly 200 characters long, and per WP:DYK hooks that are at or shorter than 200 characters may be rejected per reviewer's discretion. Both ALT0 and ALT1 have struck: I am repeating my earlier suggestion that ALT1 instead be split into two separate hooks. As this is a China-related article and there appear to be some political discussion in the article, I'd also like to ask for a second opinion from someone more knowledgeable about China-related articles if the article doesn't fall afoul of relevant guidelines. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 13:12, 6 November 2021 (UTC) From Wikipedia:Did you know#The hook: The hook should be concise: no more than about 200 characters (including spaces and the question mark, but not including the ..., the space immediately following the ..., or any (pictured)). While 200 is a hard limit, hooks near or at this limit may still be rejected at the discretion of reviewers and administrators. This tool can be used for counting words. The guideline says that "200 is a hard limit", so it is not true that the 200-character ALT1 hook is "ineligible" or "simply too long". No reason has been given for rejecting a 200-character hook "at the discretion of reviewers". Here are two additional hooks based on the suggestion: ALT2: ... that Dianxi Xiaoge, who grew up in a remote Yunnan mountain without running water, is an Internet celebrity with roughly 16 million subscribers on all her platforms? ALT3: ... Dianxi Xiaoge went viral in China and internationally after making hamburgers for her grandparents who had never eaten them before? Cunard (talk) 07:48, 7 November 2021 (UTC) Well for one thing, the original was very difficult to read and seemed to combine too many facts into one hook. Usually DYK prefers simpler hooks whenever possible. In any case, I think ALT3 is the best hook here and the nomination is otherwise good to go, I'd just like to hear a second opinion from another editor on the article tone given that I'm a bit uncomfortable doing a solo review here given the "Commentary" section delves into some political matters. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:36, 7 November 2021 (UTC) On second thought, I have some concerns regarding the length of the article. Isn't it rather detailed for an internet celebrity's page? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 11:10, 7 November 2021 (UTC) That the article is "rather detailed for an internet celebrity's page" should not be a concern. The sources provided substantial analysis of her and her work, and this article reflects those sources. Other detailed articles for Internet celebrities include PewDiePie and MrBeast. Cunard (talk) 11:18, 7 November 2021 (UTC) Pinging Gatoclass for his input, as he responded to a discussion I raised about this nomination over at WT:DYK. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:57, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I don't think we need Gatoclass to restate themself. Here's what they said at WT:DYK: The article doesn't use the phrase "one of only three Chinese influencers to gain international influence", so I'm not sure where you got that, but it does say she is one of only three "Chinese Internet celebrities who have reached international prominence", and the problem with that claim is that it's sourced to an article that is two years old and therefore not up-to-date. With regard to the overall length, I would agree that it is overly detailed and could use a trim. I'm not sure this is relevant to DYK however, as "overly detailed" is not one of our criteria. What I would say is that the level of detail does raise the chances of close paraphrasing so the article would need to be carefully checked for that. Anybody else with an opinion on this article?

My reasoning here is that if the hook were read as plaintext, without any bolding or linking, it would be read as pretty much only interesting as it concerns the plot. The hook should concern Smit's life; if it concerns her work as an actress, only stating her role and not anything about production doesn't make the hook out-of-universe. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 21:28, 17 November 2021 (UTC) theleekycauldron, I was taking a look at the ALT1 hook and its sources, and the second Biography sentence is basically copied from Esquire—the Google translate version, at any rate. That's a problem. Another problem is that the source doesn't actually say that she was working as a hotel receptionist when she got the call, just that it was "one of these jobs", referring back to the four in the previous sentence, none of which were hotel receptionist. The article also needs a bit of copyediting. I don't think that either of the plot-based hooks should be used, and as Drmies notes, "first film" is not accurate, since it's Cross the Line that's in the source, which appears to be her fifth film. We could only use "first feature film" if the previous four in her filmography were all short films (which would need to be clearly sourced). Perhaps an angle for the information in ALT1 would be to say she was working in whatever job it was when she was cast in Cross the Line, for which she was nominated as best new actress in the Goya Awards. BlueMoonset (talk) 02:31, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Here’s an article that states she was working as a receptionist two years before she was hired to work on Parallel Mothers:[6] Does it appear reliable? Thriley (talk) 05:38, 20 November 2021 (UTC) I don't see a reason to doubt the source. However, it isn't sufficient to support the "when she was called" hook claim, just that she was a hotel receptionist two years before the article was written (and possibly two years and a number of months, since you can't assume it's exactly two years). BlueMoonset (talk) 17:14, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Perhaps the hook should include all her various jobs before her Almodovar role? Thriley (talk) 01:47, 23 November 2021 (UTC) ALT3 “before starring in the Pedro Almodóvar film Parallel Mothers, Milena Smit worked as a model, waitress, shop assistant, babysitter, teleoperator, subway information assistant, and hotel receptionist?” El País Thriley (talk) 01:51, 23 November 2021 (UTC) That hook is 197 characters which puts it in discretionary territory. Given though that the hookiness here is that she did all of these non-acting jobs, I think in this case the length is justified since it hasn't reached the limit. I say ALT3 is pretty good and can be approved.

Should "instriptions" (before the Drusus heading) be "inscriptions"? Should the names of scholars be wikilinked, where there is a page for the author (e.g. Simek)?

To be expected, since they're cited almost 20 times each, and since the vast majority of the matches concern long quotes I'm willing to overlook it, but can we add more citations throughout the paragraphs? Particularly with "Conflict with Miles and Reynolds", there's four citations crammed at the end of the section. I think we should cite each after the corresponding sentences, especially where there's a direct quotation. Also for ALT0 we need a citation at the ends of the sentences for "Golden Boy" and "Whiz Kid". Otherwise nice read, and good use of sources.

Its long enough and new and lots of good refs - including the hook fact. It documents a notable woman from the 14th century and there were not many of those.

Nice addition. well done Victuallers (talk) 10:31, 6 November 2021 (UTC) Reopening this because I think the hook is misleading, as according to the source it was usual for women of the nobility, like Neville, to sign with their own names. Gatoclass (talk) 02:10, 19 November 2021 (UTC) @Gatoclass: I don't think most will know that, so maybe we go with ALT1 or some variation on it? We don't need to say it's unusual if we phrase it that way theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 02:14, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Theleekycauldron, the problem with both hooks is that they imply that there was something out-of-the-ordinary in a woman signing something in her own name in that era, whereas the source indicates that was normal practice for women of the nobility. So the hooks are misleading. Gatoclass (talk) 02:19, 19 November 2021 (UTC) All right—I'll ping @Lajmmoore and Victuallers: back here, y'all can work this out. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 02:33, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Was it usual for women in the fourteenth century to sign with their own name ... no. Is is usual for women in the 21st century to sign with just their first name? No. So "did you know that unusually Canada's head of state signs documents with just her first name and an R for Regina?" (Someone shouts) "BUT all British Queens do that!!" (Someone shouts) "That implies that it was unusual for Queens to sign with just their first name." No it doesnt. I think @Gatoclass: is reading the source and then saying that the hook doesnt explain every piece of information in the source... which obviously it doesnt. Its unusual that "a woman" is doing this at all. It WAS unusual for women in the fourteenth century to sign and if they did then they did not usually use just their own name. Its a fact - its unusual. Did You know that women did not sign their own names on documents in the 14th century? No I didnt. That is something that Lajmmoore wrote about and now I know. Thanks. Victuallers (talk) 08:28, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Hello Gatoclass all so the part of the source I was using is this, which is talking about signatures for charitable donation "Although most of the widows declare themselves to be the wife of their late husband, or their father's daughter, others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names, such as 'domina Margareta de Longvl' and 'don-ýina Margareta de Nevill' (the same person). The majority of widows declare that their marital status and their power to act, using a variety of phrases, including 'in pura viduitate', 'in pura viduitate mea et ligia potestate', and 'in viduitate mea propria et potestate legitima' ..." and I read that as it was more usual for (noble) women to use a signature that described them as "wife of, etc..." I read the passage as Legg using Margaret de Neville as an unusual example. Legg is talking about the Coucher Book signatures specifically, but I still think they are marking out unusual practice. In terms of the hook, I wonder whether changing 'woman' to 'literate woman' might work? Lajmmoore (talk) 09:32, 19 November 2021 (UTC) No, it wouldn't work just to add "literate". And your reading of the text just amounts to an unsupported assumption on your part. Because while the text could admittedly be less ambiguous, the statement that others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names does not in any way suggest that it was rare or unusual for a member of the nobility to give their name, it only states that members of the nobility as a class were inclined to give their names. So there isn't sufficient support in that statement for a hook which implies that Neville's act was in any way unusual for a member of her class. The hook makes Neville sound like some sort of proto-feminist who boldly challenged the system, when the underlying source only indicates that either her entire class did the same thing, or at least that it was an accepted practice for members of the nobility. So I still think that either the hook needs to be substantially reworked to more closely reflect the source, or a new hook be found. Gatoclass (talk) 02:53, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks for sharing your interpretation of your text Gatoclass. My interpretation (& so the hook) is based on Legg's use of the word most - in that "most of the widows declare themselves to be the wife of their late husband, or their father's daughter" and you rightly point out "others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names" but I think that needs to be balanced by the "most" earlier in the sentence i.e. for women generally, they don't give their name, but some noble women do but overall, for women signing their name, it is unusual enough to be pointed out in the text.

Whispyhistory (talk) 06:32, 13 November 2021 (UTC) I don't see that exact sequence of numbers in the source, although there are others that look a bit like an IP address. The trouble is, the nominator seems to be the source for it looking a bit like an IP address, which it does, but we can't use that unless the source makes a similar point, which it does not appear to do.

I don't see how the hook you're suggesting is hooky. What exactly is wrong with the hook proposed? It's in the article and it's supported by the sources cited. And the image is directly related to the hook. It engages the reader into a spotting game. Dr. Vogel (talk) 14:57, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Like everyone else, I rather like the IP-address hook. If we wikilinked IP address, it would be supported in the linked articles, and fulfill the requirement that anyone following the links will be able to verify the hook. I don't think we need sourcing that says that a specific sequence of numbers is an IP address, as we have sources giving the general format of an IP address, and creating an example would be a trivial calculation ("Are all four of these numbers separated by periods in the range 0-255?"): "IPv4 and IPv6 address formats". www.ibm.com. An IPv4 address has the following format: x . x . x . x where x is called an octet and must be a decimal value between 0 and 255. Octets are separated by periods. An IPv4 address must contain three periods and four octets. The following examples are valid IPv4 addresses: 1 . 2 . 3 . 4 01 . 102 . 103 . 104 This hook is better than any alternative I can think of, and I don't see anything likely to be problematic about it (it's certainly verifiable). I think we might be in agreement on that? So if some rule technically prohibits it, we might have a good case for applying the WP:Ignore all the rules policy. Broken finger is also currently DYK-eligible and I think it uses the same numbering scheme.[1] HLHJ (talk) 02:07, 14 November 2021 (UTC) [edit: add fulltext url] I don't necessarily agree with the reading of WP:DYKCRIT 3b ( Each fact in the hook must be supported in the article by at least one inline citation to a reliable source [...]) that says that the IP thing needs to be in the article (compare e.g. Template:Did you know nominations/Urine deflector, which similarly took some creative licence in how the proposed hooks were phrased beyond what was stated in either the article or the cited source), and I agree with HLHJ that WP:IAR would be applicable regardless. As for the hooks themselves, writing "a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone may be described as 88.5.3.2" is a much poorer way of writing the hook (less "hooky") than the converse, i.e. "88.5.3.2 may refer to a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone". TompaDompa (talk) 11:28, 14 November 2021 (UTC) This. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 17:01, 16 November 2021 (UTC) We can't use IP address because the nominator just thought it up "oh, that looks like an IP address". It's not in the source as the nominator admits and therefore is not verifiable. And so what if it does look like an IP address? What does that tell us about broken toes? I like clever or quirky hooks and have written many (if I may say so), but they have to be based on something in the sources otherwise it's things made up one day. Philafrenzy (talk) 10:19, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you for all your comments. This is not the place to ignore all rules. The proposed hook is not supported by the source given in the article. I am inclined to approve ALT1 but it needs checking, unless another hook is proposed. Whispyhistory (talk) 15:11, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Oh dear, this has become contentious. I think the contended question is whether it's acceptable to have verified information not found in the nominated article, but only in another article, linked in the hook. Not as hooky, but for illustration: ALT3 ... that the dot-decimal notation string "88.5.3.2" is not only an an IPv4 address, but also a fracture in the middle of the bone at the tip of the little toe? "IPv4 and IPv6 address formats". www.ibm.com., Hallux proximal phalanx fracture in adults: an overlooked diagnosis I don't think we're debating whether the IP-address-hook statement is verifiable. The statement that "88.5.3.2" (and any number in that format) is a valid IPv4 address is supported by the IP address article and the IPv4 article, and this format is the subject of the Dot-decimal notation article. No-one had bothered to cite those statements in those articles, but since they've been challenged here, I've now cited them. So "88.5.3.2 is both an IP address[1] and a code for a broken toebone[2]" is certainly verifiable, and is now verified on Wikipedia. Any DYK reader should have no trouble verifying that the hook is accurate. Alternatives that do not mention IP addressees are not as hooky, but don't contain more information about broken toes: ALT4 ... that "88.5.3.2" is a toe fracture in the middle of the bone at the tip of the little toe, while a "78.5.3.2" is the parallel broken finger?

Philafrenzy (talk) 19:25, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you Philafrenzy ( a very experienced DYK contributor) for your efforts in helping new editors understand DYK. Your comment higher up about "88.5.3.2" and "ip address" not being in the source is true and I am grateful for your suggested alts. Essentially, the initial and subsequent hooks sound good, but none are in the article or the source. I don't wish for personal comments and don't mind if someone else wishes to take over here. With due respect @DrVogel: and @HLHJ:...You may wish to take this up at Wikipedia talk:Did you know. Whispyhistory (talk) 10:41, 15 November 2021 (UTC) I won't say I wish I hadn't written the article; I hope it's useful enough to make up for the social harm to the project here. I don't think the hostility was intended by anyone; I suspect that it's felt partly due to the ease of mininterpretation in a text-only medium and partly due to human cognitive biases.[2] I certainly did, and do, not intend it. I spent a day's editing trying to resolve the conflict by finding references specifically saying that the two things were in notation X and adding that text to the article, but unfortunately non-inductive descriptions of the notations seem to have been considered so needless that an Internet RFC attempting to formalize them died of disinterest. I did find a source that explicitly defines the IPv4 format, and one that explicitly says that 88.1.2.2 is a specific fracture, and I've cited the latter in the article, but I don't think this helps. It is probably a bit unreasonable to expect a reviewer to do more than apply rules as best they can, and Wikipedia talk:Did you know might indeed be a better forum for a more detailed discussion. I don't really want to take part in one, though (nothing to do with this discussion, prior reasons). I posted because I felt responsible for the conflict and thought I might be able to help. My impression is that I made it worse; my apologies to everyone I've offended. HLHJ (talk) 03:41, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Nobody is offended, but if I may say so I think you are still missing the point. IP addresses have nothing to do with broken toes even if that notation may have a similarity. That's why the sources don't make the comparison and why the IP-based hooks are no good. Any of the other hooks might be fine (I haven't checked the numbers) just without the bit about IP addresses. The whole thing reminds me of unusually shaped vegetables where you may see a carrot shaped like a foot, people who see faces in clouds, and even apophenia. My personal observation that one thing looks a bit like another is not the basis for a hook unless reliable sources make the point too. Philafrenzy (talk) 09:09, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Folks, we are wasting a wonderful hook. Really. IP addresses have nothing to do with broken toes even if that notation may have a similarity and that is the whole point of making good hooks. They are supposed to be short, punchy, catchy, and likely to draw the readers in to wanting to read the article – as long as they don't misstate the article content. And one of the best recipes to make a hook good is to make it sound counterintuitive With any other option but the original, we are bound to receive another hook frequented by maybe a few hundred visitors. I would propose something to the tune of in some contexts, 88.5.3.2 might not mean an IP address but a broken bone in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone? so that no one claims here that we somehow delegitimise the IP address but at the same time so that we preserve the core of the hook. As for the claims that because the hook is not cited in the IP part, it can't be there - please don't be that pedantic. In our today's world of informatics we may assume that people who visit Wikipedia more or less imagine what IP addresses are, and may more or less imagine how they look like (in the worst case they will visit the article for details). The other part is cited. I see no problem with the original. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 17:01, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Szmenderowiecki I admit that I'm not very familiar with the topic, and the above discussion was confusing, but is the "this isn't an IP address" claim actually in the source? Because if it's not, then no matter how good the hook proposal is, it can't be used in a hook since hook facts need to be based on a reference. Also, I'm pretty sure that assumptions don't count as sources. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:31, 17 November 2021 (UTC) What I was leading is that we don't need to cite that the sky is blue, or that we have five fingers; or that there exist IP addresses for that matter. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 11:08, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Given that these IP number hooks aren't working out so far, I wonder if some other hooks unrelated to that could be proposed here. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 02:11, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Comment only If we accept the first hook we will end up with thousands of hits, some quiet smiles and some who will continue to believe that DYK broke the rules. We're allowed to. This is not a massive occasion where we can save the whole project by breaking the rules. Its a trivial example of what some (not all) think may be a breach in the rules, with a small, but amusing, advantage. So I'm not asking the defenders of the rules to admit that this is not a breech ... I am suggesting that they might just concede that the harm done by allowing this hook might not offend anyone ... and it might please a few thousand. Victuallers (talk) 15:28, 20 November 2021 (UTC) We don't need to break the rules. The observation that the notation looks a bit like an IP address is trivial and completely unrelated to broken toes. There are already perfectly good hooks above that work better. Nobody is saying don't use the numbers, just strike the bit about IP addresses. The originally proposed hook is not the work of comic genius and cleverness that some seem to think it is. Philafrenzy (talk) 21:58, 20 November 2021 (UTC) The main issue here is that it's one of the core rules of DYK that hook facts must be mentioned in the article, ideally explicitly or at least implied by supporting information. The thing is that at the moment, IP addresses are not mentioned anywhere in the article, so the hooks using the IP address angle would be ineligible according to that criterion anyway. Even April Fools hooks, which tend to be misleading, are still generally based on hook facts that are mentioned in the respective articles. So if we can't even grant IAR exemptions for that criterion for AFD hooks, the one day of the year where our hooks tend to follow the rules most loosely, I can't see why such a request should be granted here.

Nominated by Victuallers (talk) at 16:21, 6 November 2021 (UTC). Article is new enough. Two correct writers are credited. The article is fully referenced. No copyvio detected. There is a bit of biased POV pushing in Wikipedia voice: "most vulnerable to climate change". This will be something our subject is saying no doubt. And this idea is also reflected in the hook with "endangered". The hook content is referenced and confirmed by the Guardian, apart from the "endangered" bit, which opinion is attributed to Tina Stege. So I suggest that "endangered" is taken out of the hook, or it is reworded so it is clear she is saying that. Hook alt1 is unsuitable as it does not link the article and I cannot tell what it is trying to say in relation to the subject. I can confirm image is CC-BY-3.0 as derived from the video with CC-BY-3.0 license. However I would suggest that a different image is selected from the video, perhaps near the end where the microphone is not obscuring her chin. QPQ is done. Graeme Bartlett (talk) 06:03, 15 November 2021 (UTC) @Graeme Bartlett: Thanks for the review Graeme - I have recut a new image. Surprised that "endangered" wasn't referenced.

Graeme Bartlett (talk) 20:56, 22 November 2021 (UTC) @Graeme Bartlett: Are you suggesting that we imply that "endangered" is her opinion despite the fact that she represents a nation and the "endangered" aspect is supported by the World Bank and the Guardian newspaper (and the 1bn people estimated to be part of the "High Ambition" group ) saying so? Is there any evidence that is just her opinion and not that of her country and the World Bank? Am I missing something? It you feel you need to give this "a cross" then can I suggest that we ask for a new reviewer?I have suggested an alt that does not use the endangered word.

Self-nominated at 23:51, 4 November 2021 (UTC). @DferDaisy: This article is about 3300 bytes, and was nominated for DYK shortly after creation, satisfying date and length criteria. There is a factual error, as the article states she was interred in Keokuk, Illinois, but the source says she died in Chicago, Illinois and was interred in Keokuk, Iowa. I am assuming good faith for a few references I cannot access (for example, ref 15 - The National Humane Review), which for me gives a landing page for the document, instead of an inside view). Otherwise, everything is properly sourced and there are no copyvio or close paraphrasing concerns (Earwig cites 3 potential problems, but they are not an issue here.) QPQ not required. Regarding the hooks, ALT0 is incorrect as stated, as it reads as if the study was conducted in the early 1900s by Meigs Crowder, whereas she published it in 1917 based on studies from that period. It'll need minor alteration. ALT1 is fine and sourced. I would prefer to promote an amended ALT0. A minor quibble, though not an issue for DYK: please add page numbers for cited sources. If online access is eliminated from the sources, it'll force anyone investigating those sources to wade through too many pages to find the desired detail.

AleatoryPonderings (???) (!!!) 01:52, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @AleatoryPonderings: Yes, but note that this court case is the "leading case with respect to the issue of common employers", establishing a precedent in Canadian law. At the time the lawsuit was filed, this was not the case, and in fact the trial judge ruled against Alouche (see last paragraph of background section); it was only after the case was brought to the Court of Appeal for Ontario that the "common employer doctrine" was established, and it became entrenched when leave to appeal the decision at the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed. Mindmatrix 15:11, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Ah, so the idea behind the hook is that, since Downtown Eatery changed the law on common employers, before Downtown Eatery Best Beaver would not have been Alouche's employer? That makes more sense. AleatoryPonderings (???) (!!!) 15:20, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: I'm going to inspect this again... Mindmatrix 15:18, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @AleatoryPonderings: Alright, so to ensure everything is correct, the following timeline occurred: Alouche was hired to be manager at For Your Eyes Only (owned by Grad and Grosman), and began work on 29 December 1992 Alouche was sent a Notice of Discipline in May 1993, and was fired on 15 June 1993 In October 1993, Alouche filed action for wrongful dismissal against Best Beaver Management Inc., as that was the source of his paycheques Best Beaver ceased operations in mid-1996, and all assets distributed to other companies owned by Grad and Grosman The trial resolved in favour of Alouche Best Beaver did not pay out the judgement (all its assets had been redistributed) Sherriffs were dispatched to For Your Eyes Only, where they seized $1,855 Downtown Eatery filed claim against Alouche, stating the cash belonged to it Alouche defended, and counterclaimed against Grad, Grosman, and all companies they controlled on the grounds of common employer doctrine, the oppression remedy of the Ontario Business Corporations Act, and fraudulent conveyance the judge in the second trial (at Ontario Superior Court of Justice) ruled against Alouche the case was brought to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, where the previous ruling was overturned in 2001 in January 2002, an application for leave to appeal the decision at the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed So, the common employer doctrine was part of the second trial as a counterclaim to the suit filed by Downtown Eatery. I just wanted to ensure this satisfies your concerns. Mindmatrix 18:25, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks for this incredibly thorough response. My concern is maybe philosophical or definitional. If I say that company A employs person B, that has an ordinary meaning and a legal meaning. It is probably right that Best Beaver did not employ Alouche in the ordinary sense of "employ", because Best Beaver was a "paymaster" and not the name on the front of the building where he went to work. My reading of the case itself is that, before Downtown Eatery, it was at best indeterminate as a legal matter whether Best Beaver, alone or in combination with its affiliate companies, employed Alouche. After Downtown Eatery, it was established—as a matter of legal meaning, but not necessarily ordinary meaning—that Best Beaver was his employer, or part of his employer, or something like that. The reason I brought this up is that it's not clear how one could verify the claim that "Best Beaver was not Alouche's employer", because that claim might be true as a matter of ordinary meaning but the only authoritative legal ruling we have on this (namely, Downtown Eatery) holds that the claim is false. In any event, I'll leave this to the eventual reviewer to sort out. I find my brain twisting into knots. AleatoryPonderings (???)

However, it includes a WP:IMDB source and I am unsure about the reliability of several other sources, including Film Ink, Queer Media Matters, Antaeus.org, Fern TV, Addicted to Horror Movies, Dan's Papers, Go Mag, Three Women in a Box and North Coast Rep. To add to that, the YouTube link does not appear to be uploaded by an official channel, making it unreliable. Additionally, per MOS:FILMCAST uncredited roles need a source. the copyvio checker showed up a 50%+ similarity with a source, which may suggest over quotation. On top of that, the subject has unclear notability. I'm unsure which roles are significant and The House on Pine Street appears to have a questionable notability. None of her awards seem significant and I'm not seeing any significant coverage from reliable, independent sources. ALT0 isn't very interesting given the festival is not significant enough to have an article. I think ALT1 is interesting but it seems to focus more on the character, not the actress which isn't exactly ideal... QPQ not needed. We'll need some work but we'll get there!

Source: 1 and 2 Comment: This is the first time I’ve ever made a DYK here, so here goes. I personally find this fact interesting because it highlights how the advent of YouTube, and internet fame in general, has allowed people to use their voice to reach people in positions of high influence, bringing hidden ideas to light and advocating for change. While this specific example falls under a video game/pop-culture category, and may not fit Wikipedia’s desire for academic material, I feel that this is interesting enough to share, as it’s one the gaming community can relate to, like with other social media trends such as #FreeSmash and "Rerelease Mother 3." As for the article itself, all of the citations should be reliable enough; they’re all from third-party/secondary source outlets and there isn’t any BLP violation to be found here. One concern I have is criteria #3 - “Each fact in the hook must be supported in the article by at least one inline citation to a reliable source, appearing no later than the end of the sentence(s) offering that fact. Citations at the end of the paragraph are not sufficient.” While the hook is sourced in the article, the refs are at the end of the section rather than per each sentence. I can fix that however. Anyway, I hope this fact does get accepted! If not, I understand, thanks for reviewing this anyway. Created/expanded by PantheonRadiance (talk). Self-nominated at 08:45, 17 November 2021 (UTC).

Article is new enough, very newsworthy event and hence well-sourced, no copyvios (Earwig reports a false positive on the Johnson quotation), QPQ done.

Newness requirement satisfied by 5x expansion on 11/15 from < 600 to > 3000 characters. Articles also long enough and compliant with core policies on citations and neutrality. The hook is in-line sourced. Photo has appropriate license. QPQ is done. There are, however, two problems: (1) There is some significant overlap with this source. To start, the following sentence is taken from the source without use of quotation marks and with no effort to paraphrase rather than use the precise words: "Local advocacy led to the establishment of Bridle Trails as a state park in 1932." Further, this sentence also strikes me as too closely drawn from the same source: "Initial park development dates to 1933 when Civil Works Administration employees and federal relief workers were employed in state parks as part of the New Deal program. Further work included burning logging debris, clearing brush and building trails and fences." Work needs to be done to put the material into your own words. (2) The hook strikes me as boring in that it states an obvious point. Horses having the right of way on this trail is not unique or special. On trails that are shared by humans and horses, it is the general rule that horses have the right of way. See here ("In general, horses always have the right of way, followed by hikers, then by bikers."). See also here ("For safety reasons, if you come across a horse and rider on any trail they always have right of way. Hikers and bike riders all yield to horses.")

For one, the quote is not actually "could have been made by aliens" so, considering this is all about misquotation, we should either use the actual quote or clarify that it is a misquotation. Then "as though it was a real announcement" implies that it was actually, I don't know, a fake announcement? A parody?

As far as I am aware, Queen Victoria never wore the Koh-i-Noor set in a necklace, though she did wear it set in a brooch and in a circlet (headdress). So the necklace with the Koh-i-Noor in this sculpture is probably artistic licence. Created by Storye book (talk). Self-nominated at 16:10, 17 November 2021 (UTC). Captivating storey of a life and career, meticulously referenced on plenty of fine sources, offline sources accepted AGF, no copyvio obvious. The image is licensed. The hook works, but I don't see the diamond in the image. I am willing to approve it but would like to discuss other options: mention the artistic license, because I didn't know the detail of her not wearing that gem in a necklace don't mention the diamond detail, focus on the jubilee, and use the second image from the gallery which show the greatness of the design better than the head detail base a hook on the Warrior/Youth work which I find much more attractive as an artwork, and as an image in small size ;) Let me know. Take that article to GA please, I think it's ready. - Graham87, can you please do the history merge for him? --Gerda Arendt (talk) 06:57, 18 November 2021 (UTC) @Gerda Arendt: I didn't do the history merge because it's not needed. Graham87 09:41, 18 November 2021 (UTC) @Gerda Arendt: Thank you for the review. Diamonds were often cut in cabochon style in the 19th century and earlier. This one was cut with a flat bottom like all cabochons, and when viewed from above, it was a large oval, about 1.5 inches long. Modern cabochons usually have a smoothly rounded surface; this one was lightly faceted but the facets don't show on the sculpture. So it looks like half an egg, I suppose. The Koh-i-Noor is the large oval at the bottom of the picture. We have no specific citation for artistic licence - that is just a conclusion that we can probably make, since we have no evidence that Victoria ever had it set in a necklace. Therefore I cannot use "artistic licence" in a hook or in the article. I'll have a go at a hook using a full-length Victoria, and another hook using the Warrior and Wounded Youth sculpture. I'll come back shortly with those.

As for the hooks, I'm going to reject ALT0 out of hand, because Ben Comeau can take a number on that one. I'm also going to say no to ALT1, not because it's uncivil or uninteresting, but because it should be quoted—I've suggested two minor alts. A QPQ is also needed. Let me know what you think—nice work! — Preceding unsigned comment added by Theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) 02:57, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Re 1a, I don't see how we know that Comeau personally thinks of Trump; these could have been works-for-hire, after all. I've been trying to come up with something catchy on this -- for example, had Comeau invited Trump to participate in a performance of the work, then we could say he told Trump to fugue himself -- but the sourcing just isn't there that I can see. In consolation, here's an enlightening bit of musical history you will want to share with friends and family: Q: Why did Bach have so many children?

EEng 16:47, 17 November 2021 (UTC) The video for "Boris Johnson is a Lying Shit" includes a description from Comeau that basically screams for people not to vote for him, and the one for "Donald Trump is a Wanker" says "As satisfying as it is to poke fun at the Orange Monster, this video on its own probably won’t do the teeniest thing to reduce the devastation inflicted by the Trump administration. I therefore want to use this platform to suggest ways we can contribute to meaningful anti-Trump resistance.". We'd need to flesh out the article with these WP:BLPPRIMARY sources for the "thinks" to be properly verifiable. Moving on, 1a and 1b don't have as much impact or quirkiness you can get with a good hook. I suppose 1b is factually correct, but it's not "Did you know that Trump is directly connected to Russia or that a Trump resort is directly connected to Moscow?

There is over-linking in the hook. Copyvio seems fine (ignoring the 90% violation, which is a website which copies Wikipedia) QPQ not required.

Source: several Reviewed: to come Created by Gerda Arendt (talk) and RandomCanadian (talk). Nominated by Gerda Arendt (talk) at 19:27, 21 November 2021 (UTC). I don't think this is ready for DYK. There's a lot of scholarship on this particular piece (to which I have access). I think it would be better if we waited. WP:NORUSH is a thing, and there's enough for me to expand this to something more reasonable once I'm not busy with end-of-term business IRL. Cheers, RandomCanadian (talk / contribs) 19:40, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Nomination couldn't wait another day - 7 days after creation. --Gerda Arendt (talk) 21:26, 21 November 2021 (UTC) @Gerda Arendt: The alternative path to DYK, which I assume you know too, is to expand this at a later point (possibly all the way to GA). I'm quite confident a more expanded article would be a more attractive thing to present to the reader (and there would be plenty of more interesting hooks. Did you know that a recently discovered 1692 libretto of an actual Abendmusik bears similarities to Wacht! Euch zum Streit?[1][2]. Or that the Abendmusiken were actually presented right after Vespers?[3] Vespers, which themselves lasted two or three hours, in addition to a further three or four hour Hauptgottesdienst in the morning?[4][5] That might be one of the reasons why the audience was reported to be so disorderly, to the point that the town watch had to be hired to maintain a semblance of order.[6] That, and a lot more, which would surely allow to take this to DYK at a later time, after having greatly expanded this. Or at least, it's my opinion that taking the sole opportunity for DYK now would be a waste when it can be done when the article is expanded and made into something significantly more attractive and informative.

This can't be approved without a qpq, - after nominating, there's time. --Gerda Arendt (talk) 23:34, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Because I'm busy IRL (as you can deduce from the fact of my lesser than usual activity)? Fact is, I have the score and the whole text (including in translation) with me, in addition to lots of critical commentary on the piece itself (too much of which is focused on the question of authenticity, but alas...) and on the Abendmusiken in general. This can be used to make a proper article, but it would require time, which at the moment I really need to put into meeting an actual deadline than here. I've given you a list of pertinent sources (many of which are in German, if that's easier for you), if you're interested you know where to ask. On top of all of that, there's the question of article title (should it be at the current one or at Wacht! Euch zum Streit gefasset macht (a title which is used in a fair amount of sources, too...) Cheers, RandomCanadian (talk / contribs) 00:01, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Short version of what I replied on my talk: The time for it is in Advent. This year or next, that is the question. I'm also busy with other things, and both your familiarity with the topic, and your better English, make me wish you did it. For DYK, just raising attention is the goal. If you want it GA, we probably better wait. You decide. --Gerda Arendt (talk) 07:50, 22 November 2021 (UTC) The title: Wikipedia goes by the common title, and the other (and probably more) should be redirects.

Overall: Article meets eligibility criteria. i.e newness and article length. Article is well sourced and is neutral in tone. Hook is interesting and is cited. Copyvio scores ~20% in major part due to a quote that has been attributed rightly. However, the nominator might want to consider removing the quote and rewriting the sentence because the original Nepal Times article does not have it as a quote and is likely a paraphrasing done by the newspaper to begin with. Hence, we should not include it as a quote. In addition, I would encourage the nominator to consider expanding the article - to be clear, the article is good to go as-is. But looking at Hanuman Dhoka for instance there is an opportunity to build this article more than just a "History" section. Handing it back to the nominator. Some work and this is ready for homepage.

Further information: Official supplementary guidelines and unofficial guide  Warning: You are not logged in. Please create an account or log in to proceed. Alternatively, you may leave a message at the bottom of the DYK project talk page with the article you would like to nominate and the hook you would like to propose.  Warning: The helper script only works on desktop. Please switch to desktop view to continue. Install the DYK helper script by adding the line {{subst:lusc|User:SD0001/DYK-helper.js}} to your common.js page. Go back to the article, and choose the "DYK" option from the "More" menu (see image). Fill in the form and submit it. Check back periodically to address comments or concerns from the reviewer (it may take several weeks). Manual instructions[edit] Create a subpage for your new DYK suggestion and then list the page below under the date the article was created or the expansion began or it became a good article (not the date you submit it here), with the newest dates at the bottom. Any registered user may nominate a DYK suggestion (if you are not a registered user, please leave a message at the bottom of the DYK project talk page with the details of the article you would like to nominate and the hook you would like to propose); self-nominations are permitted and encouraged. Thanks for participating and please remember to check back for comments on your nomination (consider watchlisting your nomination page). Read these instructions completely before proceeding. For simplified instructions, see User:Rjanag/Quick DYK 2. I. Create the nomination subpage. Enter the article title in the box below and click the button. (To nominate multiple articles together, enter any or all of the article titles.) You will then be taken to a preloaded nomination page. II. Write the nomination. On the nomination page, fill in the relevant information. See Template:NewDYKnomination and {{NewDYKnomination/guide}} for further information. Not every line of the template needs to be filled in. For instance, if you are not nominating an image to appear with your hook, there is no need to fill in the image-related lines. Add an edit summary e.g. "Nominating YOUR ARTICLE TITLE for DYK" and click Publish page. Make sure the nomination page is on your watchlist, so you can follow the review discussion. III. Post at Template talk:Did you know. In the current nominations section find the subsection for the date on which the article was created or on which expansion began (or, if a new Good Article, the date on which it became a GA), not the date on which you make the nomination. At the top of that subsection (before other nominations already there, but below the section head and hidden comment) add {{Did you know nominations/YOUR ARTICLE TITLE}}. Add an edit summary e.g. "Nominating YOUR ARTICLE TITLE for DYK" and click Publish page. Frequently asked questions[edit] How do I write an interesting hook? Successful hooks tend to have several traits. Most importantly, they share a surprising or intriguing fact. They give readers enough context to understand the hook, but leave enough out to make them want to learn more. They are written for a general audience who has no prior knowledge of or interest in the topic area. Lastly, they are concise, and do not attempt to cover multiple facts or present information about the subject beyond what's needed to understand the hook. When will my nomination be reviewed? This page is often backlogged. As long as your submission is still on the page, it will stay there until an editor reviews it. Since editors are encouraged to review the oldest submissions first, it may take several weeks until your submission is reviewed. In the meantime, please consider reviewing another submission (not your own) to help reduce the backlog (see instructions below). Where is my hook? If you can't find the nomination you submitted to this nominations page, it may have been approved and is on the approved nominations page waiting to be promoted. It could also have been added to one of the prep areas, promoted from prep to a queue, or is on the main page. If the nominated hook is in none of those places, then the nomination has probably been rejected. Such a rejection usually only occurs if it was at least a couple of weeks old and had unresolved issues for which any discussion had gone stale. If you think your nomination was unfairly rejected, you can query this on the DYK discussion page, but as a general rule such nominations will only be restored in exceptional circumstances. Instructions for reviewers[edit] Main page: Wikipedia:Did you know/Reviewing guide Any editor who was not involved in writing/expanding or nominating an article may review it by checking to see that the article meets all the DYK criteria (long enough, new enough, no serious editorial or content issues) and the hook is cited. Editors may also alter the suggested hook to improve it, suggest new hooks, or even lend a hand and make edits to the article to which the hook applies so that the hook is supported and accurate. For a more detailed discussion of the DYK rules and review process see the supplementary guidelines and the WP:Did you know/Reviewing guide. To post a comment or review on a DYK nomination, follow the steps outlined below: Look through this page, Template talk:Did you know, to find a nomination you would like to comment on. Click the "Review or comment" link at the top of the nomination. You will be taken to the nomination subpage. The top of the page includes a list of the DYK criteria. Check the article to ensure it meets all the relevant criteria. To indicate the result of the review (i.e., whether the nomination passes, fails, or needs some minor changes), leave a signed comment on the page. Please begin with one of the 5 review symbols that appear at the top of the edit screen, and then indicate all aspects of the article that you have reviewed; your comment should look something like the following: Article length and age are fine, no copyvio or plagiarism concerns, reliable sources are used. But the hook needs to be shortened. If you are the first person to comment on the nomination, there will be a line :* <!-- REPLACE THIS LINE TO WRITE FIRST COMMENT, KEEPING  :* --> showing you where you should put the comment. Save the page. If there is any problem or concern about a nomination, please consider notifying the nominator by placing {{subst:DYKproblem|Article|header=yes|sig=yes}} on the nominator's talk page. Instructions for project members[edit] How to promote an accepted hook[edit] At-a-glance instructions on how to promote an approved hook to a Prep area See Wikipedia:Did you know/Preparation areas for details on verifying a hook's acceptability. Promoters should not promote their own nomination or their own review When promoting hooks intended for a particular date, keep in mind that when the number of available approved nominations exceeds 120 we switch to two sets per day, and when that number drops below 60 we return to one set per day. Check list for nomination review completeness 1) Select a hook from the approved nominations page that has one of these ticks at the bottom post: . 2) Check to make sure basic review requirements were completed. a. Any outstanding issue following needs to be addressed before promoting. 3) Check the article history for any substantive changes since it was nominated or reviewed. 4) Images for the lead slot must be freely licensed. Fair-use images are not permitted. Images loaded on Commons that appear on the Main Page are automatically protected by KrinkleBot. 5) Hook must be stated in both the article and source (which must be cited at the end of the article sentence where stated). 6) Hook should make sense grammatically. 7) Try to vary subject matters within each prep area. 8) Try to select a funny, quirky or otherwise upbeat hook for the last or bottom hook in the set. Steps to add a hook to prep In one tab, open the nomination page of the hook you want to promote. In a second tab, open the prep set you intend to add the hook to. 1) For hooks held for specific dates, refer to "Local update times" section on DYK Queue. a. Completed Prep area number sets will be promoted by an administrator to corresponding Queue number. 2) Copy and paste the hook into a chosen slot. a. Make sure there's a space between ... and that, and a ? at the end. b. Check that there's a bold link to the article. 3) If it's the lead (first) hook, paste the image where indicated at the top of the template. 4) Copy and paste ALL the credit information (the {{DYKmake}} and {{DYKnom}} templates) at the bottom 5) Check your work in the prep's Preview mode. a. At the bottom under "Credits", to the right of each article should have the link "View nom subpage" ; if not, a subpage parameter will need to be added to the DYKmake. 6) Save the Prep page. Closing the DYK nomination page At the upper left Change {{DYKsubpage to {{subst:DYKsubpage Change |passed= to |passed=yes At the bottom Just above the line containing }}<!--Please do not write below this line or remove this line. Place comments above this line.--> insert a new, separate line containing one of the following: To [[T:DYK/P1|Prep 1]] To [[T:DYK/P2|Prep 2]] To [[T:DYK/P3|Prep 3]] To [[T:DYK/P4|Prep 4]] To [[T:DYK/P5|Prep 5]] To [[T:DYK/P6|Prep 6]] To [[T:DYK/P7|Prep 7]] Also paste the same thing into the edit summary. Check in Preview mode. Make sure everything is against a pale blue background (nothing outside) and there are no stray characters, like }}, at the top or bottom. Save. For more information, please see T:TDYK#How to promote an accepted hook. Handy copy sources: To [[T:DYK/P1|Prep 1]] To [[T:DYK/P2|Prep 2]] To [[T:DYK/P3|Prep 3]] To [[T:DYK/P4|Prep 4]] To [[T:DYK/P5|Prep 5]] To [[T:DYK/P6|Prep 6]] To [[T:DYK/P7|Prep 7]] How to remove a rejected hook[edit] Open the DYK nomination subpage of the hook you would like to remove. (It's best to wait several days after a reviewer has rejected the hook, just in case someone contests or the article undergoes a large change.) In the window where the DYK nomination subpage is open, replace the line {{DYKsubpage with {{subst:DYKsubpage, and replace |passed= with |passed=no. Then save the page. This has the effect of wrapping up the discussion on the DYK nomination subpage in a blue archive box and stating that the nomination was unsuccessful, as well as adding the nomination to a category for archival purposes. How to remove a hook from the prep areas or queue[edit] Edit the prep area or queue where the hook is and remove the hook and the credits associated with it. Go to the hook's nomination subpage (there should have been a link to it in the credits section). View the edit history for that page Go back to the last version before the edit where the hook was promoted, and revert to that version to make the nomination active again. Add a new icon on the nomination subpage to cancel the previous tick and leave a comment after it explaining that the hook was removed from the prep area or queue, and why, so that later reviewers are aware of this issue. Add a transclusion of the template back to this page so that reviewers can see it. It goes under the date that it was first created/expanded/listed as a GA. You may need to add back the day header for that date if it had been removed from this page. If you removed the hook from a queue, it is best to either replace it with another hook from one of the prep areas, or to leave a message at WT:DYK asking someone else to do so. How to move a nomination subpage to a new name[edit] Don't; it should not ever be necessary, and will break some links which will later need to be repaired. Even if you change the title of the article, you don't need to move the nomination page. Nominations[edit] Older nominations[edit] Articles created/expanded on September 2[edit] Articles created/expanded on September 27[edit] Roman campaigns in Germania (12 BC – AD 16) ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that the Romans won a series of campaigns against the Germanic tribes following the disaster at Teutoburg, but decided to leave Germany because its land was not considered valuable? Source: Wells (2003), The Battle That Stopped Rome, pp. 206–7 Improved to Good Article status by SpartaN (talk). Self-nominated at 03:34, 29 September 2021 (UTC). General eligibility: New Enough: Y Long Enough: Y Other problems: Y Policy compliance: Adequate sourcing: Y Neutral: Y Free of copyright violations, plagiarism, and close paraphrasing: Y Other problems: Y Hook eligibility: Cited: N - Source is offline but happy to AGF. However, in the article the statement “they considered German lands too poor for annexation” is sourced to p.204 of Wells. pp.206-7 referred to above is used to support that they that “it was too costly in economic and military resources” to go into in Germany. I guess either way the hook is sourced but could you clarify the exact sourcing of the hook. Interesting: Y QPQ: None required. Overall: Interesting thorough article, well-written with good quality sourcing. Earwig shows no issues. Just a minor query around the hook sourcing but otherwise will be good to go. DeCausa (talk) 08:23, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @DeCausa: I found the web link that (for me) shows a preview if you're able to see it: https://books.google.com/books?id=mc30CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA206&lpg=PA206 SpartaN (talk) 10:07, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @SpartaN: Thanks for providing the link. It’s prompted a couple of thoughts for me. Firstly, Wells doesn’t seem to be saying the reason for the withdrawal is definitively known (“… the reasons for these decisions must have lain…”) i.e he’s making an assumption, however well founded. The hook is more definite than Wells is. Secondly, Wells’ emphasis is on the strength of the resistance being behind the reason - the poor value of the territory makes it “not worth it” because of the strength of the resistance. That’s not quite the same as just saying the land wasn’t valuable. (I notice the text you used in the article on this reflects that effort/value ratio issue.) To fix both points would you be prepared to consider an ALT1 which after “…Teutoburg” continues something along the lines of “…likely decided to leave Germany because the military effort was out of proportion to the territory’s value?” although there may need to be some trimming to get it into the 200 character limit. DeCausa (talk) 11:12, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @SpartaN and DeCausa: It's been over a month since the last comments here, have there been any updates? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:31, 13 November 2021 (UTC) From my point of view I’m waiting for SpartaN’s reply to my last post here. But I notice they haven’t edited Wikipedia since then, over a month ago. So I’m not quite sure what can be done. DeCausa (talk) 08:17, 13 November 2021 (UTC) I see. Given that there's really only one issue holding the nomination back, would anyone be willing to adopt this in case SpartaN doesn't return? It would be a shame if the nomination failed at this point. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 06:35, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I’m not sure what exactly are the DYK rules on this but, subject to that, options could be (a) I propose an ALT1 hook and someone else signs it off; (b) someone else proposes an ALT1 hook and I sign it off; (c) if anyone disagrees with me on the original hook I’m happy to step away and they sign it off. DeCausa (talk) 11:04, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I've looked at the Wells source and concur that it is saying the withdrawal was more down to the ratio of effort required to potential reward, and have boldly tweaked the copy in the article to reflect this. For what it's worth, I think ALT1 works just fine. firefly ( t · c ) 11:16, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Ok. I’m just going to formalize the ALT1 and let someone else add the tick and sign off: ALT1:... that the Romans won a series of campaigns against the Germanic tribes after the disaster at Teutoburg but likely decided to leave Germany as the effort was out of proportion to the territory’s value? DeCausa (talk) 12:07, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Since the reviewer has proposed a new hook, another editor will be needed to sign this off. I'm not sure though if the section linking in the bold links is allowed, however. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:29, 15 November 2021 (UTC) sorry, I missed that. It’s not even necessary to link to a section of the article so I’ve taken it out of ALT1. DeCausa (talk) 08:21, 15 November 2021 (UTC) As this doesn’t seem to be moving I’m going to give ALT1 the tick as original reviewer. If the DYK regulars think this is out of process because I came up nwith ALT1 then happy for it to be reverted. DeCausa (talk) 22:46, 21 November 2021 (UTC) DeCausa, there is no rush to approve, and your approval of your own hook was indeed out of process. I have reverted SL93's promotion of the nomination to prep, and with any luck a new reviewer will be around soon enough to review your ALT1. (SL93, you're welcome to review it, but that means you cannot also promote it.) I've also struck the original hook due to the issues noted above. BlueMoonset (talk) 04:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) BlueMoonset Sorry for mixing up who approved it. SL93 (talk) 04:26, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I didn't notice the second sentence of the approval...not sure how that happened. Sorry, again. SL93 (talk) 04:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) DeCausa Reading through the article again, your ALT1 hook seems to be mostly verifed in the Aftermath section, but I'm not seeing any indication of it being "likely". SL93 (talk) 21:14, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, that’s true. Where that came from was, in the above discussion with SpartaN on the original hook, they cited Wells in support. Wells says, in relation to Tiberius’ decision to ‘give up’, that “The reason for these decisions must have lain in the Germans’ tough resistance”. I’ve taken that to mean Wells’ was inferring Tiberius’ reasoning without direct evidence (or certainty) of Tiberius’ actual reason. However, you’re right that the way the article is written is more certain. I’m ok striking the “likely” or, possibly it would be better to amend the final sentence of the first paragraph of the Aftermath section to be more reflectve of Wells. DeCausa (talk) 21:48, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I will leave this here for someone else to look at. It would be helpful if the nominator came back. SL93 (talk) 23:21, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Articles created/expanded on October 9[edit] Pankratius Pfeiffer ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that Salvatorian priest Pankratius Pfeiffer saved hundreds of Jews in Rome during the Second World War? Reviewed: 1936 Northeast Flood Created by Ergo Sum (talk). Self-nominated at 17:52, 9 October 2021 (UTC). New article that was created on 9 October 2021? is 3,212 characters and nominated on the same day. No copyvios detected and duplication detector of [1][2][3][4][5] reveal no close paraphrasing issues (AGF PDF docs which can't go through Dup detector). Article is well-sourced. Hook is 103 characters long (under 200 character max.) and is interesting. Refs 4 and 5 (verifying the hook) are reliable sources. QPQ done. Looks good to go! —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:41, 9 October 2021 (UTC) Too many red flags here. If he really saved hundreds of Jews, you would expect plenty of confirmation of this in scholarly sources and him to be recognized by Yad Vashem. I can't count the number of times that I've seen mainstream newspapers print completely false stories about Jews being rescued during the holocaust, so better sources are definitely needed to confirm these extraordinary claims. Thanks Brigade Piron for letting me know about this. (t · c) buidhe 16:51, 10 October 2021 (UTC) I have to admit I'm just a bit perplexed by the argument. Except in fairly uncommon cases of multiple RS that contradict each other, we don't generally recognize any "hierarchy" of reliable sources. Sources are either RS or they are not. So I'm not sure what kind of sources you have in mind as "better" sources. The ones currently cited in the article are all RS, so that should be the end of it. I might add that if you seek some manner of official imprimatur in the vein of Yad Vashem, the City of Rome named a street after him. Your point about why there isn't more extensive coverage of this historical figure is well taken but can easily be attributed to the fact that all manner of historical figures are lost to history, especially those who are notable really for one major event in their life that did not come to light until years later, as is the case here. Indeed, one of the RS in this article describes Pfeiffer as being "lost to history." I'm adding the new review icon here so that we can get at least one more editor's evaluation of this. Ergo Sum 13:32, 16 October 2021 (UTC) There are very few people who actually saved hundreds of Jews during the Holocaust and plenty of hoaxes that were reported as truth by various news organizations—for example Necdet Kent. In other cases, actual rescue did occur but the numbers are greatly exaggerated and repeated uncritically by news organizations, such as Raoul Wallenberg. If the story is true you would expect to see it covered in many more credible sources. There are plenty of cases where a source is reliable for some info but not others. For example, someone's CV is often reliable for "they worked at X organization" but not "they are a world expert in Z". Extraordinary claims require extraordinary sourcing. (t · c) buidhe 21:27, 16 October 2021 (UTC) I should say that I share Buidhe's concerns. I think saying that "all manner of historical figures are lost to history" rather side-steps the sheer volume of historical scholarship on all aspects of the Holocaust. On a more banal note, I think part of the problem is that the sources cited are, essentially, all journalistic sources published by explicitly Catholic or Salvatorian outlets. The specific sources cited for the "saved" claim are Romereports (I am not familiar with this outlet, but the typo in the video does not inspire confidence) and a self-published Salvatorian newsletter. Neither are scholarly sources and both are, again, explicitly confessional in nature. I think WP:BIASED may on point in a highly sensitive issue touching on the wider disputes about Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust. Do we know what the Samerski book says, for example? —Brigade Piron (talk) 08:55, 17 October 2021 (UTC) Buidhe It is true that the sources cover Catholic issues, but only the Salvatorian one is actually published by a Catholic institution. I need not go into how varied Catholic newspapers are in their adherence/faithfulness to the Catholic hierarchy and beliefs (see e.g. National Catholic Reporter versus National Catholic Register). But more direclty, there actually are many scholarly RS that discussion Pfeiffer and his works in Nazi-occupied Rome. You will find them on the other language versions of this article. The problem is that I do not read Italian or German well enough to use them in the article. Coverage is not the issue. It is English language coverage. Ergo Sum 13:48, 17 October 2021 (UTC) @Ergo Sum: perhaps add the word "reportedly" before "saved". I'm inclined to accept in good faith the sources used as reliable – none of them have not been deprecated nor deemed generally unreliable. —Bloom6132 (talk) 16:41, 26 October 2021 (UTC) DYK should not cover unconfirmed reports or rumors so I strongly disagree with that suggestion. As well as assuming sources are reliable if they've never been discussed at WP:RSN, which disregards important parts of WP:RS such as WP:CONTEXTMATTERS. There is no issue with citing sources in Italian or German, but if it's not confirmed that they support the content then it's incorrect to assume that they do. (t · c) buidhe 20:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Bloom6132: I tend to think that statements are either supported by RS and written in wikivoice or they're not accepted at all. For that reason, I shy away from words like "reportedly." I reiterate though that I think it's quite clear there's nothing wrong with the sources currently used. They're all RS, so that should be the end of it. Hence, why I think your initial review was satisfactory. Ergo Sum 23:40, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Ergo Sum: agreed. I'm still of the view that the hook satisfies criteria 3b. Criteria 4 states that "Nominations should be rejected if an inspection reveals that they are not based on reliable sources". That is not the case here. —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) You're still ignoring the principle in RS that context matters, and some sources are reliable for some but not other info. The two of us who actually write on Holocaust related topics have expressed that the sources cited are not reliable for the exceptional claims being made. (t · c) buidhe 23:59, 26 October 2021 (UTC) With all due respect, I am of the opinion that the sources used are reliable for the info in the hook. The fact that you and Brigade Piron write on Holocaust-related topics is irrelevant – it does not confer a veto over hooks pertaining to that subject. By that logic, I should be able to veto baseball or heraldry hooks ... —Bloom6132 (talk) 01:10, 27 October 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: Three of my DYKs promoted (including Coat of arms of the Falkland Islands from August this year) have included the word "reportedly" in the hook, as well as numerous hooks from other editors. Disagree all you want – this is accepted practice at DYK. —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: I'm aware that you have experience writing about Holocaust-related articles and I put value in your assessment as a solid editor. However, I'm quite comfortable in my ability to vet RS, as well, and my confidence in these sources means I must disagree with your opinion here. Experienced editors do disagree at times, and it is my opinion that I think you have gotten this one wrong; doubtless, you think the same for me. I haven't seen any evidence that these are not RS. Therefore, I recommend if Bloom6132 is inclined to do so, to renew their approval of the hook. In the meantime, I'm going to request the input of additional experienced editors on the DYK talk page. Ergo Sum 01:28, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm going to ping @Bamse, Bermicourt, Jmabel, and Anyfile to see if we can find some reliable sources in other languages. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 01:46, 27 October 2021 (UTC) Oops, @AnyFile theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 01:47, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm currently traveling & very busy, so not much help here, I'm afraid. - Jmabel | Talk 01:53, 27 October 2021 (UTC) That said, more or less this same case is made in The Pope's Jews: The Vatican's Secret Plan to Save Jews from the Nazis by Gordon Thomas (not currently cited in the article). - Jmabel | Talk 02:00, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm unclear as to why the cited sources are unreliable: are we assuming that all information emanating from a Roman Catholic source is unreliable? If so what's the logic? In any case there are dozens of book sources in English, German, French and Italian that mention Pfeiffer, the problem is that few are accessible online. One is an entire biography of Pfeiffer "from baker to Vatican diplomat" which would be useful to track down: Willer, Philomena (2005). P. Pankratius Pfeiffer SDS: (1872-1945); vom Bäckergesellen zum Vatikandiplomat. Pub: Josef Fink. Others that mentions Pfeiffer and the Jews in Rome are: Liebhart (1996) Schwangau. Meding (1992), Flucht vor Nürnberg. Sinn (1976), Illegal. Bermicourt (talk) 08:41, 27 October 2021 (UTC) My issue is with the unreliability of journalistic works and popular history, which have in many cases published inaccurate information about rescues of Jews during the Holocaust. If better sources exist, they should be cited instead. An additional question is, do these sources actually support the claim of "hundreds" of Jews rescued by Pfeiffer personally? (t · c) buidhe 08:51, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I've now found sources that cover most of the article. Here are more: Liebhart (1996) Schwangau. Meding (1992), Flucht vor Nürnberg. Sinn (1976), Illegal. Prince Constantine of Bavaria (1952) Der Papst. Layer (1985), Schwäbisches Ehrenbuch - Pfeiffer credited with "saving Rome and other Italian cities including Chieti, Ascoli and Ovieto from destruction and other calamities" _ (1999). Publik-Forum - Pfeiffer the only German to have a street named after him in Rome and who fought to save Roman Jews. _ (1960). Bayerische Frömmigkeit - Pfeiffer described as the "Saviour of Rome and other cities in Italy" Robert Katz has written a number of books - Death in Rome (1967), Black Sabbath (1969), The Battle for Rome (2010) - which all mention Pfeiffer. Bottum and Dalin (2004). The Pius War has this interesting piece: "7. Pancrazio [sic] Pfeiffer. According to Carroll-Abbing, one of the men used by Pius XII to protest the Nazi roundup of Rome's Jews and intervene for persecuted victims was Father Pancrazio Pfeiffer, superior general of the Salvatorian Fathers, who also served as Pius XII' personal liaison to the German military command in Rome. Because Pfeiffer died tragically in an automobile accident toward the end of the war and thus never took part in the postwar analysis of Pius XII's conduct, many historians have overlooked him. But those who knew him or have researched his life have chronicled his collaborative efforts with Pius XII to rescue Jews and others during the war. See the article "Pfeiffer's List" by Robert Graham, 30 Days, June 1994, pp. 42-46. Prince Constantine of Bavaria's book on Pius XII, The Pope (London: Allan Wingate, 1954) [listed above] contains an excellent section on Pfeiffer, whom he describes as an agent for the pope on behalf of the victims of persecution and the fugitives in hiding" (p. 213). At Pfeiffer's death in May 1945, Vatican Radio paid tribute: "He came into contact with the Commander of the German occupying forces [in Rome in 1943-44]. From that day onwards, he placed his religious and spiritual qualities at the service of many who had been arrested or already condemned to death. He helped countless people in this way, and saved their lives, among them many Jews and other Italian personages. He championed..." In short there seems to be book evidence for virtually everything stated in the article apart from the specific details of the two incidents where 249 or 400 Jews were rescued. Based on my initial searches my expectation is that those incidents are likely to be recorded in the literature - we just need to be able to access more of the sources. Meanwhile there is no harm in pausing to use some of the above sources, plus those I've added to the Further reading section of the article in order to reinforce the existing references and then review where we are.

For example, Salvatorians USA Province is not independent of the article subject and therefore is not reliable for self-serving assertions such as "he saved many Jews in Rome from persecution and ultimately death" or "Every day, Pfeiffer visited the Regina Coeli prison and another prison on Via Tasso, where he would often return with freed prisoners who had been sentenced to death." (t · c) buidhe 08:27, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: would you still object if the article instead relied on the sources found by Bermicourt? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 04:58, 5 November 2021 (UTC) Depends, the Samerski source looks reliable to me but the book published by "Österreichische Provinz der Salvatorianer" has the same issue of close connection to the article subject. (t · c) buidhe 06:27, 5 November 2021 (UTC) All right. @Ergo Sum: I'm not going to promote the nomination without consensus to move forward, so if you want to try and rework the article's sourcing to approval, that can work.

This slipped my mind completely this weekend. I will deal with this tonight. Ergo Sum 15:45, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I have added several inline citations to the article, which refer to sources that were (very helpfully) added by Bermicourt. These sources support several of the very specific claims in the article, as well as the general thrust of the article which is in dispute here, namely that Pfeiffer was a liaison and in that capacity saved many Jews and others from the Nazis. In light of these reliable sources supporting the general claims, I think any concern about the pre-existing ones describing some of his more specific actions is ameliorated. There is a trove of additional sources in the Further Reading section that additionally describe in much greater detail Pfeiffer's actions but they are either in a foreign language which I do not adequately read to make use of as citations or are offline. All being said, I think there is now ample sourcing to back up the article's claims. Ergo Sum 05:49, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks, Ergo Sum—@Buidhe:, if this sourcing is up to your standards, we can move ahead. If not, we're probably going back to WT:DYK and asking for more eyes. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 05:52, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Hi, I've flagged the specific content in the article that supports the hook as needing a better source. There are other active cleanup tags on the article as well. However, I think there's sufficient sourcing for a modified version of the hook without the words "hundreds of".

Bermicourt (talk) 08:33, 17 November 2021 (UTC) According to the source it's what Vatican Radio said about him after his death. DYK is not for eulogies imo. (t · c) buidhe 08:37, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I'm not following—is the source unreliable because it's after his death? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 08:40, 17 November 2021 (UTC) No, it's because it's Catholic presumably... We could always add "according to Vatican Radio..." But better still, we just need to cite the exact text from one of the many non-Catholic book sources and the problem will be solved. Bermicourt (talk) 08:46, 17 November 2021 (UTC) And yet another source: O'Reilly (2001) in Forgotten Battles: Italy's War of Liberation 1943-45 states that "the Vatican was able to assist many of Rome's Jews and others sought by the Germans through Father Pancrazio Pfeiffer's intervention with the Germans... His work was recounted by Robert Graham who has written extensively on the Vatican's role in World War II." Bermicourt (talk) 09:01, 17 November 2021 (UTC) And another: Bartley (2016) in Catholics Confronting Hitler states that "Father Pancrace [sic] Pfeiffer, a German priest and the superior general of the Salvatorian Order, was the pope's liaison with the German military. Several hundred hostages, including some under sentence of death, owed their release to the efficacious intervention of Father Pfeiffer." I don't know why I'm doing this - you can look up the references yourselves instead of opining and speculating from the sidelines in the classic Wikipedia way. :) Bermicourt (talk) 09:08, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @Bermicourt: Since it seems you have access to several sources that I do not (probably just requires further digging), would you want to add them as inline citations with page numbers, especially to support the proposition regarding hundreds of people saved?

I'd be in favor instead of the hook being split into two separate proposals: one hook about the fact that she was an internet celebrity who grew up in a place without tap water, and a separate hook about her going viral for making hamburgers. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:23, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Full review needed, which can also address the issue of the borderline ALT1 hook. BlueMoonset (talk) 04:23, 5 November 2021 (UTC) As far as I can tell the article meets DYK requirements, and a QPQ has been done. Earwigs finds a close match with Coda Media, but that's only because it was the source for quotes in the article, and all of them are properly referenced. I find the first hook hard to believe given China's international standing, and in any case as brought up by Bowlhover may be inaccurate anyway. As for the second hook, as I mentioned before it's ineligible as it's exactly 200 characters long, and per WP:DYK hooks that are at or shorter than 200 characters may be rejected per reviewer's discretion. Both ALT0 and ALT1 have struck: I am repeating my earlier suggestion that ALT1 instead be split into two separate hooks. As this is a China-related article and there appear to be some political discussion in the article, I'd also like to ask for a second opinion from someone more knowledgeable about China-related articles if the article doesn't fall afoul of relevant guidelines. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 13:12, 6 November 2021 (UTC) From Wikipedia:Did you know#The hook: The hook should be concise: no more than about 200 characters (including spaces and the question mark, but not including the ..., the space immediately following the ..., or any (pictured)). While 200 is a hard limit, hooks near or at this limit may still be rejected at the discretion of reviewers and administrators. This tool can be used for counting words. The guideline says that "200 is a hard limit", so it is not true that the 200-character ALT1 hook is "ineligible" or "simply too long". No reason has been given for rejecting a 200-character hook "at the discretion of reviewers". Here are two additional hooks based on the suggestion: ALT2: ... that Dianxi Xiaoge, who grew up in a remote Yunnan mountain without running water, is an Internet celebrity with roughly 16 million subscribers on all her platforms? ALT3: ... Dianxi Xiaoge went viral in China and internationally after making hamburgers for her grandparents who had never eaten them before? Cunard (talk) 07:48, 7 November 2021 (UTC) Well for one thing, the original was very difficult to read and seemed to combine too many facts into one hook. Usually DYK prefers simpler hooks whenever possible. In any case, I think ALT3 is the best hook here and the nomination is otherwise good to go, I'd just like to hear a second opinion from another editor on the article tone given that I'm a bit uncomfortable doing a solo review here given the "Commentary" section delves into some political matters. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:36, 7 November 2021 (UTC) On second thought, I have some concerns regarding the length of the article. Isn't it rather detailed for an internet celebrity's page? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 11:10, 7 November 2021 (UTC) That the article is "rather detailed for an internet celebrity's page" should not be a concern. The sources provided substantial analysis of her and her work, and this article reflects those sources. Other detailed articles for Internet celebrities include PewDiePie and MrBeast. Cunard (talk) 11:18, 7 November 2021 (UTC) Pinging Gatoclass for his input, as he responded to a discussion I raised about this nomination over at WT:DYK. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:57, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I don't think we need Gatoclass to restate themself. Here's what they said at WT:DYK: The article doesn't use the phrase "one of only three Chinese influencers to gain international influence", so I'm not sure where you got that, but it does say she is one of only three "Chinese Internet celebrities who have reached international prominence", and the problem with that claim is that it's sourced to an article that is two years old and therefore not up-to-date. With regard to the overall length, I would agree that it is overly detailed and could use a trim. I'm not sure this is relevant to DYK however, as "overly detailed" is not one of our criteria. What I would say is that the level of detail does raise the chances of close paraphrasing so the article would need to be carefully checked for that. Anybody else with an opinion on this article?

Thriley (talk) 20:57, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @Thriley: I'll ping BlueMoonset here in case I'm wrong, but I'm going to say no, it isn't. My reasoning here is that if the hook were read as plaintext, without any bolding or linking, it would be read as pretty much only interesting as it concerns the plot. The hook should concern Smit's life; if it concerns her work as an actress, only stating her role and not anything about production doesn't make the hook out-of-universe. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 21:28, 17 November 2021 (UTC) theleekycauldron, I was taking a look at the ALT1 hook and its sources, and the second Biography sentence is basically copied from Esquire—the Google translate version, at any rate. That's a problem. Another problem is that the source doesn't actually say that she was working as a hotel receptionist when she got the call, just that it was "one of these jobs", referring back to the four in the previous sentence, none of which were hotel receptionist. The article also needs a bit of copyediting. I don't think that either of the plot-based hooks should be used, and as Drmies notes, "first film" is not accurate, since it's Cross the Line that's in the source, which appears to be her fifth film. We could only use "first feature film" if the previous four in her filmography were all short films (which would need to be clearly sourced). Perhaps an angle for the information in ALT1 would be to say she was working in whatever job it was when she was cast in Cross the Line, for which she was nominated as best new actress in the Goya Awards. BlueMoonset (talk) 02:31, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Here’s an article that states she was working as a receptionist two years before she was hired to work on Parallel Mothers:[6] Does it appear reliable? Thriley (talk) 05:38, 20 November 2021 (UTC) I don't see a reason to doubt the source. However, it isn't sufficient to support the "when she was called" hook claim, just that she was a hotel receptionist two years before the article was written (and possibly two years and a number of months, since you can't assume it's exactly two years). BlueMoonset (talk) 17:14, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Perhaps the hook should include all her various jobs before her Almodovar role? Thriley (talk) 01:47, 23 November 2021 (UTC) ALT3 “before starring in the Pedro Almodóvar film Parallel Mothers, Milena Smit worked as a model, waitress, shop assistant, babysitter, teleoperator, subway information assistant, and hotel receptionist?” El País Thriley (talk) 01:51, 23 November 2021 (UTC) That hook is 197 characters which puts it in discretionary territory.

I do like the hooks and it's an intriguing subject for an article! I wanted to flag the following comments, in case they are helpful (please ignore if not!): I don't quite follow this sentence in the lead: "Moreover, it is still pointed out that the emendation Albruna agrees with the names of other Germanic wise women." Should "instriptions" (before the Drusus heading) be "inscriptions"? Should the names of scholars be wikilinked, where there is a page for the author (e.g. Simek)? What does mss mean, and could this be explained when it is first referenced? The second paragraph of the Aurinia section has two sentences starting with "However" in a row, which is a bit awkward to read.

To be expected, since they're cited almost 20 times each, and since the vast majority of the matches concern long quotes I'm willing to overlook it, but can we add more citations throughout the paragraphs? Particularly with "Conflict with Miles and Reynolds", there's four citations crammed at the end of the section. I think we should cite each after the corresponding sentences, especially where there's a direct quotation.

Its long enough and new and lots of good refs - including the hook fact. It documents a notable woman from the 14th century and there were not many of those.

Nice addition. well done Victuallers (talk) 10:31, 6 November 2021 (UTC) Reopening this because I think the hook is misleading, as according to the source it was usual for women of the nobility, like Neville, to sign with their own names.

We don't need to say it's unusual if we phrase it that way theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 02:14, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Theleekycauldron, the problem with both hooks is that they imply that there was something out-of-the-ordinary in a woman signing something in her own name in that era, whereas the source indicates that was normal practice for women of the nobility. So the hooks are misleading. Gatoclass (talk) 02:19, 19 November 2021 (UTC) All right—I'll ping @Lajmmoore and Victuallers: back here, y'all can work this out. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 02:33, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Was it usual for women in the fourteenth century to sign with their own name ... no. Is is usual for women in the 21st century to sign with just their first name? No. So "did you know that unusually Canada's head of state signs documents with just her first name and an R for Regina?" (Someone shouts) "BUT all British Queens do that!!" (Someone shouts) "That implies that it was unusual for Queens to sign with just their first name." No it doesnt. I think @Gatoclass: is reading the source and then saying that the hook doesnt explain every piece of information in the source... which obviously it doesnt. Its unusual that "a woman" is doing this at all. It WAS unusual for women in the fourteenth century to sign and if they did then they did not usually use just their own name. Its a fact - its unusual. Did You know that women did not sign their own names on documents in the 14th century? No I didnt. That is something that Lajmmoore wrote about and now I know. Thanks. Victuallers (talk) 08:28, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Hello Gatoclass all so the part of the source I was using is this, which is talking about signatures for charitable donation "Although most of the widows declare themselves to be the wife of their late husband, or their father's daughter, others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names, such as 'domina Margareta de Longvl' and 'don-ýina Margareta de Nevill' (the same person). The majority of widows declare that their marital status and their power to act, using a variety of phrases, including 'in pura viduitate', 'in pura viduitate mea et ligia potestate', and 'in viduitate mea propria et potestate legitima' ..." and I read that as it was more usual for (noble) women to use a signature that described them as "wife of, etc..." I read the passage as Legg using Margaret de Neville as an unusual example. Legg is talking about the Coucher Book signatures specifically, but I still think they are marking out unusual practice. In terms of the hook, I wonder whether changing 'woman' to 'literate woman' might work? Lajmmoore (talk) 09:32, 19 November 2021 (UTC) No, it wouldn't work just to add "literate". And your reading of the text just amounts to an unsupported assumption on your part. Because while the text could admittedly be less ambiguous, the statement that others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names does not in any way suggest that it was rare or unusual for a member of the nobility to give their name, it only states that members of the nobility as a class were inclined to give their names. So there isn't sufficient support in that statement for a hook which implies that Neville's act was in any way unusual for a member of her class. The hook makes Neville sound like some sort of proto-feminist who boldly challenged the system, when the underlying source only indicates that either her entire class did the same thing, or at least that it was an accepted practice for members of the nobility. So I still think that either the hook needs to be substantially reworked to more closely reflect the source, or a new hook be found. Gatoclass (talk) 02:53, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks for sharing your interpretation of your text Gatoclass. My interpretation (& so the hook) is based on Legg's use of the word most - in that "most of the widows declare themselves to be the wife of their late husband, or their father's daughter" and you rightly point out "others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names" but I think that needs to be balanced by the "most" earlier in the sentence i.e. for women generally, they don't give their name, but some noble women do but overall, for women signing their name, it is unusual enough to be pointed out in the text.

Whispyhistory (talk) 04:04, 13 November 2021 (UTC) @Whispyhistory: But that would be impossible, the article can't possibly mention IP addresses, it's about broken toes.

It's okay with me if allowed (dyk says hook needs to be in article and in the following ref). Whispyhistory (talk) 06:32, 13 November 2021 (UTC) I don't see that exact sequence of numbers in the source, although there are others that look a bit like an IP address. The trouble is, the nominator seems to be the source for it looking a bit like an IP address, which it does, but we can't use that unless the source makes a similar point, which it does not appear to do. Something like this might work (numbers might need to be changed as mentioned): ALT1 ... that a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone may be described as 88.5.3.2? Philafrenzy (talk) 10:16, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Regarding the image, it's a fun idea but I don't think we run images as quizzes and the image is simply a skeletal foot, and not closely enough related to the hook.

I don't see how the hook you're suggesting is hooky. What exactly is wrong with the hook proposed? It's in the article and it's supported by the sources cited. And the image is directly related to the hook. It engages the reader into a spotting game. Dr. Vogel (talk) 14:57, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Like everyone else, I rather like the IP-address hook. If we wikilinked IP address, it would be supported in the linked articles, and fulfill the requirement that anyone following the links will be able to verify the hook. I don't think we need sourcing that says that a specific sequence of numbers is an IP address, as we have sources giving the general format of an IP address, and creating an example would be a trivial calculation ("Are all four of these numbers separated by periods in the range 0-255?"): "IPv4 and IPv6 address formats". www.ibm.com. An IPv4 address has the following format: x . x . x . x where x is called an octet and must be a decimal value between 0 and 255. Octets are separated by periods. An IPv4 address must contain three periods and four octets. The following examples are valid IPv4 addresses: 1 . 2 . 3 . 4 01 . 102 . 103 . 104 This hook is better than any alternative I can think of, and I don't see anything likely to be problematic about it (it's certainly verifiable). I think we might be in agreement on that? So if some rule technically prohibits it, we might have a good case for applying the WP:Ignore all the rules policy. Broken finger is also currently DYK-eligible and I think it uses the same numbering scheme.[1] HLHJ (talk) 02:07, 14 November 2021 (UTC) [edit: add fulltext url] I don't necessarily agree with the reading of WP:DYKCRIT 3b ( Each fact in the hook must be supported in the article by at least one inline citation to a reliable source [...]) that says that the IP thing needs to be in the article (compare e.g. Template:Did you know nominations/Urine deflector, which similarly took some creative licence in how the proposed hooks were phrased beyond what was stated in either the article or the cited source), and I agree with HLHJ that WP:IAR would be applicable regardless. As for the hooks themselves, writing "a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone may be described as 88.5.3.2" is a much poorer way of writing the hook (less "hooky") than the converse, i.e. "88.5.3.2 may refer to a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone". TompaDompa (talk) 11:28, 14 November 2021 (UTC) This. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 17:01, 16 November 2021 (UTC) We can't use IP address because the nominator just thought it up "oh, that looks like an IP address". It's not in the source as the nominator admits and therefore is not verifiable. And so what if it does look like an IP address? What does that tell us about broken toes? I like clever or quirky hooks and have written many (if I may say so), but they have to be based on something in the sources otherwise it's things made up one day. Philafrenzy (talk) 10:19, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you for all your comments. This is not the place to ignore all rules. The proposed hook is not supported by the source given in the article. I am inclined to approve ALT1 but it needs checking, unless another hook is proposed. Whispyhistory (talk) 15:11, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Oh dear, this has become contentious. I think the contended question is whether it's acceptable to have verified information not found in the nominated article, but only in another article, linked in the hook. Not as hooky, but for illustration: ALT3 ... that the dot-decimal notation string "88.5.3.2" is not only an an IPv4 address, but also a fracture in the middle of the bone at the tip of the little toe? "IPv4 and IPv6 address formats". www.ibm.com., Hallux proximal phalanx fracture in adults: an overlooked diagnosis I don't think we're debating whether the IP-address-hook statement is verifiable. The statement that "88.5.3.2" (and any number in that format) is a valid IPv4 address is supported by the IP address article and the IPv4 article, and this format is the subject of the Dot-decimal notation article. No-one had bothered to cite those statements in those articles, but since they've been challenged here, I've now cited them. So "88.5.3.2 is both an IP address[1] and a code for a broken toebone[2]" is certainly verifiable, and is now verified on Wikipedia. Any DYK reader should have no trouble verifying that the hook is accurate. Alternatives that do not mention IP addressees are not as hooky, but don't contain more information about broken toes: ALT4 ... that "88.5.3.2" is a toe fracture in the middle of the bone at the tip of the little toe, while a "78.5.3.2" is the parallel broken finger?

Philafrenzy (talk) 19:25, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you Philafrenzy ( a very experienced DYK contributor) for your efforts in helping new editors understand DYK. Your comment higher up about "88.5.3.2" and "ip address" not being in the source is true and I am grateful for your suggested alts. Essentially, the initial and subsequent hooks sound good, but none are in the article or the source. I don't wish for personal comments and don't mind if someone else wishes to take over here. With due respect @DrVogel: and @HLHJ:...You may wish to take this up at Wikipedia talk:Did you know. Whispyhistory (talk) 10:41, 15 November 2021 (UTC) I won't say I wish I hadn't written the article; I hope it's useful enough to make up for the social harm to the project here. I don't think the hostility was intended by anyone; I suspect that it's felt partly due to the ease of mininterpretation in a text-only medium and partly due to human cognitive biases.[2] I certainly did, and do, not intend it. I spent a day's editing trying to resolve the conflict by finding references specifically saying that the two things were in notation X and adding that text to the article, but unfortunately non-inductive descriptions of the notations seem to have been considered so needless that an Internet RFC attempting to formalize them died of disinterest. I did find a source that explicitly defines the IPv4 format, and one that explicitly says that 88.1.2.2 is a specific fracture, and I've cited the latter in the article, but I don't think this helps. It is probably a bit unreasonable to expect a reviewer to do more than apply rules as best they can, and Wikipedia talk:Did you know might indeed be a better forum for a more detailed discussion. I don't really want to take part in one, though (nothing to do with this discussion, prior reasons). I posted because I felt responsible for the conflict and thought I might be able to help. My impression is that I made it worse; my apologies to everyone I've offended. HLHJ (talk) 03:41, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Nobody is offended, but if I may say so I think you are still missing the point. IP addresses have nothing to do with broken toes even if that notation may have a similarity. That's why the sources don't make the comparison and why the IP-based hooks are no good. Any of the other hooks might be fine (I haven't checked the numbers) just without the bit about IP addresses. The whole thing reminds me of unusually shaped vegetables where you may see a carrot shaped like a foot, people who see faces in clouds, and even apophenia. My personal observation that one thing looks a bit like another is not the basis for a hook unless reliable sources make the point too. Philafrenzy (talk) 09:09, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Folks, we are wasting a wonderful hook. Really. IP addresses have nothing to do with broken toes even if that notation may have a similarity and that is the whole point of making good hooks. They are supposed to be short, punchy, catchy, and likely to draw the readers in to wanting to read the article – as long as they don't misstate the article content. And one of the best recipes to make a hook good is to make it sound counterintuitive With any other option but the original, we are bound to receive another hook frequented by maybe a few hundred visitors. I would propose something to the tune of in some contexts, 88.5.3.2 might not mean an IP address but a broken bone in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone? so that no one claims here that we somehow delegitimise the IP address but at the same time so that we preserve the core of the hook. As for the claims that because the hook is not cited in the IP part, it can't be there - please don't be that pedantic. In our today's world of informatics we may assume that people who visit Wikipedia more or less imagine what IP addresses are, and may more or less imagine how they look like (in the worst case they will visit the article for details). The other part is cited. I see no problem with the original. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 17:01, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Szmenderowiecki I admit that I'm not very familiar with the topic, and the above discussion was confusing, but is the "this isn't an IP address" claim actually in the source? Because if it's not, then no matter how good the hook proposal is, it can't be used in a hook since hook facts need to be based on a reference. Also, I'm pretty sure that assumptions don't count as sources. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:31, 17 November 2021 (UTC) What I was leading is that we don't need to cite that the sky is blue, or that we have five fingers; or that there exist IP addresses for that matter.

We're allowed to. This is not a massive occasion where we can save the whole project by breaking the rules. Its a trivial example of what some (not all) think may be a breach in the rules, with a small, but amusing, advantage. So I'm not asking the defenders of the rules to admit that this is not a breech ... I am suggesting that they might just concede that the harm done by allowing this hook might not offend anyone ... and it might please a few thousand. Victuallers (talk) 15:28, 20 November 2021 (UTC) We don't need to break the rules. The observation that the notation looks a bit like an IP address is trivial and completely unrelated to broken toes. There are already perfectly good hooks above that work better. Nobody is saying don't use the numbers, just strike the bit about IP addresses. The originally proposed hook is not the work of comic genius and cleverness that some seem to think it is. Philafrenzy (talk) 21:58, 20 November 2021 (UTC) The main issue here is that it's one of the core rules of DYK that hook facts must be mentioned in the article, ideally explicitly or at least implied by supporting information. The thing is that at the moment, IP addresses are not mentioned anywhere in the article, so the hooks using the IP address angle would be ineligible according to that criterion anyway. Even April Fools hooks, which tend to be misleading, are still generally based on hook facts that are mentioned in the respective articles. So if we can't even grant IAR exemptions for that criterion for AFD hooks, the one day of the year where our hooks tend to follow the rules most loosely, I can't see why such a request should be granted here.

Nominated by Victuallers (talk) at 16:21, 6 November 2021 (UTC). Article is new enough. Two correct writers are credited. The article is fully referenced. No copyvio detected. There is a bit of biased POV pushing in Wikipedia voice: "most vulnerable to climate change". This will be something our subject is saying no doubt. And this idea is also reflected in the hook with "endangered". The hook content is referenced and confirmed by the Guardian, apart from the "endangered" bit, which opinion is attributed to Tina Stege. So I suggest that "endangered" is taken out of the hook, or it is reworded so it is clear she is saying that. Hook alt1 is unsuitable as it does not link the article and I cannot tell what it is trying to say in relation to the subject. I can confirm image is CC-BY-3.0 as derived from the video with CC-BY-3.0 license. However I would suggest that a different image is selected from the video, perhaps near the end where the microphone is not obscuring her chin. QPQ is done. Graeme Bartlett (talk) 06:03, 15 November 2021 (UTC) @Graeme Bartlett: Thanks for the review Graeme - I have recut a new image. Surprised that "endangered" wasn't referenced. I'm not sure it is just her opinion -"Projected sea level rise would mean 40% of the buildings in the Marshall Islands’ capital of Majuro would be permanently flooded and entire islands would disappear, potentially costing the Pacific country its status as a nation, according to a devastating new report from the World Bank." is a quote from the reference I have added to balance the idea that "endangered" might by pov.

Graeme Bartlett (talk) 20:56, 22 November 2021 (UTC) @Graeme Bartlett: Are you suggesting that we imply that "endangered" is her opinion despite the fact that she represents a nation and the "endangered" aspect is supported by the World Bank and the Guardian newspaper (and the 1bn people estimated to be part of the "High Ambition" group ) saying so? Is there any evidence that is just her opinion and not that of her country and the World Bank? Am I missing something? It you feel you need to give this "a cross" then can I suggest that we ask for a new reviewer?I have suggested an alt that does not use the endangered word.

Self-nominated at 23:51, 4 November 2021 (UTC). @DferDaisy: This article is about 3300 bytes, and was nominated for DYK shortly after creation, satisfying date and length criteria. There is a factual error, as the article states she was interred in Keokuk, Illinois, but the source says she died in Chicago, Illinois and was interred in Keokuk, Iowa. I am assuming good faith for a few references I cannot access (for example, ref 15 - The National Humane Review), which for me gives a landing page for the document, instead of an inside view). Otherwise, everything is properly sourced and there are no copyvio or close paraphrasing concerns (Earwig cites 3 potential problems, but they are not an issue here.) QPQ not required. Regarding the hooks, ALT0 is incorrect as stated, as it reads as if the study was conducted in the early 1900s by Meigs Crowder, whereas she published it in 1917 based on studies from that period. It'll need minor alteration. ALT1 is fine and sourced. I would prefer to promote an amended ALT0. A minor quibble, though not an issue for DYK: please add page numbers for cited sources. If online access is eliminated from the sources, it'll force anyone investigating those sources to wade through too many pages to find the desired detail.

AleatoryPonderings (???) (!!!) 01:52, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @AleatoryPonderings: Yes, but note that this court case is the "leading case with respect to the issue of common employers", establishing a precedent in Canadian law. At the time the lawsuit was filed, this was not the case, and in fact the trial judge ruled against Alouche (see last paragraph of background section); it was only after the case was brought to the Court of Appeal for Ontario that the "common employer doctrine" was established, and it became entrenched when leave to appeal the decision at the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed. Mindmatrix 15:11, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Ah, so the idea behind the hook is that, since Downtown Eatery changed the law on common employers, before Downtown Eatery Best Beaver would not have been Alouche's employer? That makes more sense. AleatoryPonderings (???) (!!!) 15:20, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: I'm going to inspect this again... Mindmatrix 15:18, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @AleatoryPonderings: Alright, so to ensure everything is correct, the following timeline occurred: Alouche was hired to be manager at For Your Eyes Only (owned by Grad and Grosman), and began work on 29 December 1992 Alouche was sent a Notice of Discipline in May 1993, and was fired on 15 June 1993 In October 1993, Alouche filed action for wrongful dismissal against Best Beaver Management Inc., as that was the source of his paycheques Best Beaver ceased operations in mid-1996, and all assets distributed to other companies owned by Grad and Grosman The trial resolved in favour of Alouche Best Beaver did not pay out the judgement (all its assets had been redistributed) Sherriffs were dispatched to For Your Eyes Only, where they seized $1,855 Downtown Eatery filed claim against Alouche, stating the cash belonged to it Alouche defended, and counterclaimed against Grad, Grosman, and all companies they controlled on the grounds of common employer doctrine, the oppression remedy of the Ontario Business Corporations Act, and fraudulent conveyance the judge in the second trial (at Ontario Superior Court of Justice) ruled against Alouche the case was brought to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, where the previous ruling was overturned in 2001 in January 2002, an application for leave to appeal the decision at the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed So, the common employer doctrine was part of the second trial as a counterclaim to the suit filed by Downtown Eatery. I just wanted to ensure this satisfies your concerns. Mindmatrix 18:25, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks for this incredibly thorough response. My concern is maybe philosophical or definitional. If I say that company A employs person B, that has an ordinary meaning and a legal meaning. It is probably right that Best Beaver did not employ Alouche in the ordinary sense of "employ", because Best Beaver was a "paymaster" and not the name on the front of the building where he went to work. My reading of the case itself is that, before Downtown Eatery, it was at best indeterminate as a legal matter whether Best Beaver, alone or in combination with its affiliate companies, employed Alouche. After Downtown Eatery, it was established—as a matter of legal meaning, but not necessarily ordinary meaning—that Best Beaver was his employer, or part of his employer, or something like that. The reason I brought this up is that it's not clear how one could verify the claim that "Best Beaver was not Alouche's employer", because that claim might be true as a matter of ordinary meaning but the only authoritative legal ruling we have on this (namely, Downtown Eatery) holds that the claim is false. In any event, I'll leave this to the eventual reviewer to sort out. I find my brain twisting into knots. AleatoryPonderings (???)

Interesting: N - see below Other problems: N - see below QPQ: None required. Overall: Hello, Mungo and welcome to DYK! Review as follows: The article is new enough, long enough and neutral. However, it includes a WP:IMDB source and I am unsure about the reliability of several other sources, including Film Ink, Queer Media Matters, Antaeus.org, Fern TV, Addicted to Horror Movies, Dan's Papers, Go Mag, Three Women in a Box and North Coast Rep. To add to that, the YouTube link does not appear to be uploaded by an official channel, making it unreliable. Additionally, per MOS:FILMCAST uncredited roles need a source. the copyvio checker showed up a 50%+ similarity with a source, which may suggest over quotation. On top of that, the subject has unclear notability. I'm unsure which roles are significant and The House on Pine Street appears to have a questionable notability. None of her awards seem significant and I'm not seeing any significant coverage from reliable, independent sources. ALT0 isn't very interesting given the festival is not significant enough to have an article. I think ALT1 is interesting but it seems to focus more on the character, not the actress which isn't exactly ideal... QPQ not needed. We'll need some work but we'll get there!

Thanks, DanCherek. while the article is over 1,500 prose characters, I'm going to be a stickler and say that this is still a stub.

Moving on, the article was created from a redir and nominated in time and is neutral, although I'm requesting a second opinion on the sourcing. The article seems to be plagiarism free, and a QPQ has been done. As for the hook, I'm not sure it quite checks out—is the church expected to break away? Because the article just says that a vote is planned and expected. Once we clear those two up, we're good to go. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 02:41, 21 November 2021 (UTC) @Theleekycauldron: Not entirely sure what the concern on the sourcing is; there are multiple reputable sources. Also, the lede is fairly clear that this is a planned schism, as the hook says. While I appreciate the review, I am dissatisfied with your effort.

Thanks! ~ Pbritti (talk) 05:10, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Isn't there a difference between "planned" (alt1) and "expected" (alt0)? planned implies it may or may not happen, expected is like forecasting—at least, that's how i read it. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 05:19, 21 November 2021 (UTC) @Theleekycauldron: Merriam-Webster considers them definitionally synonymous terms (see definition 2).

Maximilian Dood ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that in August 2021, YouTuber Maximilian Dood's viral social media campaign for Marvel vs. Capcom 2's rerelease caught the regards of studio Digital Eclipse, who expressed interest in rereleasing the game? Source: 1 and 2 Comment: This is the first time I’ve ever made a DYK here, so here goes. I personally find this fact interesting because it highlights how the advent of YouTube, and internet fame in general, has allowed people to use their voice to reach people in positions of high influence, bringing hidden ideas to light and advocating for change. While this specific example falls under a video game/pop-culture category, and may not fit Wikipedia’s desire for academic material, I feel that this is interesting enough to share, as it’s one the gaming community can relate to, like with other social media trends such as #FreeSmash and "Rerelease Mother 3." As for the article itself, all of the citations should be reliable enough; they’re all from third-party/secondary source outlets and there isn’t any BLP violation to be found here. One concern I have is criteria #3 - “Each fact in the hook must be supported in the article by at least one inline citation to a reliable source, appearing no later than the end of the sentence(s) offering that fact. Citations at the end of the paragraph are not sufficient.” While the hook is sourced in the article, the refs are at the end of the section rather than per each sentence. I can fix that however. Anyway, I hope this fact does get accepted! If not, I understand, thanks for reviewing this anyway. Created/expanded by PantheonRadiance (talk). Self-nominated at 08:45, 17 November 2021 (UTC).

Article is new enough, very newsworthy event and hence well-sourced, no copyvios (Earwig reports a false positive on the Johnson quotation), QPQ done.

Newness requirement satisfied by 5x expansion on 11/15 from < 600 to > 3000 characters. Articles also long enough and compliant with core policies on citations and neutrality. The hook is in-line sourced. Photo has appropriate license. QPQ is done. There are, however, two problems: (1) There is some significant overlap with this source. To start, the following sentence is taken from the source without use of quotation marks and with no effort to paraphrase rather than use the precise words: "Local advocacy led to the establishment of Bridle Trails as a state park in 1932." Further, this sentence also strikes me as too closely drawn from the same source: "Initial park development dates to 1933 when Civil Works Administration employees and federal relief workers were employed in state parks as part of the New Deal program. Further work included burning logging debris, clearing brush and building trails and fences." Work needs to be done to put the material into your own words. (2) The hook strikes me as boring in that it states an obvious point. Horses having the right of way on this trail is not unique or special. On trails that are shared by humans and horses, it is the general rule that horses have the right of way. See here ("In general, horses always have the right of way, followed by hikers, then by bikers."). See also here ("For safety reasons, if you come across a horse and rider on any trail they always have right of way. Hikers and bike riders all yield to horses.")

For one, the quote is not actually "could have been made by aliens" so, considering this is all about misquotation, we should either use the actual quote or clarify that it is a misquotation.

Graham87 09:41, 18 November 2021 (UTC) @Gerda Arendt: Thank you for the review. Diamonds were often cut in cabochon style in the 19th century and earlier. This one was cut with a flat bottom like all cabochons, and when viewed from above, it was a large oval, about 1.5 inches long. Modern cabochons usually have a smoothly rounded surface; this one was lightly faceted but the facets don't show on the sculpture. So it looks like half an egg, I suppose. The Koh-i-Noor is the large oval at the bottom of the picture. We have no specific citation for artistic licence - that is just a conclusion that we can probably make, since we have no evidence that Victoria ever had it set in a necklace. Therefore I cannot use "artistic licence" in a hook or in the article. I'll have a go at a hook using a full-length Victoria, and another hook using the Warrior and Wounded Youth sculpture. I'll come back shortly with those.

As for the hooks, I'm going to reject ALT0 out of hand, because Ben Comeau can take a number on that one. I'm also going to say no to ALT1, not because it's uncivil or uninteresting, but because it should be quoted—I've suggested two minor alts. A QPQ is also needed.

I've been trying to come up with something catchy on this -- for example, had Comeau invited Trump to participate in a performance of the work, then we could say he told Trump to fugue himself -- but the sourcing just isn't there that I can see. In consolation, here's an enlightening bit of musical history you will want to share with friends and family: Q: Why did Bach have so many children?

EEng 16:47, 17 November 2021 (UTC) The video for "Boris Johnson is a Lying Shit" includes a description from Comeau that basically screams for people not to vote for him, and the one for "Donald Trump is a Wanker" says "As satisfying as it is to poke fun at the Orange Monster, this video on its own probably won’t do the teeniest thing to reduce the devastation inflicted by the Trump administration. I therefore want to use this platform to suggest ways we can contribute to meaningful anti-Trump resistance.". We'd need to flesh out the article with these WP:BLPPRIMARY sources for the "thinks" to be properly verifiable.

Did you know that a recently discovered 1692 libretto of an actual Abendmusik bears similarities to Wacht! Euch zum Streit?[1][2]. Or that the Abendmusiken were actually presented right after Vespers?[3] Vespers, which themselves lasted two or three hours, in addition to a further three or four hour Hauptgottesdienst in the morning?[4][5] That might be one of the reasons why the audience was reported to be so disorderly, to the point that the town watch had to be hired to maintain a semblance of order.[6] That, and a lot more, which would surely allow to take this to DYK at a later time, after having greatly expanded this. Or at least, it's my opinion that taking the sole opportunity for DYK now would be a waste when it can be done when the article is expanded and made into something significantly more attractive and informative.

Fact is, I have the score and the whole text (including in translation) with me, in addition to lots of critical commentary on the piece itself (too much of which is focused on the question of authenticity, but alas...) and on the Abendmusiken in general. This can be used to make a proper article, but it would require time, which at the moment I really need to put into meeting an actual deadline than here. I've given you a list of pertinent sources (many of which are in German, if that's easier for you), if you're interested you know where to ask. On top of all of that, there's the question of article title (should it be at the current one or at Wacht! Euch zum Streit gefasset macht (a title which is used in a fair amount of sources, too...) Cheers, RandomCanadian (talk / contribs) 00:01, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Short version of what I replied on my talk: The time for it is in Advent. This year or next, that is the question. I'm also busy with other things, and both your familiarity with the topic, and your better English, make me wish you did it. For DYK, just raising attention is the goal. If you want it GA, we probably better wait. You decide. --Gerda Arendt (talk) 07:50, 22 November 2021 (UTC) The title: Wikipedia goes by the common title, and the other (and probably more) should be redirects.

Overall: Article meets eligibility criteria. i.e newness and article length. Article is well sourced and is neutral in tone. Hook is interesting and is cited. Copyvio scores ~20% in major part due to a quote that has been attributed rightly. However, the nominator might want to consider removing the quote and rewriting the sentence because the original Nepal Times article does not have it as a quote and is likely a paraphrasing done by the newspaper to begin with. Hence, we should not include it as a quote. In addition, I would encourage the nominator to consider expanding the article - to be clear, the article is good to go as-is. But looking at Hanuman Dhoka for instance there is an opportunity to build this article more than just a "History" section. Handing it back to the nominator. Some work and this is ready for homepage.

According to page 217 of "Account of the Late Granville Sharp...", Sharp approached Robert Kite, who is listed as lord mayor for only 1766. Can you reconcile those date discrepancies? (I do see that the Hochschild ref mentions the event as 2 years later from 1765, so there is some inconsistency in the reference material too.)

Further information: Official supplementary guidelines and unofficial guide  Warning: You are not logged in. Please create an account or log in to proceed. Alternatively, you may leave a message at the bottom of the DYK project talk page with the article you would like to nominate and the hook you would like to propose.  Warning: The helper script only works on desktop. Please switch to desktop view to continue. Install the DYK helper script by adding the line {{subst:lusc|User:SD0001/DYK-helper.js}} to your common.js page. Go back to the article, and choose the "DYK" option from the "More" menu (see image). Fill in the form and submit it. Check back periodically to address comments or concerns from the reviewer (it may take several weeks). Manual instructions[edit] Create a subpage for your new DYK suggestion and then list the page below under the date the article was created or the expansion began or it became a good article (not the date you submit it here), with the newest dates at the bottom. Any registered user may nominate a DYK suggestion (if you are not a registered user, please leave a message at the bottom of the DYK project talk page with the details of the article you would like to nominate and the hook you would like to propose); self-nominations are permitted and encouraged. Thanks for participating and please remember to check back for comments on your nomination (consider watchlisting your nomination page). Read these instructions completely before proceeding. For simplified instructions, see User:Rjanag/Quick DYK 2. I. Create the nomination subpage. Enter the article title in the box below and click the button. (To nominate multiple articles together, enter any or all of the article titles.) You will then be taken to a preloaded nomination page. II. Write the nomination. On the nomination page, fill in the relevant information. See Template:NewDYKnomination and {{NewDYKnomination/guide}} for further information. Not every line of the template needs to be filled in. For instance, if you are not nominating an image to appear with your hook, there is no need to fill in the image-related lines. Add an edit summary e.g. "Nominating YOUR ARTICLE TITLE for DYK" and click Publish page. Make sure the nomination page is on your watchlist, so you can follow the review discussion. III. Post at Template talk:Did you know. In the current nominations section find the subsection for the date on which the article was created or on which expansion began (or, if a new Good Article, the date on which it became a GA), not the date on which you make the nomination. At the top of that subsection (before other nominations already there, but below the section head and hidden comment) add {{Did you know nominations/YOUR ARTICLE TITLE}}. Add an edit summary e.g. "Nominating YOUR ARTICLE TITLE for DYK" and click Publish page. Frequently asked questions[edit] How do I write an interesting hook? Successful hooks tend to have several traits. Most importantly, they share a surprising or intriguing fact. They give readers enough context to understand the hook, but leave enough out to make them want to learn more. They are written for a general audience who has no prior knowledge of or interest in the topic area. Lastly, they are concise, and do not attempt to cover multiple facts or present information about the subject beyond what's needed to understand the hook. When will my nomination be reviewed? This page is often backlogged. As long as your submission is still on the page, it will stay there until an editor reviews it. Since editors are encouraged to review the oldest submissions first, it may take several weeks until your submission is reviewed. In the meantime, please consider reviewing another submission (not your own) to help reduce the backlog (see instructions below). Where is my hook? If you can't find the nomination you submitted to this nominations page, it may have been approved and is on the approved nominations page waiting to be promoted. It could also have been added to one of the prep areas, promoted from prep to a queue, or is on the main page. If the nominated hook is in none of those places, then the nomination has probably been rejected. Such a rejection usually only occurs if it was at least a couple of weeks old and had unresolved issues for which any discussion had gone stale. If you think your nomination was unfairly rejected, you can query this on the DYK discussion page, but as a general rule such nominations will only be restored in exceptional circumstances. Instructions for reviewers[edit] Main page: Wikipedia:Did you know/Reviewing guide Any editor who was not involved in writing/expanding or nominating an article may review it by checking to see that the article meets all the DYK criteria (long enough, new enough, no serious editorial or content issues) and the hook is cited. Editors may also alter the suggested hook to improve it, suggest new hooks, or even lend a hand and make edits to the article to which the hook applies so that the hook is supported and accurate. For a more detailed discussion of the DYK rules and review process see the supplementary guidelines and the WP:Did you know/Reviewing guide. To post a comment or review on a DYK nomination, follow the steps outlined below: Look through this page, Template talk:Did you know, to find a nomination you would like to comment on. Click the "Review or comment" link at the top of the nomination. You will be taken to the nomination subpage. The top of the page includes a list of the DYK criteria. Check the article to ensure it meets all the relevant criteria. To indicate the result of the review (i.e., whether the nomination passes, fails, or needs some minor changes), leave a signed comment on the page. Please begin with one of the 5 review symbols that appear at the top of the edit screen, and then indicate all aspects of the article that you have reviewed; your comment should look something like the following: Article length and age are fine, no copyvio or plagiarism concerns, reliable sources are used. But the hook needs to be shortened. If you are the first person to comment on the nomination, there will be a line :* <!-- REPLACE THIS LINE TO WRITE FIRST COMMENT, KEEPING  :* --> showing you where you should put the comment. Save the page. If there is any problem or concern about a nomination, please consider notifying the nominator by placing {{subst:DYKproblem|Article|header=yes|sig=yes}} on the nominator's talk page. Instructions for project members[edit] How to promote an accepted hook[edit] At-a-glance instructions on how to promote an approved hook to a Prep area See Wikipedia:Did you know/Preparation areas for details on verifying a hook's acceptability. Promoters should not promote their own nomination or their own review When promoting hooks intended for a particular date, keep in mind that when the number of available approved nominations exceeds 120 we switch to two sets per day, and when that number drops below 60 we return to one set per day. Check list for nomination review completeness 1) Select a hook from the approved nominations page that has one of these ticks at the bottom post: . 2) Check to make sure basic review requirements were completed. a. Any outstanding issue following needs to be addressed before promoting. 3) Check the article history for any substantive changes since it was nominated or reviewed. 4) Images for the lead slot must be freely licensed. Fair-use images are not permitted. Images loaded on Commons that appear on the Main Page are automatically protected by KrinkleBot. 5) Hook must be stated in both the article and source (which must be cited at the end of the article sentence where stated). 6) Hook should make sense grammatically. 7) Try to vary subject matters within each prep area. 8) Try to select a funny, quirky or otherwise upbeat hook for the last or bottom hook in the set. Steps to add a hook to prep In one tab, open the nomination page of the hook you want to promote. In a second tab, open the prep set you intend to add the hook to. 1) For hooks held for specific dates, refer to "Local update times" section on DYK Queue. a. Completed Prep area number sets will be promoted by an administrator to corresponding Queue number. 2) Copy and paste the hook into a chosen slot. a. Make sure there's a space between ... and that, and a ? at the end. b. Check that there's a bold link to the article. 3) If it's the lead (first) hook, paste the image where indicated at the top of the template. 4) Copy and paste ALL the credit information (the {{DYKmake}} and {{DYKnom}} templates) at the bottom 5) Check your work in the prep's Preview mode. a. At the bottom under "Credits", to the right of each article should have the link "View nom subpage" ; if not, a subpage parameter will need to be added to the DYKmake. 6) Save the Prep page. Closing the DYK nomination page At the upper left Change {{DYKsubpage to {{subst:DYKsubpage Change |passed= to |passed=yes At the bottom Just above the line containing }}<!--Please do not write below this line or remove this line. Place comments above this line.--> insert a new, separate line containing one of the following: To [[T:DYK/P1|Prep 1]] To [[T:DYK/P2|Prep 2]] To [[T:DYK/P3|Prep 3]] To [[T:DYK/P4|Prep 4]] To [[T:DYK/P5|Prep 5]] To [[T:DYK/P6|Prep 6]] To [[T:DYK/P7|Prep 7]] Also paste the same thing into the edit summary. Check in Preview mode. Make sure everything is against a pale blue background (nothing outside) and there are no stray characters, like }}, at the top or bottom. Save. For more information, please see T:TDYK#How to promote an accepted hook. Handy copy sources: To [[T:DYK/P1|Prep 1]] To [[T:DYK/P2|Prep 2]] To [[T:DYK/P3|Prep 3]] To [[T:DYK/P4|Prep 4]] To [[T:DYK/P5|Prep 5]] To [[T:DYK/P6|Prep 6]] To [[T:DYK/P7|Prep 7]] How to remove a rejected hook[edit] Open the DYK nomination subpage of the hook you would like to remove. (It's best to wait several days after a reviewer has rejected the hook, just in case someone contests or the article undergoes a large change.) In the window where the DYK nomination subpage is open, replace the line {{DYKsubpage with {{subst:DYKsubpage, and replace |passed= with |passed=no. Then save the page. This has the effect of wrapping up the discussion on the DYK nomination subpage in a blue archive box and stating that the nomination was unsuccessful, as well as adding the nomination to a category for archival purposes. How to remove a hook from the prep areas or queue[edit] Edit the prep area or queue where the hook is and remove the hook and the credits associated with it. Go to the hook's nomination subpage (there should have been a link to it in the credits section). View the edit history for that page Go back to the last version before the edit where the hook was promoted, and revert to that version to make the nomination active again. Add a new icon on the nomination subpage to cancel the previous tick and leave a comment after it explaining that the hook was removed from the prep area or queue, and why, so that later reviewers are aware of this issue. Add a transclusion of the template back to this page so that reviewers can see it. It goes under the date that it was first created/expanded/listed as a GA. You may need to add back the day header for that date if it had been removed from this page. If you removed the hook from a queue, it is best to either replace it with another hook from one of the prep areas, or to leave a message at WT:DYK asking someone else to do so. How to move a nomination subpage to a new name[edit] Don't; it should not ever be necessary, and will break some links which will later need to be repaired. Even if you change the title of the article, you don't need to move the nomination page. Nominations[edit] Older nominations[edit] Articles created/expanded on September 2[edit] Articles created/expanded on September 27[edit] Roman campaigns in Germania (12 BC – AD 16) ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that the Romans won a series of campaigns against the Germanic tribes following the disaster at Teutoburg, but decided to leave Germany because its land was not considered valuable? Source: Wells (2003), The Battle That Stopped Rome, pp. 206–7 Improved to Good Article status by SpartaN (talk). Self-nominated at 03:34, 29 September 2021 (UTC). General eligibility: New Enough: Y Long Enough: Y Other problems: Y Policy compliance: Adequate sourcing: Y Neutral: Y Free of copyright violations, plagiarism, and close paraphrasing: Y Other problems: Y Hook eligibility: Cited: N - Source is offline but happy to AGF. However, in the article the statement “they considered German lands too poor for annexation” is sourced to p.204 of Wells. pp.206-7 referred to above is used to support that they that “it was too costly in economic and military resources” to go into in Germany. I guess either way the hook is sourced but could you clarify the exact sourcing of the hook. Interesting: Y QPQ: None required. Overall: Interesting thorough article, well-written with good quality sourcing. Earwig shows no issues. Just a minor query around the hook sourcing but otherwise will be good to go. DeCausa (talk) 08:23, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @DeCausa: I found the web link that (for me) shows a preview if you're able to see it: https://books.google.com/books?id=mc30CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA206&lpg=PA206 SpartaN (talk) 10:07, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @SpartaN: Thanks for providing the link. It’s prompted a couple of thoughts for me. Firstly, Wells doesn’t seem to be saying the reason for the withdrawal is definitively known (“… the reasons for these decisions must have lain…”) i.e he’s making an assumption, however well founded. The hook is more definite than Wells is. Secondly, Wells’ emphasis is on the strength of the resistance being behind the reason - the poor value of the territory makes it “not worth it” because of the strength of the resistance. That’s not quite the same as just saying the land wasn’t valuable. (I notice the text you used in the article on this reflects that effort/value ratio issue.) To fix both points would you be prepared to consider an ALT1 which after “…Teutoburg” continues something along the lines of “…likely decided to leave Germany because the military effort was out of proportion to the territory’s value?” although there may need to be some trimming to get it into the 200 character limit. DeCausa (talk) 11:12, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @SpartaN and DeCausa: It's been over a month since the last comments here, have there been any updates? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:31, 13 November 2021 (UTC) From my point of view I’m waiting for SpartaN’s reply to my last post here. But I notice they haven’t edited Wikipedia since then, over a month ago. So I’m not quite sure what can be done. DeCausa (talk) 08:17, 13 November 2021 (UTC) I see. Given that there's really only one issue holding the nomination back, would anyone be willing to adopt this in case SpartaN doesn't return? It would be a shame if the nomination failed at this point. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 06:35, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I’m not sure what exactly are the DYK rules on this but, subject to that, options could be (a) I propose an ALT1 hook and someone else signs it off; (b) someone else proposes an ALT1 hook and I sign it off; (c) if anyone disagrees with me on the original hook I’m happy to step away and they sign it off. DeCausa (talk) 11:04, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I've looked at the Wells source and concur that it is saying the withdrawal was more down to the ratio of effort required to potential reward, and have boldly tweaked the copy in the article to reflect this. For what it's worth, I think ALT1 works just fine. firefly ( t · c ) 11:16, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Ok. I’m just going to formalize the ALT1 and let someone else add the tick and sign off: ALT1:... that the Romans won a series of campaigns against the Germanic tribes after the disaster at Teutoburg but likely decided to leave Germany as the effort was out of proportion to the territory’s value? DeCausa (talk) 12:07, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Since the reviewer has proposed a new hook, another editor will be needed to sign this off. I'm not sure though if the section linking in the bold links is allowed, however. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:29, 15 November 2021 (UTC) sorry, I missed that. It’s not even necessary to link to a section of the article so I’ve taken it out of ALT1. DeCausa (talk) 08:21, 15 November 2021 (UTC) As this doesn’t seem to be moving I’m going to give ALT1 the tick as original reviewer. If the DYK regulars think this is out of process because I came up nwith ALT1 then happy for it to be reverted. DeCausa (talk) 22:46, 21 November 2021 (UTC) DeCausa, there is no rush to approve, and your approval of your own hook was indeed out of process. I have reverted SL93's promotion of the nomination to prep, and with any luck a new reviewer will be around soon enough to review your ALT1. (SL93, you're welcome to review it, but that means you cannot also promote it.) I've also struck the original hook due to the issues noted above. BlueMoonset (talk) 04:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) BlueMoonset Sorry for mixing up who approved it. SL93 (talk) 04:26, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I didn't notice the second sentence of the approval...not sure how that happened. Sorry, again. SL93 (talk) 04:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) DeCausa Reading through the article again, your ALT1 hook seems to be mostly verifed in the Aftermath section, but I'm not seeing any indication of it being "likely". SL93 (talk) 21:14, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, that’s true. Where that came from was, in the above discussion with SpartaN on the original hook, they cited Wells in support. Wells says, in relation to Tiberius’ decision to ‘give up’, that “The reason for these decisions must have lain in the Germans’ tough resistance”. I’ve taken that to mean Wells’ was inferring Tiberius’ reasoning without direct evidence (or certainty) of Tiberius’ actual reason. However, you’re right that the way the article is written is more certain. I’m ok striking the “likely” or, possibly it would be better to amend the final sentence of the first paragraph of the Aftermath section to be more reflectve of Wells. DeCausa (talk) 21:48, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I will leave this here for someone else to look at. It would be helpful if the nominator came back. SL93 (talk) 23:21, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Articles created/expanded on October 9[edit] Pankratius Pfeiffer ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that Salvatorian priest Pankratius Pfeiffer saved hundreds of Jews in Rome during the Second World War? Reviewed: 1936 Northeast Flood Created by Ergo Sum (talk). Self-nominated at 17:52, 9 October 2021 (UTC). New article that was created on 9 October 2021? is 3,212 characters and nominated on the same day. No copyvios detected and duplication detector of [1][2][3][4][5] reveal no close paraphrasing issues (AGF PDF docs which can't go through Dup detector). Article is well-sourced. Hook is 103 characters long (under 200 character max.) and is interesting. Refs 4 and 5 (verifying the hook) are reliable sources. QPQ done. Looks good to go! —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:41, 9 October 2021 (UTC) Too many red flags here. If he really saved hundreds of Jews, you would expect plenty of confirmation of this in scholarly sources and him to be recognized by Yad Vashem. I can't count the number of times that I've seen mainstream newspapers print completely false stories about Jews being rescued during the holocaust, so better sources are definitely needed to confirm these extraordinary claims. Thanks Brigade Piron for letting me know about this. (t · c) buidhe 16:51, 10 October 2021 (UTC) I have to admit I'm just a bit perplexed by the argument. Except in fairly uncommon cases of multiple RS that contradict each other, we don't generally recognize any "hierarchy" of reliable sources. Sources are either RS or they are not. So I'm not sure what kind of sources you have in mind as "better" sources. The ones currently cited in the article are all RS, so that should be the end of it. I might add that if you seek some manner of official imprimatur in the vein of Yad Vashem, the City of Rome named a street after him. Your point about why there isn't more extensive coverage of this historical figure is well taken but can easily be attributed to the fact that all manner of historical figures are lost to history, especially those who are notable really for one major event in their life that did not come to light until years later, as is the case here. Indeed, one of the RS in this article describes Pfeiffer as being "lost to history." I'm adding the new review icon here so that we can get at least one more editor's evaluation of this. Ergo Sum 13:32, 16 October 2021 (UTC) There are very few people who actually saved hundreds of Jews during the Holocaust and plenty of hoaxes that were reported as truth by various news organizations—for example Necdet Kent. In other cases, actual rescue did occur but the numbers are greatly exaggerated and repeated uncritically by news organizations, such as Raoul Wallenberg. If the story is true you would expect to see it covered in many more credible sources. There are plenty of cases where a source is reliable for some info but not others. For example, someone's CV is often reliable for "they worked at X organization" but not "they are a world expert in Z". Extraordinary claims require extraordinary sourcing. (t · c) buidhe 21:27, 16 October 2021 (UTC) I should say that I share Buidhe's concerns. I think saying that "all manner of historical figures are lost to history" rather side-steps the sheer volume of historical scholarship on all aspects of the Holocaust. On a more banal note, I think part of the problem is that the sources cited are, essentially, all journalistic sources published by explicitly Catholic or Salvatorian outlets. The specific sources cited for the "saved" claim are Romereports (I am not familiar with this outlet, but the typo in the video does not inspire confidence) and a self-published Salvatorian newsletter. Neither are scholarly sources and both are, again, explicitly confessional in nature. I think WP:BIASED may on point in a highly sensitive issue touching on the wider disputes about Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust. Do we know what the Samerski book says, for example? —Brigade Piron (talk) 08:55, 17 October 2021 (UTC) Buidhe It is true that the sources cover Catholic issues, but only the Salvatorian one is actually published by a Catholic institution. I need not go into how varied Catholic newspapers are in their adherence/faithfulness to the Catholic hierarchy and beliefs (see e.g. National Catholic Reporter versus National Catholic Register). But more direclty, there actually are many scholarly RS that discussion Pfeiffer and his works in Nazi-occupied Rome. You will find them on the other language versions of this article. The problem is that I do not read Italian or German well enough to use them in the article. Coverage is not the issue. It is English language coverage. Ergo Sum 13:48, 17 October 2021 (UTC) @Ergo Sum: perhaps add the word "reportedly" before "saved". I'm inclined to accept in good faith the sources used as reliable – none of them have not been deprecated nor deemed generally unreliable. —Bloom6132 (talk) 16:41, 26 October 2021 (UTC) DYK should not cover unconfirmed reports or rumors so I strongly disagree with that suggestion. As well as assuming sources are reliable if they've never been discussed at WP:RSN, which disregards important parts of WP:RS such as WP:CONTEXTMATTERS. There is no issue with citing sources in Italian or German, but if it's not confirmed that they support the content then it's incorrect to assume that they do. (t · c) buidhe 20:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Bloom6132: I tend to think that statements are either supported by RS and written in wikivoice or they're not accepted at all. For that reason, I shy away from words like "reportedly." I reiterate though that I think it's quite clear there's nothing wrong with the sources currently used. They're all RS, so that should be the end of it. Hence, why I think your initial review was satisfactory. Ergo Sum 23:40, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Ergo Sum: agreed. I'm still of the view that the hook satisfies criteria 3b. Criteria 4 states that "Nominations should be rejected if an inspection reveals that they are not based on reliable sources". That is not the case here. —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) You're still ignoring the principle in RS that context matters, and some sources are reliable for some but not other info. The two of us who actually write on Holocaust related topics have expressed that the sources cited are not reliable for the exceptional claims being made. (t · c) buidhe 23:59, 26 October 2021 (UTC) With all due respect, I am of the opinion that the sources used are reliable for the info in the hook. The fact that you and Brigade Piron write on Holocaust-related topics is irrelevant – it does not confer a veto over hooks pertaining to that subject. By that logic, I should be able to veto baseball or heraldry hooks ... —Bloom6132 (talk) 01:10, 27 October 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: Three of my DYKs promoted (including Coat of arms of the Falkland Islands from August this year) have included the word "reportedly" in the hook, as well as numerous hooks from other editors. Disagree all you want – this is accepted practice at DYK. —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: I'm aware that you have experience writing about Holocaust-related articles and I put value in your assessment as a solid editor. However, I'm quite comfortable in my ability to vet RS, as well, and my confidence in these sources means I must disagree with your opinion here. Experienced editors do disagree at times, and it is my opinion that I think you have gotten this one wrong; doubtless, you think the same for me. I haven't seen any evidence that these are not RS. Therefore, I recommend if Bloom6132 is inclined to do so, to renew their approval of the hook. In the meantime, I'm going to request the input of additional experienced editors on the DYK talk page. Ergo Sum 01:28, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm going to ping @Bamse, Bermicourt, Jmabel, and Anyfile to see if we can find some reliable sources in other languages. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 01:46, 27 October 2021 (UTC) Oops, @AnyFile theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 01:47, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm currently traveling & very busy, so not much help here, I'm afraid. - Jmabel | Talk 01:53, 27 October 2021 (UTC) That said, more or less this same case is made in The Pope's Jews: The Vatican's Secret Plan to Save Jews from the Nazis by Gordon Thomas (not currently cited in the article). - Jmabel | Talk 02:00, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm unclear as to why the cited sources are unreliable: are we assuming that all information emanating from a Roman Catholic source is unreliable? If so what's the logic? In any case there are dozens of book sources in English, German, French and Italian that mention Pfeiffer, the problem is that few are accessible online. One is an entire biography of Pfeiffer "from baker to Vatican diplomat" which would be useful to track down: Willer, Philomena (2005). P. Pankratius Pfeiffer SDS: (1872-1945); vom Bäckergesellen zum Vatikandiplomat. Pub: Josef Fink. Others that mentions Pfeiffer and the Jews in Rome are: Liebhart (1996) Schwangau. Meding (1992), Flucht vor Nürnberg. Sinn (1976), Illegal. Bermicourt (talk) 08:41, 27 October 2021 (UTC) My issue is with the unreliability of journalistic works and popular history, which have in many cases published inaccurate information about rescues of Jews during the Holocaust. If better sources exist, they should be cited instead. An additional question is, do these sources actually support the claim of "hundreds" of Jews rescued by Pfeiffer personally? (t · c) buidhe 08:51, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I've now found sources that cover most of the article. Here are more: Liebhart (1996) Schwangau. Meding (1992), Flucht vor Nürnberg. Sinn (1976), Illegal. Prince Constantine of Bavaria (1952) Der Papst. Layer (1985), Schwäbisches Ehrenbuch - Pfeiffer credited with "saving Rome and other Italian cities including Chieti, Ascoli and Ovieto from destruction and other calamities" _ (1999). Publik-Forum - Pfeiffer the only German to have a street named after him in Rome and who fought to save Roman Jews. _ (1960). Bayerische Frömmigkeit - Pfeiffer described as the "Saviour of Rome and other cities in Italy" Robert Katz has written a number of books - Death in Rome (1967), Black Sabbath (1969), The Battle for Rome (2010) - which all mention Pfeiffer. Bottum and Dalin (2004). The Pius War has this interesting piece: "7. Pancrazio [sic] Pfeiffer. According to Carroll-Abbing, one of the men used by Pius XII to protest the Nazi roundup of Rome's Jews and intervene for persecuted victims was Father Pancrazio Pfeiffer, superior general of the Salvatorian Fathers, who also served as Pius XII' personal liaison to the German military command in Rome. Because Pfeiffer died tragically in an automobile accident toward the end of the war and thus never took part in the postwar analysis of Pius XII's conduct, many historians have overlooked him. But those who knew him or have researched his life have chronicled his collaborative efforts with Pius XII to rescue Jews and others during the war. See the article "Pfeiffer's List" by Robert Graham, 30 Days, June 1994, pp. 42-46. Prince Constantine of Bavaria's book on Pius XII, The Pope (London: Allan Wingate, 1954) [listed above] contains an excellent section on Pfeiffer, whom he describes as an agent for the pope on behalf of the victims of persecution and the fugitives in hiding" (p. 213). At Pfeiffer's death in May 1945, Vatican Radio paid tribute: "He came into contact with the Commander of the German occupying forces [in Rome in 1943-44]. From that day onwards, he placed his religious and spiritual qualities at the service of many who had been arrested or already condemned to death. He helped countless people in this way, and saved their lives, among them many Jews and other Italian personages. He championed..." In short there seems to be book evidence for virtually everything stated in the article apart from the specific details of the two incidents where 249 or 400 Jews were rescued. Based on my initial searches my expectation is that those incidents are likely to be recorded in the literature - we just need to be able to access more of the sources. Meanwhile there is no harm in pausing to use some of the above sources, plus those I've added to the Further reading section of the article in order to reinforce the existing references and then review where we are.

For example, Salvatorians USA Province is not independent of the article subject and therefore is not reliable for self-serving assertions such as "he saved many Jews in Rome from persecution and ultimately death" or "Every day, Pfeiffer visited the Regina Coeli prison and another prison on Via Tasso, where he would often return with freed prisoners who had been sentenced to death." (t · c) buidhe 08:27, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: would you still object if the article instead relied on the sources found by Bermicourt? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 04:58, 5 November 2021 (UTC) Depends, the Samerski source looks reliable to me but the book published by "Österreichische Provinz der Salvatorianer" has the same issue of close connection to the article subject. (t · c) buidhe 06:27, 5 November 2021 (UTC) All right. @Ergo Sum: I'm not going to promote the nomination without consensus to move forward, so if you want to try and rework the article's sourcing to approval, that can work.

This slipped my mind completely this weekend. I will deal with this tonight. Ergo Sum 15:45, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I have added several inline citations to the article, which refer to sources that were (very helpfully) added by Bermicourt. These sources support several of the very specific claims in the article, as well as the general thrust of the article which is in dispute here, namely that Pfeiffer was a liaison and in that capacity saved many Jews and others from the Nazis. In light of these reliable sources supporting the general claims, I think any concern about the pre-existing ones describing some of his more specific actions is ameliorated. There is a trove of additional sources in the Further Reading section that additionally describe in much greater detail Pfeiffer's actions but they are either in a foreign language which I do not adequately read to make use of as citations or are offline. All being said, I think there is now ample sourcing to back up the article's claims. Ergo Sum 05:49, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks, Ergo Sum—@Buidhe:, if this sourcing is up to your standards, we can move ahead. If not, we're probably going back to WT:DYK and asking for more eyes. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 05:52, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Hi, I've flagged the specific content in the article that supports the hook as needing a better source. There are other active cleanup tags on the article as well. However, I think there's sufficient sourcing for a modified version of the hook without the words "hundreds of".

Bermicourt (talk) 08:33, 17 November 2021 (UTC) According to the source it's what Vatican Radio said about him after his death. DYK is not for eulogies imo. (t · c) buidhe 08:37, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I'm not following—is the source unreliable because it's after his death? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 08:40, 17 November 2021 (UTC) No, it's because it's Catholic presumably... We could always add "according to Vatican Radio..." But better still, we just need to cite the exact text from one of the many non-Catholic book sources and the problem will be solved. Bermicourt (talk) 08:46, 17 November 2021 (UTC) And yet another source: O'Reilly (2001) in Forgotten Battles: Italy's War of Liberation 1943-45 states that "the Vatican was able to assist many of Rome's Jews and others sought by the Germans through Father Pancrazio Pfeiffer's intervention with the Germans... His work was recounted by Robert Graham who has written extensively on the Vatican's role in World War II." Bermicourt (talk) 09:01, 17 November 2021 (UTC) And another: Bartley (2016) in Catholics Confronting Hitler states that "Father Pancrace [sic] Pfeiffer, a German priest and the superior general of the Salvatorian Order, was the pope's liaison with the German military. Several hundred hostages, including some under sentence of death, owed their release to the efficacious intervention of Father Pfeiffer." I don't know why I'm doing this - you can look up the references yourselves instead of opining and speculating from the sidelines in the classic Wikipedia way. :) Bermicourt (talk) 09:08, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @Bermicourt: Since it seems you have access to several sources that I do not (probably just requires further digging), would you want to add them as inline citations with page numbers, especially to support the proposition regarding hundreds of people saved?

I'd be in favor instead of the hook being split into two separate proposals: one hook about the fact that she was an internet celebrity who grew up in a place without tap water, and a separate hook about her going viral for making hamburgers. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:23, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Full review needed, which can also address the issue of the borderline ALT1 hook. BlueMoonset (talk) 04:23, 5 November 2021 (UTC) As far as I can tell the article meets DYK requirements, and a QPQ has been done. Earwigs finds a close match with Coda Media, but that's only because it was the source for quotes in the article, and all of them are properly referenced. I find the first hook hard to believe given China's international standing, and in any case as brought up by Bowlhover may be inaccurate anyway. As for the second hook, as I mentioned before it's ineligible as it's exactly 200 characters long, and per WP:DYK hooks that are at or shorter than 200 characters may be rejected per reviewer's discretion. Both ALT0 and ALT1 have struck: I am repeating my earlier suggestion that ALT1 instead be split into two separate hooks. As this is a China-related article and there appear to be some political discussion in the article, I'd also like to ask for a second opinion from someone more knowledgeable about China-related articles if the article doesn't fall afoul of relevant guidelines. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 13:12, 6 November 2021 (UTC) From Wikipedia:Did you know#The hook: The hook should be concise: no more than about 200 characters (including spaces and the question mark, but not including the ..., the space immediately following the ..., or any (pictured)). While 200 is a hard limit, hooks near or at this limit may still be rejected at the discretion of reviewers and administrators. This tool can be used for counting words. The guideline says that "200 is a hard limit", so it is not true that the 200-character ALT1 hook is "ineligible" or "simply too long". No reason has been given for rejecting a 200-character hook "at the discretion of reviewers". Here are two additional hooks based on the suggestion: ALT2: ... that Dianxi Xiaoge, who grew up in a remote Yunnan mountain without running water, is an Internet celebrity with roughly 16 million subscribers on all her platforms? ALT3: ... Dianxi Xiaoge went viral in China and internationally after making hamburgers for her grandparents who had never eaten them before? Cunard (talk) 07:48, 7 November 2021 (UTC) Well for one thing, the original was very difficult to read and seemed to combine too many facts into one hook. Usually DYK prefers simpler hooks whenever possible. In any case, I think ALT3 is the best hook here and the nomination is otherwise good to go, I'd just like to hear a second opinion from another editor on the article tone given that I'm a bit uncomfortable doing a solo review here given the "Commentary" section delves into some political matters. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:36, 7 November 2021 (UTC) On second thought, I have some concerns regarding the length of the article. Isn't it rather detailed for an internet celebrity's page? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 11:10, 7 November 2021 (UTC) That the article is "rather detailed for an internet celebrity's page" should not be a concern. The sources provided substantial analysis of her and her work, and this article reflects those sources. Other detailed articles for Internet celebrities include PewDiePie and MrBeast. Cunard (talk) 11:18, 7 November 2021 (UTC) Pinging Gatoclass for his input, as he responded to a discussion I raised about this nomination over at WT:DYK. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:57, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I don't think we need Gatoclass to restate themself. Here's what they said at WT:DYK: The article doesn't use the phrase "one of only three Chinese influencers to gain international influence", so I'm not sure where you got that, but it does say she is one of only three "Chinese Internet celebrities who have reached international prominence", and the problem with that claim is that it's sourced to an article that is two years old and therefore not up-to-date. With regard to the overall length, I would agree that it is overly detailed and could use a trim. I'm not sure this is relevant to DYK however, as "overly detailed" is not one of our criteria. What I would say is that the level of detail does raise the chances of close paraphrasing so the article would need to be carefully checked for that. Anybody else with an opinion on this article?

Thriley (talk) 20:57, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @Thriley: I'll ping BlueMoonset here in case I'm wrong, but I'm going to say no, it isn't. My reasoning here is that if the hook were read as plaintext, without any bolding or linking, it would be read as pretty much only interesting as it concerns the plot. The hook should concern Smit's life; if it concerns her work as an actress, only stating her role and not anything about production doesn't make the hook out-of-universe. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 21:28, 17 November 2021 (UTC) theleekycauldron, I was taking a look at the ALT1 hook and its sources, and the second Biography sentence is basically copied from Esquire—the Google translate version, at any rate. That's a problem. Another problem is that the source doesn't actually say that she was working as a hotel receptionist when she got the call, just that it was "one of these jobs", referring back to the four in the previous sentence, none of which were hotel receptionist. The article also needs a bit of copyediting. I don't think that either of the plot-based hooks should be used, and as Drmies notes, "first film" is not accurate, since it's Cross the Line that's in the source, which appears to be her fifth film. We could only use "first feature film" if the previous four in her filmography were all short films (which would need to be clearly sourced). Perhaps an angle for the information in ALT1 would be to say she was working in whatever job it was when she was cast in Cross the Line, for which she was nominated as best new actress in the Goya Awards. BlueMoonset (talk) 02:31, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Here’s an article that states she was working as a receptionist two years before she was hired to work on Parallel Mothers:[6] Does it appear reliable? Thriley (talk) 05:38, 20 November 2021 (UTC) I don't see a reason to doubt the source. However, it isn't sufficient to support the "when she was called" hook claim, just that she was a hotel receptionist two years before the article was written (and possibly two years and a number of months, since you can't assume it's exactly two years). BlueMoonset (talk) 17:14, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Perhaps the hook should include all her various jobs before her Almodovar role? Thriley (talk) 01:47, 23 November 2021 (UTC) ALT3 “before starring in the Pedro Almodóvar film Parallel Mothers, Milena Smit worked as a model, waitress, shop assistant, babysitter, teleoperator, subway information assistant, and hotel receptionist?” El País Thriley (talk) 01:51, 23 November 2021 (UTC) That hook is 197 characters which puts it in discretionary territory.

I do like the hooks and it's an intriguing subject for an article! I wanted to flag the following comments, in case they are helpful (please ignore if not!): I don't quite follow this sentence in the lead: "Moreover, it is still pointed out that the emendation Albruna agrees with the names of other Germanic wise women." Should "instriptions" (before the Drusus heading) be "inscriptions"? Should the names of scholars be wikilinked, where there is a page for the author (e.g. Simek)? What does mss mean, and could this be explained when it is first referenced? The second paragraph of the Aurinia section has two sentences starting with "However" in a row, which is a bit awkward to read.

To be expected, since they're cited almost 20 times each, and since the vast majority of the matches concern long quotes I'm willing to overlook it, but can we add more citations throughout the paragraphs? Particularly with "Conflict with Miles and Reynolds", there's four citations crammed at the end of the section. I think we should cite each after the corresponding sentences, especially where there's a direct quotation.

Its long enough and new and lots of good refs - including the hook fact. It documents a notable woman from the 14th century and there were not many of those.

Nice addition. well done Victuallers (talk) 10:31, 6 November 2021 (UTC) Reopening this because I think the hook is misleading, as according to the source it was usual for women of the nobility, like Neville, to sign with their own names.

We don't need to say it's unusual if we phrase it that way theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 02:14, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Theleekycauldron, the problem with both hooks is that they imply that there was something out-of-the-ordinary in a woman signing something in her own name in that era, whereas the source indicates that was normal practice for women of the nobility. So the hooks are misleading. Gatoclass (talk) 02:19, 19 November 2021 (UTC) All right—I'll ping @Lajmmoore and Victuallers: back here, y'all can work this out. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 02:33, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Was it usual for women in the fourteenth century to sign with their own name ... no. Is is usual for women in the 21st century to sign with just their first name? No. So "did you know that unusually Canada's head of state signs documents with just her first name and an R for Regina?" (Someone shouts) "BUT all British Queens do that!!" (Someone shouts) "That implies that it was unusual for Queens to sign with just their first name." No it doesnt. I think @Gatoclass: is reading the source and then saying that the hook doesnt explain every piece of information in the source... which obviously it doesnt. Its unusual that "a woman" is doing this at all. It WAS unusual for women in the fourteenth century to sign and if they did then they did not usually use just their own name. Its a fact - its unusual. Did You know that women did not sign their own names on documents in the 14th century? No I didnt. That is something that Lajmmoore wrote about and now I know. Thanks. Victuallers (talk) 08:28, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Hello Gatoclass all so the part of the source I was using is this, which is talking about signatures for charitable donation "Although most of the widows declare themselves to be the wife of their late husband, or their father's daughter, others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names, such as 'domina Margareta de Longvl' and 'don-ýina Margareta de Nevill' (the same person). The majority of widows declare that their marital status and their power to act, using a variety of phrases, including 'in pura viduitate', 'in pura viduitate mea et ligia potestate', and 'in viduitate mea propria et potestate legitima' ..." and I read that as it was more usual for (noble) women to use a signature that described them as "wife of, etc..." I read the passage as Legg using Margaret de Neville as an unusual example. Legg is talking about the Coucher Book signatures specifically, but I still think they are marking out unusual practice. In terms of the hook, I wonder whether changing 'woman' to 'literate woman' might work? Lajmmoore (talk) 09:32, 19 November 2021 (UTC) No, it wouldn't work just to add "literate". And your reading of the text just amounts to an unsupported assumption on your part. Because while the text could admittedly be less ambiguous, the statement that others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names does not in any way suggest that it was rare or unusual for a member of the nobility to give their name, it only states that members of the nobility as a class were inclined to give their names. So there isn't sufficient support in that statement for a hook which implies that Neville's act was in any way unusual for a member of her class. The hook makes Neville sound like some sort of proto-feminist who boldly challenged the system, when the underlying source only indicates that either her entire class did the same thing, or at least that it was an accepted practice for members of the nobility. So I still think that either the hook needs to be substantially reworked to more closely reflect the source, or a new hook be found. Gatoclass (talk) 02:53, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks for sharing your interpretation of your text Gatoclass. My interpretation (& so the hook) is based on Legg's use of the word most - in that "most of the widows declare themselves to be the wife of their late husband, or their father's daughter" and you rightly point out "others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names" but I think that needs to be balanced by the "most" earlier in the sentence i.e. for women generally, they don't give their name, but some noble women do but overall, for women signing their name, it is unusual enough to be pointed out in the text.

Whispyhistory (talk) 04:04, 13 November 2021 (UTC) @Whispyhistory: But that would be impossible, the article can't possibly mention IP addresses, it's about broken toes.

It's okay with me if allowed (dyk says hook needs to be in article and in the following ref). Whispyhistory (talk) 06:32, 13 November 2021 (UTC) I don't see that exact sequence of numbers in the source, although there are others that look a bit like an IP address. The trouble is, the nominator seems to be the source for it looking a bit like an IP address, which it does, but we can't use that unless the source makes a similar point, which it does not appear to do. Something like this might work (numbers might need to be changed as mentioned): ALT1 ... that a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone may be described as 88.5.3.2? Philafrenzy (talk) 10:16, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Regarding the image, it's a fun idea but I don't think we run images as quizzes and the image is simply a skeletal foot, and not closely enough related to the hook.

I don't see how the hook you're suggesting is hooky. What exactly is wrong with the hook proposed? It's in the article and it's supported by the sources cited. And the image is directly related to the hook. It engages the reader into a spotting game. Dr. Vogel (talk) 14:57, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Like everyone else, I rather like the IP-address hook. If we wikilinked IP address, it would be supported in the linked articles, and fulfill the requirement that anyone following the links will be able to verify the hook. I don't think we need sourcing that says that a specific sequence of numbers is an IP address, as we have sources giving the general format of an IP address, and creating an example would be a trivial calculation ("Are all four of these numbers separated by periods in the range 0-255?"): "IPv4 and IPv6 address formats". www.ibm.com. An IPv4 address has the following format: x . x . x . x where x is called an octet and must be a decimal value between 0 and 255. Octets are separated by periods. An IPv4 address must contain three periods and four octets. The following examples are valid IPv4 addresses: 1 . 2 . 3 . 4 01 . 102 . 103 . 104 This hook is better than any alternative I can think of, and I don't see anything likely to be problematic about it (it's certainly verifiable). I think we might be in agreement on that? So if some rule technically prohibits it, we might have a good case for applying the WP:Ignore all the rules policy. Broken finger is also currently DYK-eligible and I think it uses the same numbering scheme.[1] HLHJ (talk) 02:07, 14 November 2021 (UTC) [edit: add fulltext url] I don't necessarily agree with the reading of WP:DYKCRIT 3b ( Each fact in the hook must be supported in the article by at least one inline citation to a reliable source [...]) that says that the IP thing needs to be in the article (compare e.g. Template:Did you know nominations/Urine deflector, which similarly took some creative licence in how the proposed hooks were phrased beyond what was stated in either the article or the cited source), and I agree with HLHJ that WP:IAR would be applicable regardless. As for the hooks themselves, writing "a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone may be described as 88.5.3.2" is a much poorer way of writing the hook (less "hooky") than the converse, i.e. "88.5.3.2 may refer to a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone". TompaDompa (talk) 11:28, 14 November 2021 (UTC) This. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 17:01, 16 November 2021 (UTC) We can't use IP address because the nominator just thought it up "oh, that looks like an IP address". It's not in the source as the nominator admits and therefore is not verifiable. And so what if it does look like an IP address? What does that tell us about broken toes? I like clever or quirky hooks and have written many (if I may say so), but they have to be based on something in the sources otherwise it's things made up one day. Philafrenzy (talk) 10:19, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you for all your comments. This is not the place to ignore all rules. The proposed hook is not supported by the source given in the article. I am inclined to approve ALT1 but it needs checking, unless another hook is proposed. Whispyhistory (talk) 15:11, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Oh dear, this has become contentious. I think the contended question is whether it's acceptable to have verified information not found in the nominated article, but only in another article, linked in the hook. Not as hooky, but for illustration: ALT3 ... that the dot-decimal notation string "88.5.3.2" is not only an an IPv4 address, but also a fracture in the middle of the bone at the tip of the little toe? "IPv4 and IPv6 address formats". www.ibm.com., Hallux proximal phalanx fracture in adults: an overlooked diagnosis I don't think we're debating whether the IP-address-hook statement is verifiable. The statement that "88.5.3.2" (and any number in that format) is a valid IPv4 address is supported by the IP address article and the IPv4 article, and this format is the subject of the Dot-decimal notation article. No-one had bothered to cite those statements in those articles, but since they've been challenged here, I've now cited them. So "88.5.3.2 is both an IP address[1] and a code for a broken toebone[2]" is certainly verifiable, and is now verified on Wikipedia. Any DYK reader should have no trouble verifying that the hook is accurate. Alternatives that do not mention IP addressees are not as hooky, but don't contain more information about broken toes: ALT4 ... that "88.5.3.2" is a toe fracture in the middle of the bone at the tip of the little toe, while a "78.5.3.2" is the parallel broken finger?

Philafrenzy (talk) 19:25, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you Philafrenzy ( a very experienced DYK contributor) for your efforts in helping new editors understand DYK. Your comment higher up about "88.5.3.2" and "ip address" not being in the source is true and I am grateful for your suggested alts. Essentially, the initial and subsequent hooks sound good, but none are in the article or the source. I don't wish for personal comments and don't mind if someone else wishes to take over here. With due respect @DrVogel: and @HLHJ:...You may wish to take this up at Wikipedia talk:Did you know. Whispyhistory (talk) 10:41, 15 November 2021 (UTC) I won't say I wish I hadn't written the article; I hope it's useful enough to make up for the social harm to the project here. I don't think the hostility was intended by anyone; I suspect that it's felt partly due to the ease of mininterpretation in a text-only medium and partly due to human cognitive biases.[2] I certainly did, and do, not intend it. I spent a day's editing trying to resolve the conflict by finding references specifically saying that the two things were in notation X and adding that text to the article, but unfortunately non-inductive descriptions of the notations seem to have been considered so needless that an Internet RFC attempting to formalize them died of disinterest. I did find a source that explicitly defines the IPv4 format, and one that explicitly says that 88.1.2.2 is a specific fracture, and I've cited the latter in the article, but I don't think this helps. It is probably a bit unreasonable to expect a reviewer to do more than apply rules as best they can, and Wikipedia talk:Did you know might indeed be a better forum for a more detailed discussion. I don't really want to take part in one, though (nothing to do with this discussion, prior reasons). I posted because I felt responsible for the conflict and thought I might be able to help. My impression is that I made it worse; my apologies to everyone I've offended. HLHJ (talk) 03:41, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Nobody is offended, but if I may say so I think you are still missing the point. IP addresses have nothing to do with broken toes even if that notation may have a similarity. That's why the sources don't make the comparison and why the IP-based hooks are no good. Any of the other hooks might be fine (I haven't checked the numbers) just without the bit about IP addresses. The whole thing reminds me of unusually shaped vegetables where you may see a carrot shaped like a foot, people who see faces in clouds, and even apophenia. My personal observation that one thing looks a bit like another is not the basis for a hook unless reliable sources make the point too. Philafrenzy (talk) 09:09, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Folks, we are wasting a wonderful hook. Really. IP addresses have nothing to do with broken toes even if that notation may have a similarity and that is the whole point of making good hooks. They are supposed to be short, punchy, catchy, and likely to draw the readers in to wanting to read the article – as long as they don't misstate the article content. And one of the best recipes to make a hook good is to make it sound counterintuitive With any other option but the original, we are bound to receive another hook frequented by maybe a few hundred visitors. I would propose something to the tune of in some contexts, 88.5.3.2 might not mean an IP address but a broken bone in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone? so that no one claims here that we somehow delegitimise the IP address but at the same time so that we preserve the core of the hook. As for the claims that because the hook is not cited in the IP part, it can't be there - please don't be that pedantic. In our today's world of informatics we may assume that people who visit Wikipedia more or less imagine what IP addresses are, and may more or less imagine how they look like (in the worst case they will visit the article for details). The other part is cited. I see no problem with the original. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 17:01, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Szmenderowiecki I admit that I'm not very familiar with the topic, and the above discussion was confusing, but is the "this isn't an IP address" claim actually in the source? Because if it's not, then no matter how good the hook proposal is, it can't be used in a hook since hook facts need to be based on a reference. Also, I'm pretty sure that assumptions don't count as sources. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:31, 17 November 2021 (UTC) What I was leading is that we don't need to cite that the sky is blue, or that we have five fingers; or that there exist IP addresses for that matter.

We're allowed to. This is not a massive occasion where we can save the whole project by breaking the rules. Its a trivial example of what some (not all) think may be a breach in the rules, with a small, but amusing, advantage. So I'm not asking the defenders of the rules to admit that this is not a breech ... I am suggesting that they might just concede that the harm done by allowing this hook might not offend anyone ... and it might please a few thousand. Victuallers (talk) 15:28, 20 November 2021 (UTC) We don't need to break the rules. The observation that the notation looks a bit like an IP address is trivial and completely unrelated to broken toes. There are already perfectly good hooks above that work better. Nobody is saying don't use the numbers, just strike the bit about IP addresses. The originally proposed hook is not the work of comic genius and cleverness that some seem to think it is. Philafrenzy (talk) 21:58, 20 November 2021 (UTC) The main issue here is that it's one of the core rules of DYK that hook facts must be mentioned in the article, ideally explicitly or at least implied by supporting information. The thing is that at the moment, IP addresses are not mentioned anywhere in the article, so the hooks using the IP address angle would be ineligible according to that criterion anyway. Even April Fools hooks, which tend to be misleading, are still generally based on hook facts that are mentioned in the respective articles. So if we can't even grant IAR exemptions for that criterion for AFD hooks, the one day of the year where our hooks tend to follow the rules most loosely, I can't see why such a request should be granted here.

Nominated by Victuallers (talk) at 16:21, 6 November 2021 (UTC). Article is new enough. Two correct writers are credited. The article is fully referenced. No copyvio detected. There is a bit of biased POV pushing in Wikipedia voice: "most vulnerable to climate change". This will be something our subject is saying no doubt. And this idea is also reflected in the hook with "endangered". The hook content is referenced and confirmed by the Guardian, apart from the "endangered" bit, which opinion is attributed to Tina Stege. So I suggest that "endangered" is taken out of the hook, or it is reworded so it is clear she is saying that. Hook alt1 is unsuitable as it does not link the article and I cannot tell what it is trying to say in relation to the subject. I can confirm image is CC-BY-3.0 as derived from the video with CC-BY-3.0 license. However I would suggest that a different image is selected from the video, perhaps near the end where the microphone is not obscuring her chin. QPQ is done. Graeme Bartlett (talk) 06:03, 15 November 2021 (UTC) @Graeme Bartlett: Thanks for the review Graeme - I have recut a new image. Surprised that "endangered" wasn't referenced. I'm not sure it is just her opinion -"Projected sea level rise would mean 40% of the buildings in the Marshall Islands’ capital of Majuro would be permanently flooded and entire islands would disappear, potentially costing the Pacific country its status as a nation, according to a devastating new report from the World Bank." is a quote from the reference I have added to balance the idea that "endangered" might by pov.

Graeme Bartlett (talk) 20:56, 22 November 2021 (UTC) @Graeme Bartlett: Are you suggesting that we imply that "endangered" is her opinion despite the fact that she represents a nation and the "endangered" aspect is supported by the World Bank and the Guardian newspaper (and the 1bn people estimated to be part of the "High Ambition" group ) saying so? Is there any evidence that is just her opinion and not that of her country and the World Bank? Am I missing something? It you feel you need to give this "a cross" then can I suggest that we ask for a new reviewer?I have suggested an alt that does not use the endangered word.

Self-nominated at 23:51, 4 November 2021 (UTC). @DferDaisy: This article is about 3300 bytes, and was nominated for DYK shortly after creation, satisfying date and length criteria. There is a factual error, as the article states she was interred in Keokuk, Illinois, but the source says she died in Chicago, Illinois and was interred in Keokuk, Iowa. I am assuming good faith for a few references I cannot access (for example, ref 15 - The National Humane Review), which for me gives a landing page for the document, instead of an inside view). Otherwise, everything is properly sourced and there are no copyvio or close paraphrasing concerns (Earwig cites 3 potential problems, but they are not an issue here.) QPQ not required. Regarding the hooks, ALT0 is incorrect as stated, as it reads as if the study was conducted in the early 1900s by Meigs Crowder, whereas she published it in 1917 based on studies from that period. It'll need minor alteration. ALT1 is fine and sourced. I would prefer to promote an amended ALT0. A minor quibble, though not an issue for DYK: please add page numbers for cited sources. If online access is eliminated from the sources, it'll force anyone investigating those sources to wade through too many pages to find the desired detail.

AleatoryPonderings (???) (!!!) 01:52, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @AleatoryPonderings: Yes, but note that this court case is the "leading case with respect to the issue of common employers", establishing a precedent in Canadian law. At the time the lawsuit was filed, this was not the case, and in fact the trial judge ruled against Alouche (see last paragraph of background section); it was only after the case was brought to the Court of Appeal for Ontario that the "common employer doctrine" was established, and it became entrenched when leave to appeal the decision at the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed. Mindmatrix 15:11, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Ah, so the idea behind the hook is that, since Downtown Eatery changed the law on common employers, before Downtown Eatery Best Beaver would not have been Alouche's employer? That makes more sense. AleatoryPonderings (???) (!!!) 15:20, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: I'm going to inspect this again... Mindmatrix 15:18, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @AleatoryPonderings: Alright, so to ensure everything is correct, the following timeline occurred: Alouche was hired to be manager at For Your Eyes Only (owned by Grad and Grosman), and began work on 29 December 1992 Alouche was sent a Notice of Discipline in May 1993, and was fired on 15 June 1993 In October 1993, Alouche filed action for wrongful dismissal against Best Beaver Management Inc., as that was the source of his paycheques Best Beaver ceased operations in mid-1996, and all assets distributed to other companies owned by Grad and Grosman The trial resolved in favour of Alouche Best Beaver did not pay out the judgement (all its assets had been redistributed) Sherriffs were dispatched to For Your Eyes Only, where they seized $1,855 Downtown Eatery filed claim against Alouche, stating the cash belonged to it Alouche defended, and counterclaimed against Grad, Grosman, and all companies they controlled on the grounds of common employer doctrine, the oppression remedy of the Ontario Business Corporations Act, and fraudulent conveyance the judge in the second trial (at Ontario Superior Court of Justice) ruled against Alouche the case was brought to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, where the previous ruling was overturned in 2001 in January 2002, an application for leave to appeal the decision at the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed So, the common employer doctrine was part of the second trial as a counterclaim to the suit filed by Downtown Eatery. I just wanted to ensure this satisfies your concerns. Mindmatrix 18:25, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks for this incredibly thorough response. My concern is maybe philosophical or definitional. If I say that company A employs person B, that has an ordinary meaning and a legal meaning. It is probably right that Best Beaver did not employ Alouche in the ordinary sense of "employ", because Best Beaver was a "paymaster" and not the name on the front of the building where he went to work. My reading of the case itself is that, before Downtown Eatery, it was at best indeterminate as a legal matter whether Best Beaver, alone or in combination with its affiliate companies, employed Alouche. After Downtown Eatery, it was established—as a matter of legal meaning, but not necessarily ordinary meaning—that Best Beaver was his employer, or part of his employer, or something like that. The reason I brought this up is that it's not clear how one could verify the claim that "Best Beaver was not Alouche's employer", because that claim might be true as a matter of ordinary meaning but the only authoritative legal ruling we have on this (namely, Downtown Eatery) holds that the claim is false. In any event, I'll leave this to the eventual reviewer to sort out. I find my brain twisting into knots. AleatoryPonderings (???)

Interesting: N - see below Other problems: N - see below QPQ: None required. Overall: Hello, Mungo and welcome to DYK! Review as follows: The article is new enough, long enough and neutral. However, it includes a WP:IMDB source and I am unsure about the reliability of several other sources, including Film Ink, Queer Media Matters, Antaeus.org, Fern TV, Addicted to Horror Movies, Dan's Papers, Go Mag, Three Women in a Box and North Coast Rep. To add to that, the YouTube link does not appear to be uploaded by an official channel, making it unreliable. Additionally, per MOS:FILMCAST uncredited roles need a source. the copyvio checker showed up a 50%+ similarity with a source, which may suggest over quotation. On top of that, the subject has unclear notability. I'm unsure which roles are significant and The House on Pine Street appears to have a questionable notability. None of her awards seem significant and I'm not seeing any significant coverage from reliable, independent sources. ALT0 isn't very interesting given the festival is not significant enough to have an article. I think ALT1 is interesting but it seems to focus more on the character, not the actress which isn't exactly ideal... QPQ not needed. We'll need some work but we'll get there!

Thanks, DanCherek. while the article is over 1,500 prose characters, I'm going to be a stickler and say that this is still a stub.

Moving on, the article was created from a redir and nominated in time and is neutral, although I'm requesting a second opinion on the sourcing. The article seems to be plagiarism free, and a QPQ has been done. As for the hook, I'm not sure it quite checks out—is the church expected to break away? Because the article just says that a vote is planned and expected. Once we clear those two up, we're good to go. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 02:41, 21 November 2021 (UTC) @Theleekycauldron: Not entirely sure what the concern on the sourcing is; there are multiple reputable sources. Also, the lede is fairly clear that this is a planned schism, as the hook says. While I appreciate the review, I am dissatisfied with your effort.

Thanks! ~ Pbritti (talk) 05:10, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Isn't there a difference between "planned" (alt1) and "expected" (alt0)? planned implies it may or may not happen, expected is like forecasting—at least, that's how i read it. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 05:19, 21 November 2021 (UTC) @Theleekycauldron: Merriam-Webster considers them definitionally synonymous terms (see definition 2).

Maximilian Dood ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that in August 2021, YouTuber Maximilian Dood's viral social media campaign for Marvel vs. Capcom 2's rerelease caught the regards of studio Digital Eclipse, who expressed interest in rereleasing the game? Source: 1 and 2 Comment: This is the first time I’ve ever made a DYK here, so here goes. I personally find this fact interesting because it highlights how the advent of YouTube, and internet fame in general, has allowed people to use their voice to reach people in positions of high influence, bringing hidden ideas to light and advocating for change. While this specific example falls under a video game/pop-culture category, and may not fit Wikipedia’s desire for academic material, I feel that this is interesting enough to share, as it’s one the gaming community can relate to, like with other social media trends such as #FreeSmash and "Rerelease Mother 3." As for the article itself, all of the citations should be reliable enough; they’re all from third-party/secondary source outlets and there isn’t any BLP violation to be found here. One concern I have is criteria #3 - “Each fact in the hook must be supported in the article by at least one inline citation to a reliable source, appearing no later than the end of the sentence(s) offering that fact. Citations at the end of the paragraph are not sufficient.” While the hook is sourced in the article, the refs are at the end of the section rather than per each sentence. I can fix that however. Anyway, I hope this fact does get accepted! If not, I understand, thanks for reviewing this anyway. Created/expanded by PantheonRadiance (talk). Self-nominated at 08:45, 17 November 2021 (UTC).

Article is new enough, very newsworthy event and hence well-sourced, no copyvios (Earwig reports a false positive on the Johnson quotation), QPQ done.

Newness requirement satisfied by 5x expansion on 11/15 from < 600 to > 3000 characters. Articles also long enough and compliant with core policies on citations and neutrality. The hook is in-line sourced. Photo has appropriate license. QPQ is done. There are, however, two problems: (1) There is some significant overlap with this source. To start, the following sentence is taken from the source without use of quotation marks and with no effort to paraphrase rather than use the precise words: "Local advocacy led to the establishment of Bridle Trails as a state park in 1932." Further, this sentence also strikes me as too closely drawn from the same source: "Initial park development dates to 1933 when Civil Works Administration employees and federal relief workers were employed in state parks as part of the New Deal program. Further work included burning logging debris, clearing brush and building trails and fences." Work needs to be done to put the material into your own words. (2) The hook strikes me as boring in that it states an obvious point. Horses having the right of way on this trail is not unique or special. On trails that are shared by humans and horses, it is the general rule that horses have the right of way. See here ("In general, horses always have the right of way, followed by hikers, then by bikers."). See also here ("For safety reasons, if you come across a horse and rider on any trail they always have right of way. Hikers and bike riders all yield to horses.")

For one, the quote is not actually "could have been made by aliens" so, considering this is all about misquotation, we should either use the actual quote or clarify that it is a misquotation.

Graham87 09:41, 18 November 2021 (UTC) @Gerda Arendt: Thank you for the review. Diamonds were often cut in cabochon style in the 19th century and earlier. This one was cut with a flat bottom like all cabochons, and when viewed from above, it was a large oval, about 1.5 inches long. Modern cabochons usually have a smoothly rounded surface; this one was lightly faceted but the facets don't show on the sculpture. So it looks like half an egg, I suppose. The Koh-i-Noor is the large oval at the bottom of the picture. We have no specific citation for artistic licence - that is just a conclusion that we can probably make, since we have no evidence that Victoria ever had it set in a necklace. Therefore I cannot use "artistic licence" in a hook or in the article. I'll have a go at a hook using a full-length Victoria, and another hook using the Warrior and Wounded Youth sculpture. I'll come back shortly with those.

As for the hooks, I'm going to reject ALT0 out of hand, because Ben Comeau can take a number on that one. I'm also going to say no to ALT1, not because it's uncivil or uninteresting, but because it should be quoted—I've suggested two minor alts. A QPQ is also needed.

I've been trying to come up with something catchy on this -- for example, had Comeau invited Trump to participate in a performance of the work, then we could say he told Trump to fugue himself -- but the sourcing just isn't there that I can see. In consolation, here's an enlightening bit of musical history you will want to share with friends and family: Q: Why did Bach have so many children?

EEng 16:47, 17 November 2021 (UTC) The video for "Boris Johnson is a Lying Shit" includes a description from Comeau that basically screams for people not to vote for him, and the one for "Donald Trump is a Wanker" says "As satisfying as it is to poke fun at the Orange Monster, this video on its own probably won’t do the teeniest thing to reduce the devastation inflicted by the Trump administration. I therefore want to use this platform to suggest ways we can contribute to meaningful anti-Trump resistance.". We'd need to flesh out the article with these WP:BLPPRIMARY sources for the "thinks" to be properly verifiable.

Did you know that a recently discovered 1692 libretto of an actual Abendmusik bears similarities to Wacht! Euch zum Streit?[1][2]. Or that the Abendmusiken were actually presented right after Vespers?[3] Vespers, which themselves lasted two or three hours, in addition to a further three or four hour Hauptgottesdienst in the morning?[4][5] That might be one of the reasons why the audience was reported to be so disorderly, to the point that the town watch had to be hired to maintain a semblance of order.[6] That, and a lot more, which would surely allow to take this to DYK at a later time, after having greatly expanded this. Or at least, it's my opinion that taking the sole opportunity for DYK now would be a waste when it can be done when the article is expanded and made into something significantly more attractive and informative.

Fact is, I have the score and the whole text (including in translation) with me, in addition to lots of critical commentary on the piece itself (too much of which is focused on the question of authenticity, but alas...) and on the Abendmusiken in general. This can be used to make a proper article, but it would require time, which at the moment I really need to put into meeting an actual deadline than here. I've given you a list of pertinent sources (many of which are in German, if that's easier for you), if you're interested you know where to ask. On top of all of that, there's the question of article title (should it be at the current one or at Wacht! Euch zum Streit gefasset macht (a title which is used in a fair amount of sources, too...) Cheers, RandomCanadian (talk / contribs) 00:01, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Short version of what I replied on my talk: The time for it is in Advent. This year or next, that is the question. I'm also busy with other things, and both your familiarity with the topic, and your better English, make me wish you did it. For DYK, just raising attention is the goal. If you want it GA, we probably better wait. You decide. --Gerda Arendt (talk) 07:50, 22 November 2021 (UTC) The title: Wikipedia goes by the common title, and the other (and probably more) should be redirects.

Overall: Article meets eligibility criteria. i.e newness and article length. Article is well sourced and is neutral in tone. Hook is interesting and is cited. Copyvio scores ~20% in major part due to a quote that has been attributed rightly. However, the nominator might want to consider removing the quote and rewriting the sentence because the original Nepal Times article does not have it as a quote and is likely a paraphrasing done by the newspaper to begin with. Hence, we should not include it as a quote. In addition, I would encourage the nominator to consider expanding the article - to be clear, the article is good to go as-is. But looking at Hanuman Dhoka for instance there is an opportunity to build this article more than just a "History" section. Handing it back to the nominator. Some work and this is ready for homepage.

According to page 217 of "Account of the Late Granville Sharp...", Sharp approached Robert Kite, who is listed as lord mayor for only 1766. Can you reconcile those date discrepancies? (I do see that the Hochschild ref mentions the event as 2 years later from 1765, so there is some inconsistency in the reference material too.)

Further information: Official supplementary guidelines and unofficial guide  Warning: You are not logged in. Please create an account or log in to proceed. Alternatively, you may leave a message at the bottom of the DYK project talk page with the article you would like to nominate and the hook you would like to propose.  Warning: The helper script only works on desktop. Please switch to desktop view to continue. Install the DYK helper script by adding the line {{subst:lusc|User:SD0001/DYK-helper.js}} to your common.js page. Go back to the article, and choose the "DYK" option from the "More" menu (see image). Fill in the form and submit it. Check back periodically to address comments or concerns from the reviewer (it may take several weeks). Manual instructions[edit] Create a subpage for your new DYK suggestion and then list the page below under the date the article was created or the expansion began or it became a good article (not the date you submit it here), with the newest dates at the bottom. Any registered user may nominate a DYK suggestion (if you are not a registered user, please leave a message at the bottom of the DYK project talk page with the details of the article you would like to nominate and the hook you would like to propose); self-nominations are permitted and encouraged. Thanks for participating and please remember to check back for comments on your nomination (consider watchlisting your nomination page). Read these instructions completely before proceeding. For simplified instructions, see User:Rjanag/Quick DYK 2. I. Create the nomination subpage. Enter the article title in the box below and click the button. (To nominate multiple articles together, enter any or all of the article titles.) You will then be taken to a preloaded nomination page. II. Write the nomination. On the nomination page, fill in the relevant information. See Template:NewDYKnomination and {{NewDYKnomination/guide}} for further information. Not every line of the template needs to be filled in. For instance, if you are not nominating an image to appear with your hook, there is no need to fill in the image-related lines. Add an edit summary e.g. "Nominating YOUR ARTICLE TITLE for DYK" and click Publish page. Make sure the nomination page is on your watchlist, so you can follow the review discussion. III. Post at Template talk:Did you know. In the current nominations section find the subsection for the date on which the article was created or on which expansion began (or, if a new Good Article, the date on which it became a GA), not the date on which you make the nomination. At the top of that subsection (before other nominations already there, but below the section head and hidden comment) add {{Did you know nominations/YOUR ARTICLE TITLE}}. Add an edit summary e.g. "Nominating YOUR ARTICLE TITLE for DYK" and click Publish page. Frequently asked questions[edit] How do I write an interesting hook? Successful hooks tend to have several traits. Most importantly, they share a surprising or intriguing fact. They give readers enough context to understand the hook, but leave enough out to make them want to learn more. They are written for a general audience who has no prior knowledge of or interest in the topic area. Lastly, they are concise, and do not attempt to cover multiple facts or present information about the subject beyond what's needed to understand the hook. When will my nomination be reviewed? This page is often backlogged. As long as your submission is still on the page, it will stay there until an editor reviews it. Since editors are encouraged to review the oldest submissions first, it may take several weeks until your submission is reviewed. In the meantime, please consider reviewing another submission (not your own) to help reduce the backlog (see instructions below). Where is my hook? If you can't find the nomination you submitted to this nominations page, it may have been approved and is on the approved nominations page waiting to be promoted. It could also have been added to one of the prep areas, promoted from prep to a queue, or is on the main page. If the nominated hook is in none of those places, then the nomination has probably been rejected. Such a rejection usually only occurs if it was at least a couple of weeks old and had unresolved issues for which any discussion had gone stale. If you think your nomination was unfairly rejected, you can query this on the DYK discussion page, but as a general rule such nominations will only be restored in exceptional circumstances. Instructions for reviewers[edit] Main page: Wikipedia:Did you know/Reviewing guide Any editor who was not involved in writing/expanding or nominating an article may review it by checking to see that the article meets all the DYK criteria (long enough, new enough, no serious editorial or content issues) and the hook is cited. Editors may also alter the suggested hook to improve it, suggest new hooks, or even lend a hand and make edits to the article to which the hook applies so that the hook is supported and accurate. For a more detailed discussion of the DYK rules and review process see the supplementary guidelines and the WP:Did you know/Reviewing guide. To post a comment or review on a DYK nomination, follow the steps outlined below: Look through this page, Template talk:Did you know, to find a nomination you would like to comment on. Click the "Review or comment" link at the top of the nomination. You will be taken to the nomination subpage. The top of the page includes a list of the DYK criteria. Check the article to ensure it meets all the relevant criteria. To indicate the result of the review (i.e., whether the nomination passes, fails, or needs some minor changes), leave a signed comment on the page. Please begin with one of the 5 review symbols that appear at the top of the edit screen, and then indicate all aspects of the article that you have reviewed; your comment should look something like the following: Article length and age are fine, no copyvio or plagiarism concerns, reliable sources are used. But the hook needs to be shortened. If you are the first person to comment on the nomination, there will be a line :* <!-- REPLACE THIS LINE TO WRITE FIRST COMMENT, KEEPING  :* --> showing you where you should put the comment. Save the page. If there is any problem or concern about a nomination, please consider notifying the nominator by placing {{subst:DYKproblem|Article|header=yes|sig=yes}} on the nominator's talk page. Instructions for project members[edit] How to promote an accepted hook[edit] At-a-glance instructions on how to promote an approved hook to a Prep area See Wikipedia:Did you know/Preparation areas for details on verifying a hook's acceptability. Promoters should not promote their own nomination or their own review When promoting hooks intended for a particular date, keep in mind that when the number of available approved nominations exceeds 120 we switch to two sets per day, and when that number drops below 60 we return to one set per day. Check list for nomination review completeness 1) Select a hook from the approved nominations page that has one of these ticks at the bottom post: . 2) Check to make sure basic review requirements were completed. a. Any outstanding issue following needs to be addressed before promoting. 3) Check the article history for any substantive changes since it was nominated or reviewed. 4) Images for the lead slot must be freely licensed. Fair-use images are not permitted. Images loaded on Commons that appear on the Main Page are automatically protected by KrinkleBot. 5) Hook must be stated in both the article and source (which must be cited at the end of the article sentence where stated). 6) Hook should make sense grammatically. 7) Try to vary subject matters within each prep area. 8) Try to select a funny, quirky or otherwise upbeat hook for the last or bottom hook in the set. Steps to add a hook to prep In one tab, open the nomination page of the hook you want to promote. In a second tab, open the prep set you intend to add the hook to. 1) For hooks held for specific dates, refer to "Local update times" section on DYK Queue. a. Completed Prep area number sets will be promoted by an administrator to corresponding Queue number. 2) Copy and paste the hook into a chosen slot. a. Make sure there's a space between ... and that, and a ? at the end. b. Check that there's a bold link to the article. 3) If it's the lead (first) hook, paste the image where indicated at the top of the template. 4) Copy and paste ALL the credit information (the {{DYKmake}} and {{DYKnom}} templates) at the bottom 5) Check your work in the prep's Preview mode. a. At the bottom under "Credits", to the right of each article should have the link "View nom subpage" ; if not, a subpage parameter will need to be added to the DYKmake. 6) Save the Prep page. Closing the DYK nomination page At the upper left Change {{DYKsubpage to {{subst:DYKsubpage Change |passed= to |passed=yes At the bottom Just above the line containing }}<!--Please do not write below this line or remove this line. Place comments above this line.--> insert a new, separate line containing one of the following: To [[T:DYK/P1|Prep 1]] To [[T:DYK/P2|Prep 2]] To [[T:DYK/P3|Prep 3]] To [[T:DYK/P4|Prep 4]] To [[T:DYK/P5|Prep 5]] To [[T:DYK/P6|Prep 6]] To [[T:DYK/P7|Prep 7]] Also paste the same thing into the edit summary. Check in Preview mode. Make sure everything is against a pale blue background (nothing outside) and there are no stray characters, like }}, at the top or bottom. Save. For more information, please see T:TDYK#How to promote an accepted hook. Handy copy sources: To [[T:DYK/P1|Prep 1]] To [[T:DYK/P2|Prep 2]] To [[T:DYK/P3|Prep 3]] To [[T:DYK/P4|Prep 4]] To [[T:DYK/P5|Prep 5]] To [[T:DYK/P6|Prep 6]] To [[T:DYK/P7|Prep 7]] How to remove a rejected hook[edit] Open the DYK nomination subpage of the hook you would like to remove. (It's best to wait several days after a reviewer has rejected the hook, just in case someone contests or the article undergoes a large change.) In the window where the DYK nomination subpage is open, replace the line {{DYKsubpage with {{subst:DYKsubpage, and replace |passed= with |passed=no. Then save the page. This has the effect of wrapping up the discussion on the DYK nomination subpage in a blue archive box and stating that the nomination was unsuccessful, as well as adding the nomination to a category for archival purposes. How to remove a hook from the prep areas or queue[edit] Edit the prep area or queue where the hook is and remove the hook and the credits associated with it. Go to the hook's nomination subpage (there should have been a link to it in the credits section). View the edit history for that page Go back to the last version before the edit where the hook was promoted, and revert to that version to make the nomination active again. Add a new icon on the nomination subpage to cancel the previous tick and leave a comment after it explaining that the hook was removed from the prep area or queue, and why, so that later reviewers are aware of this issue. Add a transclusion of the template back to this page so that reviewers can see it. It goes under the date that it was first created/expanded/listed as a GA. You may need to add back the day header for that date if it had been removed from this page. If you removed the hook from a queue, it is best to either replace it with another hook from one of the prep areas, or to leave a message at WT:DYK asking someone else to do so. How to move a nomination subpage to a new name[edit] Don't; it should not ever be necessary, and will break some links which will later need to be repaired. Even if you change the title of the article, you don't need to move the nomination page. Nominations[edit] Older nominations[edit] Articles created/expanded on September 2[edit] Articles created/expanded on September 27[edit] Roman campaigns in Germania (12 BC – AD 16) ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that the Romans won a series of campaigns against the Germanic tribes following the disaster at Teutoburg, but decided to leave Germany because its land was not considered valuable? Source: Wells (2003), The Battle That Stopped Rome, pp. 206–7 Improved to Good Article status by SpartaN (talk). Self-nominated at 03:34, 29 September 2021 (UTC). General eligibility: New Enough: Y Long Enough: Y Other problems: Y Policy compliance: Adequate sourcing: Y Neutral: Y Free of copyright violations, plagiarism, and close paraphrasing: Y Other problems: Y Hook eligibility: Cited: N - Source is offline but happy to AGF. However, in the article the statement “they considered German lands too poor for annexation” is sourced to p.204 of Wells. pp.206-7 referred to above is used to support that they that “it was too costly in economic and military resources” to go into in Germany. I guess either way the hook is sourced but could you clarify the exact sourcing of the hook. Interesting: Y QPQ: None required. Overall: Interesting thorough article, well-written with good quality sourcing. Earwig shows no issues. Just a minor query around the hook sourcing but otherwise will be good to go. DeCausa (talk) 08:23, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @DeCausa: I found the web link that (for me) shows a preview if you're able to see it: https://books.google.com/books?id=mc30CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA206&lpg=PA206 SpartaN (talk) 10:07, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @SpartaN: Thanks for providing the link. It’s prompted a couple of thoughts for me. Firstly, Wells doesn’t seem to be saying the reason for the withdrawal is definitively known (“… the reasons for these decisions must have lain…”) i.e he’s making an assumption, however well founded. The hook is more definite than Wells is. Secondly, Wells’ emphasis is on the strength of the resistance being behind the reason - the poor value of the territory makes it “not worth it” because of the strength of the resistance. That’s not quite the same as just saying the land wasn’t valuable. (I notice the text you used in the article on this reflects that effort/value ratio issue.) To fix both points would you be prepared to consider an ALT1 which after “…Teutoburg” continues something along the lines of “…likely decided to leave Germany because the military effort was out of proportion to the territory’s value?” although there may need to be some trimming to get it into the 200 character limit. DeCausa (talk) 11:12, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @SpartaN and DeCausa: It's been over a month since the last comments here, have there been any updates? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:31, 13 November 2021 (UTC) From my point of view I’m waiting for SpartaN’s reply to my last post here. But I notice they haven’t edited Wikipedia since then, over a month ago. So I’m not quite sure what can be done. DeCausa (talk) 08:17, 13 November 2021 (UTC) I see. Given that there's really only one issue holding the nomination back, would anyone be willing to adopt this in case SpartaN doesn't return? It would be a shame if the nomination failed at this point. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 06:35, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I’m not sure what exactly are the DYK rules on this but, subject to that, options could be (a) I propose an ALT1 hook and someone else signs it off; (b) someone else proposes an ALT1 hook and I sign it off; (c) if anyone disagrees with me on the original hook I’m happy to step away and they sign it off. DeCausa (talk) 11:04, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I've looked at the Wells source and concur that it is saying the withdrawal was more down to the ratio of effort required to potential reward, and have boldly tweaked the copy in the article to reflect this. For what it's worth, I think ALT1 works just fine. firefly ( t · c ) 11:16, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Ok. I’m just going to formalize the ALT1 and let someone else add the tick and sign off: ALT1:... that the Romans won a series of campaigns against the Germanic tribes after the disaster at Teutoburg but likely decided to leave Germany as the effort was out of proportion to the territory’s value? DeCausa (talk) 12:07, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Since the reviewer has proposed a new hook, another editor will be needed to sign this off. I'm not sure though if the section linking in the bold links is allowed, however. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:29, 15 November 2021 (UTC) sorry, I missed that. It’s not even necessary to link to a section of the article so I’ve taken it out of ALT1. DeCausa (talk) 08:21, 15 November 2021 (UTC) As this doesn’t seem to be moving I’m going to give ALT1 the tick as original reviewer. If the DYK regulars think this is out of process because I came up nwith ALT1 then happy for it to be reverted. DeCausa (talk) 22:46, 21 November 2021 (UTC) DeCausa, there is no rush to approve, and your approval of your own hook was indeed out of process. I have reverted SL93's promotion of the nomination to prep, and with any luck a new reviewer will be around soon enough to review your ALT1. (SL93, you're welcome to review it, but that means you cannot also promote it.) I've also struck the original hook due to the issues noted above. BlueMoonset (talk) 04:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) BlueMoonset Sorry for mixing up who approved it. SL93 (talk) 04:26, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I didn't notice the second sentence of the approval...not sure how that happened. Sorry, again. SL93 (talk) 04:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) DeCausa Reading through the article again, your ALT1 hook seems to be mostly verifed in the Aftermath section, but I'm not seeing any indication of it being "likely". SL93 (talk) 21:14, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, that’s true. Where that came from was, in the above discussion with SpartaN on the original hook, they cited Wells in support. Wells says, in relation to Tiberius’ decision to ‘give up’, that “The reason for these decisions must have lain in the Germans’ tough resistance”. I’ve taken that to mean Wells’ was inferring Tiberius’ reasoning without direct evidence (or certainty) of Tiberius’ actual reason. However, you’re right that the way the article is written is more certain. I’m ok striking the “likely” or, possibly it would be better to amend the final sentence of the first paragraph of the Aftermath section to be more reflectve of Wells. DeCausa (talk) 21:48, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I will leave this here for someone else to look at. It would be helpful if the nominator came back. SL93 (talk) 23:21, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Articles created/expanded on October 9[edit] Pankratius Pfeiffer ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that Salvatorian priest Pankratius Pfeiffer saved hundreds of Jews in Rome during the Second World War? Reviewed: 1936 Northeast Flood Created by Ergo Sum (talk). Self-nominated at 17:52, 9 October 2021 (UTC). New article that was created on 9 October 2021? is 3,212 characters and nominated on the same day. No copyvios detected and duplication detector of [1][2][3][4][5] reveal no close paraphrasing issues (AGF PDF docs which can't go through Dup detector). Article is well-sourced. Hook is 103 characters long (under 200 character max.) and is interesting. Refs 4 and 5 (verifying the hook) are reliable sources. QPQ done. Looks good to go! —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:41, 9 October 2021 (UTC) Too many red flags here. If he really saved hundreds of Jews, you would expect plenty of confirmation of this in scholarly sources and him to be recognized by Yad Vashem. I can't count the number of times that I've seen mainstream newspapers print completely false stories about Jews being rescued during the holocaust, so better sources are definitely needed to confirm these extraordinary claims. Thanks Brigade Piron for letting me know about this. (t · c) buidhe 16:51, 10 October 2021 (UTC) I have to admit I'm just a bit perplexed by the argument. Except in fairly uncommon cases of multiple RS that contradict each other, we don't generally recognize any "hierarchy" of reliable sources. Sources are either RS or they are not. So I'm not sure what kind of sources you have in mind as "better" sources. The ones currently cited in the article are all RS, so that should be the end of it. I might add that if you seek some manner of official imprimatur in the vein of Yad Vashem, the City of Rome named a street after him. Your point about why there isn't more extensive coverage of this historical figure is well taken but can easily be attributed to the fact that all manner of historical figures are lost to history, especially those who are notable really for one major event in their life that did not come to light until years later, as is the case here. Indeed, one of the RS in this article describes Pfeiffer as being "lost to history." I'm adding the new review icon here so that we can get at least one more editor's evaluation of this. Ergo Sum 13:32, 16 October 2021 (UTC) There are very few people who actually saved hundreds of Jews during the Holocaust and plenty of hoaxes that were reported as truth by various news organizations—for example Necdet Kent. In other cases, actual rescue did occur but the numbers are greatly exaggerated and repeated uncritically by news organizations, such as Raoul Wallenberg. If the story is true you would expect to see it covered in many more credible sources. There are plenty of cases where a source is reliable for some info but not others. For example, someone's CV is often reliable for "they worked at X organization" but not "they are a world expert in Z". Extraordinary claims require extraordinary sourcing. (t · c) buidhe 21:27, 16 October 2021 (UTC) I should say that I share Buidhe's concerns. I think saying that "all manner of historical figures are lost to history" rather side-steps the sheer volume of historical scholarship on all aspects of the Holocaust. On a more banal note, I think part of the problem is that the sources cited are, essentially, all journalistic sources published by explicitly Catholic or Salvatorian outlets. The specific sources cited for the "saved" claim are Romereports (I am not familiar with this outlet, but the typo in the video does not inspire confidence) and a self-published Salvatorian newsletter. Neither are scholarly sources and both are, again, explicitly confessional in nature. I think WP:BIASED may on point in a highly sensitive issue touching on the wider disputes about Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust. Do we know what the Samerski book says, for example? —Brigade Piron (talk) 08:55, 17 October 2021 (UTC) Buidhe It is true that the sources cover Catholic issues, but only the Salvatorian one is actually published by a Catholic institution. I need not go into how varied Catholic newspapers are in their adherence/faithfulness to the Catholic hierarchy and beliefs (see e.g. National Catholic Reporter versus National Catholic Register). But more direclty, there actually are many scholarly RS that discussion Pfeiffer and his works in Nazi-occupied Rome. You will find them on the other language versions of this article. The problem is that I do not read Italian or German well enough to use them in the article. Coverage is not the issue. It is English language coverage. Ergo Sum 13:48, 17 October 2021 (UTC) @Ergo Sum: perhaps add the word "reportedly" before "saved". I'm inclined to accept in good faith the sources used as reliable – none of them have not been deprecated nor deemed generally unreliable. —Bloom6132 (talk) 16:41, 26 October 2021 (UTC) DYK should not cover unconfirmed reports or rumors so I strongly disagree with that suggestion. As well as assuming sources are reliable if they've never been discussed at WP:RSN, which disregards important parts of WP:RS such as WP:CONTEXTMATTERS. There is no issue with citing sources in Italian or German, but if it's not confirmed that they support the content then it's incorrect to assume that they do. (t · c) buidhe 20:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Bloom6132: I tend to think that statements are either supported by RS and written in wikivoice or they're not accepted at all. For that reason, I shy away from words like "reportedly." I reiterate though that I think it's quite clear there's nothing wrong with the sources currently used. They're all RS, so that should be the end of it. Hence, why I think your initial review was satisfactory. Ergo Sum 23:40, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Ergo Sum: agreed. I'm still of the view that the hook satisfies criteria 3b. Criteria 4 states that "Nominations should be rejected if an inspection reveals that they are not based on reliable sources". That is not the case here. —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) You're still ignoring the principle in RS that context matters, and some sources are reliable for some but not other info. The two of us who actually write on Holocaust related topics have expressed that the sources cited are not reliable for the exceptional claims being made. (t · c) buidhe 23:59, 26 October 2021 (UTC) With all due respect, I am of the opinion that the sources used are reliable for the info in the hook. The fact that you and Brigade Piron write on Holocaust-related topics is irrelevant – it does not confer a veto over hooks pertaining to that subject. By that logic, I should be able to veto baseball or heraldry hooks ... —Bloom6132 (talk) 01:10, 27 October 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: Three of my DYKs promoted (including Coat of arms of the Falkland Islands from August this year) have included the word "reportedly" in the hook, as well as numerous hooks from other editors. Disagree all you want – this is accepted practice at DYK. —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: I'm aware that you have experience writing about Holocaust-related articles and I put value in your assessment as a solid editor. However, I'm quite comfortable in my ability to vet RS, as well, and my confidence in these sources means I must disagree with your opinion here. Experienced editors do disagree at times, and it is my opinion that I think you have gotten this one wrong; doubtless, you think the same for me. I haven't seen any evidence that these are not RS. Therefore, I recommend if Bloom6132 is inclined to do so, to renew their approval of the hook. In the meantime, I'm going to request the input of additional experienced editors on the DYK talk page. Ergo Sum 01:28, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm going to ping @Bamse, Bermicourt, Jmabel, and Anyfile to see if we can find some reliable sources in other languages. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 01:46, 27 October 2021 (UTC) Oops, @AnyFile theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 01:47, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm currently traveling & very busy, so not much help here, I'm afraid. - Jmabel | Talk 01:53, 27 October 2021 (UTC) That said, more or less this same case is made in The Pope's Jews: The Vatican's Secret Plan to Save Jews from the Nazis by Gordon Thomas (not currently cited in the article). - Jmabel | Talk 02:00, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm unclear as to why the cited sources are unreliable: are we assuming that all information emanating from a Roman Catholic source is unreliable? If so what's the logic? In any case there are dozens of book sources in English, German, French and Italian that mention Pfeiffer, the problem is that few are accessible online. One is an entire biography of Pfeiffer "from baker to Vatican diplomat" which would be useful to track down: Willer, Philomena (2005). P. Pankratius Pfeiffer SDS: (1872-1945); vom Bäckergesellen zum Vatikandiplomat. Pub: Josef Fink. Others that mentions Pfeiffer and the Jews in Rome are: Liebhart (1996) Schwangau. Meding (1992), Flucht vor Nürnberg. Sinn (1976), Illegal. Bermicourt (talk) 08:41, 27 October 2021 (UTC) My issue is with the unreliability of journalistic works and popular history, which have in many cases published inaccurate information about rescues of Jews during the Holocaust. If better sources exist, they should be cited instead. An additional question is, do these sources actually support the claim of "hundreds" of Jews rescued by Pfeiffer personally? (t · c) buidhe 08:51, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I've now found sources that cover most of the article. Here are more: Liebhart (1996) Schwangau. Meding (1992), Flucht vor Nürnberg. Sinn (1976), Illegal. Prince Constantine of Bavaria (1952) Der Papst. Layer (1985), Schwäbisches Ehrenbuch - Pfeiffer credited with "saving Rome and other Italian cities including Chieti, Ascoli and Ovieto from destruction and other calamities" _ (1999). Publik-Forum - Pfeiffer the only German to have a street named after him in Rome and who fought to save Roman Jews. _ (1960). Bayerische Frömmigkeit - Pfeiffer described as the "Saviour of Rome and other cities in Italy" Robert Katz has written a number of books - Death in Rome (1967), Black Sabbath (1969), The Battle for Rome (2010) - which all mention Pfeiffer. Bottum and Dalin (2004). The Pius War has this interesting piece: "7. Pancrazio [sic] Pfeiffer. According to Carroll-Abbing, one of the men used by Pius XII to protest the Nazi roundup of Rome's Jews and intervene for persecuted victims was Father Pancrazio Pfeiffer, superior general of the Salvatorian Fathers, who also served as Pius XII' personal liaison to the German military command in Rome. Because Pfeiffer died tragically in an automobile accident toward the end of the war and thus never took part in the postwar analysis of Pius XII's conduct, many historians have overlooked him. But those who knew him or have researched his life have chronicled his collaborative efforts with Pius XII to rescue Jews and others during the war. See the article "Pfeiffer's List" by Robert Graham, 30 Days, June 1994, pp. 42-46. Prince Constantine of Bavaria's book on Pius XII, The Pope (London: Allan Wingate, 1954) [listed above] contains an excellent section on Pfeiffer, whom he describes as an agent for the pope on behalf of the victims of persecution and the fugitives in hiding" (p. 213). At Pfeiffer's death in May 1945, Vatican Radio paid tribute: "He came into contact with the Commander of the German occupying forces [in Rome in 1943-44]. From that day onwards, he placed his religious and spiritual qualities at the service of many who had been arrested or already condemned to death. He helped countless people in this way, and saved their lives, among them many Jews and other Italian personages. He championed..." In short there seems to be book evidence for virtually everything stated in the article apart from the specific details of the two incidents where 249 or 400 Jews were rescued. Based on my initial searches my expectation is that those incidents are likely to be recorded in the literature - we just need to be able to access more of the sources. Meanwhile there is no harm in pausing to use some of the above sources, plus those I've added to the Further reading section of the article in order to reinforce the existing references and then review where we are.

For example, Salvatorians USA Province is not independent of the article subject and therefore is not reliable for self-serving assertions such as "he saved many Jews in Rome from persecution and ultimately death" or "Every day, Pfeiffer visited the Regina Coeli prison and another prison on Via Tasso, where he would often return with freed prisoners who had been sentenced to death." (t · c) buidhe 08:27, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: would you still object if the article instead relied on the sources found by Bermicourt? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 04:58, 5 November 2021 (UTC) Depends, the Samerski source looks reliable to me but the book published by "Österreichische Provinz der Salvatorianer" has the same issue of close connection to the article subject. (t · c) buidhe 06:27, 5 November 2021 (UTC) All right. @Ergo Sum: I'm not going to promote the nomination without consensus to move forward, so if you want to try and rework the article's sourcing to approval, that can work.

This slipped my mind completely this weekend. I will deal with this tonight. Ergo Sum 15:45, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I have added several inline citations to the article, which refer to sources that were (very helpfully) added by Bermicourt. These sources support several of the very specific claims in the article, as well as the general thrust of the article which is in dispute here, namely that Pfeiffer was a liaison and in that capacity saved many Jews and others from the Nazis. In light of these reliable sources supporting the general claims, I think any concern about the pre-existing ones describing some of his more specific actions is ameliorated. There is a trove of additional sources in the Further Reading section that additionally describe in much greater detail Pfeiffer's actions but they are either in a foreign language which I do not adequately read to make use of as citations or are offline. All being said, I think there is now ample sourcing to back up the article's claims. Ergo Sum 05:49, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks, Ergo Sum—@Buidhe:, if this sourcing is up to your standards, we can move ahead. If not, we're probably going back to WT:DYK and asking for more eyes. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 05:52, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Hi, I've flagged the specific content in the article that supports the hook as needing a better source. There are other active cleanup tags on the article as well. However, I think there's sufficient sourcing for a modified version of the hook without the words "hundreds of".

Bermicourt (talk) 08:33, 17 November 2021 (UTC) According to the source it's what Vatican Radio said about him after his death. DYK is not for eulogies imo. (t · c) buidhe 08:37, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I'm not following—is the source unreliable because it's after his death? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 08:40, 17 November 2021 (UTC) No, it's because it's Catholic presumably... We could always add "according to Vatican Radio..." But better still, we just need to cite the exact text from one of the many non-Catholic book sources and the problem will be solved. Bermicourt (talk) 08:46, 17 November 2021 (UTC) And yet another source: O'Reilly (2001) in Forgotten Battles: Italy's War of Liberation 1943-45 states that "the Vatican was able to assist many of Rome's Jews and others sought by the Germans through Father Pancrazio Pfeiffer's intervention with the Germans... His work was recounted by Robert Graham who has written extensively on the Vatican's role in World War II." Bermicourt (talk) 09:01, 17 November 2021 (UTC) And another: Bartley (2016) in Catholics Confronting Hitler states that "Father Pancrace [sic] Pfeiffer, a German priest and the superior general of the Salvatorian Order, was the pope's liaison with the German military. Several hundred hostages, including some under sentence of death, owed their release to the efficacious intervention of Father Pfeiffer." I don't know why I'm doing this - you can look up the references yourselves instead of opining and speculating from the sidelines in the classic Wikipedia way. :) Bermicourt (talk) 09:08, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @Bermicourt: Since it seems you have access to several sources that I do not (probably just requires further digging), would you want to add them as inline citations with page numbers, especially to support the proposition regarding hundreds of people saved?

I'd be in favor instead of the hook being split into two separate proposals: one hook about the fact that she was an internet celebrity who grew up in a place without tap water, and a separate hook about her going viral for making hamburgers. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:23, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Full review needed, which can also address the issue of the borderline ALT1 hook. BlueMoonset (talk) 04:23, 5 November 2021 (UTC) As far as I can tell the article meets DYK requirements, and a QPQ has been done. Earwigs finds a close match with Coda Media, but that's only because it was the source for quotes in the article, and all of them are properly referenced. I find the first hook hard to believe given China's international standing, and in any case as brought up by Bowlhover may be inaccurate anyway. As for the second hook, as I mentioned before it's ineligible as it's exactly 200 characters long, and per WP:DYK hooks that are at or shorter than 200 characters may be rejected per reviewer's discretion. Both ALT0 and ALT1 have struck: I am repeating my earlier suggestion that ALT1 instead be split into two separate hooks. As this is a China-related article and there appear to be some political discussion in the article, I'd also like to ask for a second opinion from someone more knowledgeable about China-related articles if the article doesn't fall afoul of relevant guidelines. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 13:12, 6 November 2021 (UTC) From Wikipedia:Did you know#The hook: The hook should be concise: no more than about 200 characters (including spaces and the question mark, but not including the ..., the space immediately following the ..., or any (pictured)). While 200 is a hard limit, hooks near or at this limit may still be rejected at the discretion of reviewers and administrators. This tool can be used for counting words. The guideline says that "200 is a hard limit", so it is not true that the 200-character ALT1 hook is "ineligible" or "simply too long". No reason has been given for rejecting a 200-character hook "at the discretion of reviewers". Here are two additional hooks based on the suggestion: ALT2: ... that Dianxi Xiaoge, who grew up in a remote Yunnan mountain without running water, is an Internet celebrity with roughly 16 million subscribers on all her platforms? ALT3: ... Dianxi Xiaoge went viral in China and internationally after making hamburgers for her grandparents who had never eaten them before? Cunard (talk) 07:48, 7 November 2021 (UTC) Well for one thing, the original was very difficult to read and seemed to combine too many facts into one hook. Usually DYK prefers simpler hooks whenever possible. In any case, I think ALT3 is the best hook here and the nomination is otherwise good to go, I'd just like to hear a second opinion from another editor on the article tone given that I'm a bit uncomfortable doing a solo review here given the "Commentary" section delves into some political matters. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:36, 7 November 2021 (UTC) On second thought, I have some concerns regarding the length of the article. Isn't it rather detailed for an internet celebrity's page? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 11:10, 7 November 2021 (UTC) That the article is "rather detailed for an internet celebrity's page" should not be a concern. The sources provided substantial analysis of her and her work, and this article reflects those sources. Other detailed articles for Internet celebrities include PewDiePie and MrBeast. Cunard (talk) 11:18, 7 November 2021 (UTC) Pinging Gatoclass for his input, as he responded to a discussion I raised about this nomination over at WT:DYK. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:57, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I don't think we need Gatoclass to restate themself. Here's what they said at WT:DYK: The article doesn't use the phrase "one of only three Chinese influencers to gain international influence", so I'm not sure where you got that, but it does say she is one of only three "Chinese Internet celebrities who have reached international prominence", and the problem with that claim is that it's sourced to an article that is two years old and therefore not up-to-date. With regard to the overall length, I would agree that it is overly detailed and could use a trim. I'm not sure this is relevant to DYK however, as "overly detailed" is not one of our criteria. What I would say is that the level of detail does raise the chances of close paraphrasing so the article would need to be carefully checked for that. Anybody else with an opinion on this article?

Thriley (talk) 20:57, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @Thriley: I'll ping BlueMoonset here in case I'm wrong, but I'm going to say no, it isn't. My reasoning here is that if the hook were read as plaintext, without any bolding or linking, it would be read as pretty much only interesting as it concerns the plot. The hook should concern Smit's life; if it concerns her work as an actress, only stating her role and not anything about production doesn't make the hook out-of-universe. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 21:28, 17 November 2021 (UTC) theleekycauldron, I was taking a look at the ALT1 hook and its sources, and the second Biography sentence is basically copied from Esquire—the Google translate version, at any rate. That's a problem. Another problem is that the source doesn't actually say that she was working as a hotel receptionist when she got the call, just that it was "one of these jobs", referring back to the four in the previous sentence, none of which were hotel receptionist. The article also needs a bit of copyediting. I don't think that either of the plot-based hooks should be used, and as Drmies notes, "first film" is not accurate, since it's Cross the Line that's in the source, which appears to be her fifth film. We could only use "first feature film" if the previous four in her filmography were all short films (which would need to be clearly sourced). Perhaps an angle for the information in ALT1 would be to say she was working in whatever job it was when she was cast in Cross the Line, for which she was nominated as best new actress in the Goya Awards. BlueMoonset (talk) 02:31, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Here’s an article that states she was working as a receptionist two years before she was hired to work on Parallel Mothers:[6] Does it appear reliable? Thriley (talk) 05:38, 20 November 2021 (UTC) I don't see a reason to doubt the source. However, it isn't sufficient to support the "when she was called" hook claim, just that she was a hotel receptionist two years before the article was written (and possibly two years and a number of months, since you can't assume it's exactly two years). BlueMoonset (talk) 17:14, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Perhaps the hook should include all her various jobs before her Almodovar role? Thriley (talk) 01:47, 23 November 2021 (UTC) ALT3 “before starring in the Pedro Almodóvar film Parallel Mothers, Milena Smit worked as a model, waitress, shop assistant, babysitter, teleoperator, subway information assistant, and hotel receptionist?” El País Thriley (talk) 01:51, 23 November 2021 (UTC) That hook is 197 characters which puts it in discretionary territory.

I do like the hooks and it's an intriguing subject for an article! I wanted to flag the following comments, in case they are helpful (please ignore if not!): I don't quite follow this sentence in the lead: "Moreover, it is still pointed out that the emendation Albruna agrees with the names of other Germanic wise women." Should "instriptions" (before the Drusus heading) be "inscriptions"? Should the names of scholars be wikilinked, where there is a page for the author (e.g. Simek)? What does mss mean, and could this be explained when it is first referenced? The second paragraph of the Aurinia section has two sentences starting with "However" in a row, which is a bit awkward to read.

To be expected, since they're cited almost 20 times each, and since the vast majority of the matches concern long quotes I'm willing to overlook it, but can we add more citations throughout the paragraphs? Particularly with "Conflict with Miles and Reynolds", there's four citations crammed at the end of the section. I think we should cite each after the corresponding sentences, especially where there's a direct quotation.

Its long enough and new and lots of good refs - including the hook fact. It documents a notable woman from the 14th century and there were not many of those.

Nice addition. well done Victuallers (talk) 10:31, 6 November 2021 (UTC) Reopening this because I think the hook is misleading, as according to the source it was usual for women of the nobility, like Neville, to sign with their own names.

We don't need to say it's unusual if we phrase it that way theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 02:14, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Theleekycauldron, the problem with both hooks is that they imply that there was something out-of-the-ordinary in a woman signing something in her own name in that era, whereas the source indicates that was normal practice for women of the nobility. So the hooks are misleading. Gatoclass (talk) 02:19, 19 November 2021 (UTC) All right—I'll ping @Lajmmoore and Victuallers: back here, y'all can work this out. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 02:33, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Was it usual for women in the fourteenth century to sign with their own name ... no. Is is usual for women in the 21st century to sign with just their first name? No. So "did you know that unusually Canada's head of state signs documents with just her first name and an R for Regina?" (Someone shouts) "BUT all British Queens do that!!" (Someone shouts) "That implies that it was unusual for Queens to sign with just their first name." No it doesnt. I think @Gatoclass: is reading the source and then saying that the hook doesnt explain every piece of information in the source... which obviously it doesnt. Its unusual that "a woman" is doing this at all. It WAS unusual for women in the fourteenth century to sign and if they did then they did not usually use just their own name. Its a fact - its unusual. Did You know that women did not sign their own names on documents in the 14th century? No I didnt. That is something that Lajmmoore wrote about and now I know. Thanks. Victuallers (talk) 08:28, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Hello Gatoclass all so the part of the source I was using is this, which is talking about signatures for charitable donation "Although most of the widows declare themselves to be the wife of their late husband, or their father's daughter, others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names, such as 'domina Margareta de Longvl' and 'don-ýina Margareta de Nevill' (the same person). The majority of widows declare that their marital status and their power to act, using a variety of phrases, including 'in pura viduitate', 'in pura viduitate mea et ligia potestate', and 'in viduitate mea propria et potestate legitima' ..." and I read that as it was more usual for (noble) women to use a signature that described them as "wife of, etc..." I read the passage as Legg using Margaret de Neville as an unusual example. Legg is talking about the Coucher Book signatures specifically, but I still think they are marking out unusual practice. In terms of the hook, I wonder whether changing 'woman' to 'literate woman' might work? Lajmmoore (talk) 09:32, 19 November 2021 (UTC) No, it wouldn't work just to add "literate". And your reading of the text just amounts to an unsupported assumption on your part. Because while the text could admittedly be less ambiguous, the statement that others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names does not in any way suggest that it was rare or unusual for a member of the nobility to give their name, it only states that members of the nobility as a class were inclined to give their names. So there isn't sufficient support in that statement for a hook which implies that Neville's act was in any way unusual for a member of her class. The hook makes Neville sound like some sort of proto-feminist who boldly challenged the system, when the underlying source only indicates that either her entire class did the same thing, or at least that it was an accepted practice for members of the nobility. So I still think that either the hook needs to be substantially reworked to more closely reflect the source, or a new hook be found. Gatoclass (talk) 02:53, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks for sharing your interpretation of your text Gatoclass. My interpretation (& so the hook) is based on Legg's use of the word most - in that "most of the widows declare themselves to be the wife of their late husband, or their father's daughter" and you rightly point out "others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names" but I think that needs to be balanced by the "most" earlier in the sentence i.e. for women generally, they don't give their name, but some noble women do but overall, for women signing their name, it is unusual enough to be pointed out in the text.

Whispyhistory (talk) 04:04, 13 November 2021 (UTC) @Whispyhistory: But that would be impossible, the article can't possibly mention IP addresses, it's about broken toes.

It's okay with me if allowed (dyk says hook needs to be in article and in the following ref). Whispyhistory (talk) 06:32, 13 November 2021 (UTC) I don't see that exact sequence of numbers in the source, although there are others that look a bit like an IP address. The trouble is, the nominator seems to be the source for it looking a bit like an IP address, which it does, but we can't use that unless the source makes a similar point, which it does not appear to do. Something like this might work (numbers might need to be changed as mentioned): ALT1 ... that a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone may be described as 88.5.3.2? Philafrenzy (talk) 10:16, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Regarding the image, it's a fun idea but I don't think we run images as quizzes and the image is simply a skeletal foot, and not closely enough related to the hook.

I don't see how the hook you're suggesting is hooky. What exactly is wrong with the hook proposed? It's in the article and it's supported by the sources cited. And the image is directly related to the hook. It engages the reader into a spotting game. Dr. Vogel (talk) 14:57, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Like everyone else, I rather like the IP-address hook. If we wikilinked IP address, it would be supported in the linked articles, and fulfill the requirement that anyone following the links will be able to verify the hook. I don't think we need sourcing that says that a specific sequence of numbers is an IP address, as we have sources giving the general format of an IP address, and creating an example would be a trivial calculation ("Are all four of these numbers separated by periods in the range 0-255?"): "IPv4 and IPv6 address formats". www.ibm.com. An IPv4 address has the following format: x . x . x . x where x is called an octet and must be a decimal value between 0 and 255. Octets are separated by periods. An IPv4 address must contain three periods and four octets. The following examples are valid IPv4 addresses: 1 . 2 . 3 . 4 01 . 102 . 103 . 104 This hook is better than any alternative I can think of, and I don't see anything likely to be problematic about it (it's certainly verifiable). I think we might be in agreement on that? So if some rule technically prohibits it, we might have a good case for applying the WP:Ignore all the rules policy. Broken finger is also currently DYK-eligible and I think it uses the same numbering scheme.[1] HLHJ (talk) 02:07, 14 November 2021 (UTC) [edit: add fulltext url] I don't necessarily agree with the reading of WP:DYKCRIT 3b ( Each fact in the hook must be supported in the article by at least one inline citation to a reliable source [...]) that says that the IP thing needs to be in the article (compare e.g. Template:Did you know nominations/Urine deflector, which similarly took some creative licence in how the proposed hooks were phrased beyond what was stated in either the article or the cited source), and I agree with HLHJ that WP:IAR would be applicable regardless. As for the hooks themselves, writing "a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone may be described as 88.5.3.2" is a much poorer way of writing the hook (less "hooky") than the converse, i.e. "88.5.3.2 may refer to a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone". TompaDompa (talk) 11:28, 14 November 2021 (UTC) This. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 17:01, 16 November 2021 (UTC) We can't use IP address because the nominator just thought it up "oh, that looks like an IP address". It's not in the source as the nominator admits and therefore is not verifiable. And so what if it does look like an IP address? What does that tell us about broken toes? I like clever or quirky hooks and have written many (if I may say so), but they have to be based on something in the sources otherwise it's things made up one day. Philafrenzy (talk) 10:19, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you for all your comments. This is not the place to ignore all rules. The proposed hook is not supported by the source given in the article. I am inclined to approve ALT1 but it needs checking, unless another hook is proposed. Whispyhistory (talk) 15:11, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Oh dear, this has become contentious. I think the contended question is whether it's acceptable to have verified information not found in the nominated article, but only in another article, linked in the hook. Not as hooky, but for illustration: ALT3 ... that the dot-decimal notation string "88.5.3.2" is not only an an IPv4 address, but also a fracture in the middle of the bone at the tip of the little toe? "IPv4 and IPv6 address formats". www.ibm.com., Hallux proximal phalanx fracture in adults: an overlooked diagnosis I don't think we're debating whether the IP-address-hook statement is verifiable. The statement that "88.5.3.2" (and any number in that format) is a valid IPv4 address is supported by the IP address article and the IPv4 article, and this format is the subject of the Dot-decimal notation article. No-one had bothered to cite those statements in those articles, but since they've been challenged here, I've now cited them. So "88.5.3.2 is both an IP address[1] and a code for a broken toebone[2]" is certainly verifiable, and is now verified on Wikipedia. Any DYK reader should have no trouble verifying that the hook is accurate. Alternatives that do not mention IP addressees are not as hooky, but don't contain more information about broken toes: ALT4 ... that "88.5.3.2" is a toe fracture in the middle of the bone at the tip of the little toe, while a "78.5.3.2" is the parallel broken finger?

Philafrenzy (talk) 19:25, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you Philafrenzy ( a very experienced DYK contributor) for your efforts in helping new editors understand DYK. Your comment higher up about "88.5.3.2" and "ip address" not being in the source is true and I am grateful for your suggested alts. Essentially, the initial and subsequent hooks sound good, but none are in the article or the source. I don't wish for personal comments and don't mind if someone else wishes to take over here. With due respect @DrVogel: and @HLHJ:...You may wish to take this up at Wikipedia talk:Did you know. Whispyhistory (talk) 10:41, 15 November 2021 (UTC) I won't say I wish I hadn't written the article; I hope it's useful enough to make up for the social harm to the project here. I don't think the hostility was intended by anyone; I suspect that it's felt partly due to the ease of mininterpretation in a text-only medium and partly due to human cognitive biases.[2] I certainly did, and do, not intend it. I spent a day's editing trying to resolve the conflict by finding references specifically saying that the two things were in notation X and adding that text to the article, but unfortunately non-inductive descriptions of the notations seem to have been considered so needless that an Internet RFC attempting to formalize them died of disinterest. I did find a source that explicitly defines the IPv4 format, and one that explicitly says that 88.1.2.2 is a specific fracture, and I've cited the latter in the article, but I don't think this helps. It is probably a bit unreasonable to expect a reviewer to do more than apply rules as best they can, and Wikipedia talk:Did you know might indeed be a better forum for a more detailed discussion. I don't really want to take part in one, though (nothing to do with this discussion, prior reasons). I posted because I felt responsible for the conflict and thought I might be able to help. My impression is that I made it worse; my apologies to everyone I've offended. HLHJ (talk) 03:41, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Nobody is offended, but if I may say so I think you are still missing the point. IP addresses have nothing to do with broken toes even if that notation may have a similarity. That's why the sources don't make the comparison and why the IP-based hooks are no good. Any of the other hooks might be fine (I haven't checked the numbers) just without the bit about IP addresses. The whole thing reminds me of unusually shaped vegetables where you may see a carrot shaped like a foot, people who see faces in clouds, and even apophenia. My personal observation that one thing looks a bit like another is not the basis for a hook unless reliable sources make the point too. Philafrenzy (talk) 09:09, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Folks, we are wasting a wonderful hook. Really. IP addresses have nothing to do with broken toes even if that notation may have a similarity and that is the whole point of making good hooks. They are supposed to be short, punchy, catchy, and likely to draw the readers in to wanting to read the article – as long as they don't misstate the article content. And one of the best recipes to make a hook good is to make it sound counterintuitive With any other option but the original, we are bound to receive another hook frequented by maybe a few hundred visitors. I would propose something to the tune of in some contexts, 88.5.3.2 might not mean an IP address but a broken bone in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone? so that no one claims here that we somehow delegitimise the IP address but at the same time so that we preserve the core of the hook. As for the claims that because the hook is not cited in the IP part, it can't be there - please don't be that pedantic. In our today's world of informatics we may assume that people who visit Wikipedia more or less imagine what IP addresses are, and may more or less imagine how they look like (in the worst case they will visit the article for details). The other part is cited. I see no problem with the original. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 17:01, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Szmenderowiecki I admit that I'm not very familiar with the topic, and the above discussion was confusing, but is the "this isn't an IP address" claim actually in the source? Because if it's not, then no matter how good the hook proposal is, it can't be used in a hook since hook facts need to be based on a reference. Also, I'm pretty sure that assumptions don't count as sources. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:31, 17 November 2021 (UTC) What I was leading is that we don't need to cite that the sky is blue, or that we have five fingers; or that there exist IP addresses for that matter.

We're allowed to. This is not a massive occasion where we can save the whole project by breaking the rules. Its a trivial example of what some (not all) think may be a breach in the rules, with a small, but amusing, advantage. So I'm not asking the defenders of the rules to admit that this is not a breech ... I am suggesting that they might just concede that the harm done by allowing this hook might not offend anyone ... and it might please a few thousand. Victuallers (talk) 15:28, 20 November 2021 (UTC) We don't need to break the rules. The observation that the notation looks a bit like an IP address is trivial and completely unrelated to broken toes. There are already perfectly good hooks above that work better. Nobody is saying don't use the numbers, just strike the bit about IP addresses. The originally proposed hook is not the work of comic genius and cleverness that some seem to think it is. Philafrenzy (talk) 21:58, 20 November 2021 (UTC) The main issue here is that it's one of the core rules of DYK that hook facts must be mentioned in the article, ideally explicitly or at least implied by supporting information. The thing is that at the moment, IP addresses are not mentioned anywhere in the article, so the hooks using the IP address angle would be ineligible according to that criterion anyway. Even April Fools hooks, which tend to be misleading, are still generally based on hook facts that are mentioned in the respective articles. So if we can't even grant IAR exemptions for that criterion for AFD hooks, the one day of the year where our hooks tend to follow the rules most loosely, I can't see why such a request should be granted here.

Nominated by Victuallers (talk) at 16:21, 6 November 2021 (UTC). Article is new enough. Two correct writers are credited. The article is fully referenced. No copyvio detected. There is a bit of biased POV pushing in Wikipedia voice: "most vulnerable to climate change". This will be something our subject is saying no doubt. And this idea is also reflected in the hook with "endangered". The hook content is referenced and confirmed by the Guardian, apart from the "endangered" bit, which opinion is attributed to Tina Stege. So I suggest that "endangered" is taken out of the hook, or it is reworded so it is clear she is saying that. Hook alt1 is unsuitable as it does not link the article and I cannot tell what it is trying to say in relation to the subject. I can confirm image is CC-BY-3.0 as derived from the video with CC-BY-3.0 license. However I would suggest that a different image is selected from the video, perhaps near the end where the microphone is not obscuring her chin. QPQ is done. Graeme Bartlett (talk) 06:03, 15 November 2021 (UTC) @Graeme Bartlett: Thanks for the review Graeme - I have recut a new image. Surprised that "endangered" wasn't referenced. I'm not sure it is just her opinion -"Projected sea level rise would mean 40% of the buildings in the Marshall Islands’ capital of Majuro would be permanently flooded and entire islands would disappear, potentially costing the Pacific country its status as a nation, according to a devastating new report from the World Bank." is a quote from the reference I have added to balance the idea that "endangered" might by pov.

Graeme Bartlett (talk) 20:56, 22 November 2021 (UTC) @Graeme Bartlett: Are you suggesting that we imply that "endangered" is her opinion despite the fact that she represents a nation and the "endangered" aspect is supported by the World Bank and the Guardian newspaper (and the 1bn people estimated to be part of the "High Ambition" group ) saying so? Is there any evidence that is just her opinion and not that of her country and the World Bank? Am I missing something? It you feel you need to give this "a cross" then can I suggest that we ask for a new reviewer?I have suggested an alt that does not use the endangered word.

Self-nominated at 23:51, 4 November 2021 (UTC). @DferDaisy: This article is about 3300 bytes, and was nominated for DYK shortly after creation, satisfying date and length criteria. There is a factual error, as the article states she was interred in Keokuk, Illinois, but the source says she died in Chicago, Illinois and was interred in Keokuk, Iowa. I am assuming good faith for a few references I cannot access (for example, ref 15 - The National Humane Review), which for me gives a landing page for the document, instead of an inside view). Otherwise, everything is properly sourced and there are no copyvio or close paraphrasing concerns (Earwig cites 3 potential problems, but they are not an issue here.) QPQ not required. Regarding the hooks, ALT0 is incorrect as stated, as it reads as if the study was conducted in the early 1900s by Meigs Crowder, whereas she published it in 1917 based on studies from that period. It'll need minor alteration. ALT1 is fine and sourced. I would prefer to promote an amended ALT0. A minor quibble, though not an issue for DYK: please add page numbers for cited sources. If online access is eliminated from the sources, it'll force anyone investigating those sources to wade through too many pages to find the desired detail.

AleatoryPonderings (???) (!!!) 01:52, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @AleatoryPonderings: Yes, but note that this court case is the "leading case with respect to the issue of common employers", establishing a precedent in Canadian law. At the time the lawsuit was filed, this was not the case, and in fact the trial judge ruled against Alouche (see last paragraph of background section); it was only after the case was brought to the Court of Appeal for Ontario that the "common employer doctrine" was established, and it became entrenched when leave to appeal the decision at the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed. Mindmatrix 15:11, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Ah, so the idea behind the hook is that, since Downtown Eatery changed the law on common employers, before Downtown Eatery Best Beaver would not have been Alouche's employer? That makes more sense. AleatoryPonderings (???) (!!!) 15:20, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: I'm going to inspect this again... Mindmatrix 15:18, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @AleatoryPonderings: Alright, so to ensure everything is correct, the following timeline occurred: Alouche was hired to be manager at For Your Eyes Only (owned by Grad and Grosman), and began work on 29 December 1992 Alouche was sent a Notice of Discipline in May 1993, and was fired on 15 June 1993 In October 1993, Alouche filed action for wrongful dismissal against Best Beaver Management Inc., as that was the source of his paycheques Best Beaver ceased operations in mid-1996, and all assets distributed to other companies owned by Grad and Grosman The trial resolved in favour of Alouche Best Beaver did not pay out the judgement (all its assets had been redistributed) Sherriffs were dispatched to For Your Eyes Only, where they seized $1,855 Downtown Eatery filed claim against Alouche, stating the cash belonged to it Alouche defended, and counterclaimed against Grad, Grosman, and all companies they controlled on the grounds of common employer doctrine, the oppression remedy of the Ontario Business Corporations Act, and fraudulent conveyance the judge in the second trial (at Ontario Superior Court of Justice) ruled against Alouche the case was brought to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, where the previous ruling was overturned in 2001 in January 2002, an application for leave to appeal the decision at the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed So, the common employer doctrine was part of the second trial as a counterclaim to the suit filed by Downtown Eatery. I just wanted to ensure this satisfies your concerns. Mindmatrix 18:25, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks for this incredibly thorough response. My concern is maybe philosophical or definitional. If I say that company A employs person B, that has an ordinary meaning and a legal meaning. It is probably right that Best Beaver did not employ Alouche in the ordinary sense of "employ", because Best Beaver was a "paymaster" and not the name on the front of the building where he went to work. My reading of the case itself is that, before Downtown Eatery, it was at best indeterminate as a legal matter whether Best Beaver, alone or in combination with its affiliate companies, employed Alouche. After Downtown Eatery, it was established—as a matter of legal meaning, but not necessarily ordinary meaning—that Best Beaver was his employer, or part of his employer, or something like that. The reason I brought this up is that it's not clear how one could verify the claim that "Best Beaver was not Alouche's employer", because that claim might be true as a matter of ordinary meaning but the only authoritative legal ruling we have on this (namely, Downtown Eatery) holds that the claim is false. In any event, I'll leave this to the eventual reviewer to sort out. I find my brain twisting into knots. AleatoryPonderings (???)

Interesting: N - see below Other problems: N - see below QPQ: None required. Overall: Hello, Mungo and welcome to DYK! Review as follows: The article is new enough, long enough and neutral. However, it includes a WP:IMDB source and I am unsure about the reliability of several other sources, including Film Ink, Queer Media Matters, Antaeus.org, Fern TV, Addicted to Horror Movies, Dan's Papers, Go Mag, Three Women in a Box and North Coast Rep. To add to that, the YouTube link does not appear to be uploaded by an official channel, making it unreliable. Additionally, per MOS:FILMCAST uncredited roles need a source. the copyvio checker showed up a 50%+ similarity with a source, which may suggest over quotation. On top of that, the subject has unclear notability. I'm unsure which roles are significant and The House on Pine Street appears to have a questionable notability. None of her awards seem significant and I'm not seeing any significant coverage from reliable, independent sources. ALT0 isn't very interesting given the festival is not significant enough to have an article. I think ALT1 is interesting but it seems to focus more on the character, not the actress which isn't exactly ideal... QPQ not needed. We'll need some work but we'll get there!

Thanks, DanCherek. while the article is over 1,500 prose characters, I'm going to be a stickler and say that this is still a stub.

Moving on, the article was created from a redir and nominated in time and is neutral, although I'm requesting a second opinion on the sourcing. The article seems to be plagiarism free, and a QPQ has been done. As for the hook, I'm not sure it quite checks out—is the church expected to break away? Because the article just says that a vote is planned and expected. Once we clear those two up, we're good to go. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 02:41, 21 November 2021 (UTC) @Theleekycauldron: Not entirely sure what the concern on the sourcing is; there are multiple reputable sources. Also, the lede is fairly clear that this is a planned schism, as the hook says. While I appreciate the review, I am dissatisfied with your effort.

Thanks! ~ Pbritti (talk) 05:10, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Isn't there a difference between "planned" (alt1) and "expected" (alt0)? planned implies it may or may not happen, expected is like forecasting—at least, that's how i read it. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 05:19, 21 November 2021 (UTC) @Theleekycauldron: Merriam-Webster considers them definitionally synonymous terms (see definition 2).

Maximilian Dood ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that in August 2021, YouTuber Maximilian Dood's viral social media campaign for Marvel vs. Capcom 2's rerelease caught the regards of studio Digital Eclipse, who expressed interest in rereleasing the game? Source: 1 and 2 Comment: This is the first time I’ve ever made a DYK here, so here goes. I personally find this fact interesting because it highlights how the advent of YouTube, and internet fame in general, has allowed people to use their voice to reach people in positions of high influence, bringing hidden ideas to light and advocating for change. While this specific example falls under a video game/pop-culture category, and may not fit Wikipedia’s desire for academic material, I feel that this is interesting enough to share, as it’s one the gaming community can relate to, like with other social media trends such as #FreeSmash and "Rerelease Mother 3." As for the article itself, all of the citations should be reliable enough; they’re all from third-party/secondary source outlets and there isn’t any BLP violation to be found here. One concern I have is criteria #3 - “Each fact in the hook must be supported in the article by at least one inline citation to a reliable source, appearing no later than the end of the sentence(s) offering that fact. Citations at the end of the paragraph are not sufficient.” While the hook is sourced in the article, the refs are at the end of the section rather than per each sentence. I can fix that however. Anyway, I hope this fact does get accepted! If not, I understand, thanks for reviewing this anyway. Created/expanded by PantheonRadiance (talk). Self-nominated at 08:45, 17 November 2021 (UTC).

Article is new enough, very newsworthy event and hence well-sourced, no copyvios (Earwig reports a false positive on the Johnson quotation), QPQ done.

Newness requirement satisfied by 5x expansion on 11/15 from < 600 to > 3000 characters. Articles also long enough and compliant with core policies on citations and neutrality. The hook is in-line sourced. Photo has appropriate license. QPQ is done. There are, however, two problems: (1) There is some significant overlap with this source. To start, the following sentence is taken from the source without use of quotation marks and with no effort to paraphrase rather than use the precise words: "Local advocacy led to the establishment of Bridle Trails as a state park in 1932." Further, this sentence also strikes me as too closely drawn from the same source: "Initial park development dates to 1933 when Civil Works Administration employees and federal relief workers were employed in state parks as part of the New Deal program. Further work included burning logging debris, clearing brush and building trails and fences." Work needs to be done to put the material into your own words. (2) The hook strikes me as boring in that it states an obvious point. Horses having the right of way on this trail is not unique or special. On trails that are shared by humans and horses, it is the general rule that horses have the right of way. See here ("In general, horses always have the right of way, followed by hikers, then by bikers."). See also here ("For safety reasons, if you come across a horse and rider on any trail they always have right of way. Hikers and bike riders all yield to horses.")

For one, the quote is not actually "could have been made by aliens" so, considering this is all about misquotation, we should either use the actual quote or clarify that it is a misquotation.

Graham87 09:41, 18 November 2021 (UTC) @Gerda Arendt: Thank you for the review. Diamonds were often cut in cabochon style in the 19th century and earlier. This one was cut with a flat bottom like all cabochons, and when viewed from above, it was a large oval, about 1.5 inches long. Modern cabochons usually have a smoothly rounded surface; this one was lightly faceted but the facets don't show on the sculpture. So it looks like half an egg, I suppose. The Koh-i-Noor is the large oval at the bottom of the picture. We have no specific citation for artistic licence - that is just a conclusion that we can probably make, since we have no evidence that Victoria ever had it set in a necklace. Therefore I cannot use "artistic licence" in a hook or in the article. I'll have a go at a hook using a full-length Victoria, and another hook using the Warrior and Wounded Youth sculpture. I'll come back shortly with those.

As for the hooks, I'm going to reject ALT0 out of hand, because Ben Comeau can take a number on that one. I'm also going to say no to ALT1, not because it's uncivil or uninteresting, but because it should be quoted—I've suggested two minor alts. A QPQ is also needed.

I've been trying to come up with something catchy on this -- for example, had Comeau invited Trump to participate in a performance of the work, then we could say he told Trump to fugue himself -- but the sourcing just isn't there that I can see. In consolation, here's an enlightening bit of musical history you will want to share with friends and family: Q: Why did Bach have so many children?

EEng 16:47, 17 November 2021 (UTC) The video for "Boris Johnson is a Lying Shit" includes a description from Comeau that basically screams for people not to vote for him, and the one for "Donald Trump is a Wanker" says "As satisfying as it is to poke fun at the Orange Monster, this video on its own probably won’t do the teeniest thing to reduce the devastation inflicted by the Trump administration. I therefore want to use this platform to suggest ways we can contribute to meaningful anti-Trump resistance.". We'd need to flesh out the article with these WP:BLPPRIMARY sources for the "thinks" to be properly verifiable.

Did you know that a recently discovered 1692 libretto of an actual Abendmusik bears similarities to Wacht! Euch zum Streit?[1][2]. Or that the Abendmusiken were actually presented right after Vespers?[3] Vespers, which themselves lasted two or three hours, in addition to a further three or four hour Hauptgottesdienst in the morning?[4][5] That might be one of the reasons why the audience was reported to be so disorderly, to the point that the town watch had to be hired to maintain a semblance of order.[6] That, and a lot more, which would surely allow to take this to DYK at a later time, after having greatly expanded this. Or at least, it's my opinion that taking the sole opportunity for DYK now would be a waste when it can be done when the article is expanded and made into something significantly more attractive and informative.

Fact is, I have the score and the whole text (including in translation) with me, in addition to lots of critical commentary on the piece itself (too much of which is focused on the question of authenticity, but alas...) and on the Abendmusiken in general. This can be used to make a proper article, but it would require time, which at the moment I really need to put into meeting an actual deadline than here. I've given you a list of pertinent sources (many of which are in German, if that's easier for you), if you're interested you know where to ask. On top of all of that, there's the question of article title (should it be at the current one or at Wacht! Euch zum Streit gefasset macht (a title which is used in a fair amount of sources, too...) Cheers, RandomCanadian (talk / contribs) 00:01, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Short version of what I replied on my talk: The time for it is in Advent. This year or next, that is the question. I'm also busy with other things, and both your familiarity with the topic, and your better English, make me wish you did it. For DYK, just raising attention is the goal. If you want it GA, we probably better wait. You decide. --Gerda Arendt (talk) 07:50, 22 November 2021 (UTC) The title: Wikipedia goes by the common title, and the other (and probably more) should be redirects.

Overall: Article meets eligibility criteria. i.e newness and article length. Article is well sourced and is neutral in tone. Hook is interesting and is cited. Copyvio scores ~20% in major part due to a quote that has been attributed rightly. However, the nominator might want to consider removing the quote and rewriting the sentence because the original Nepal Times article does not have it as a quote and is likely a paraphrasing done by the newspaper to begin with. Hence, we should not include it as a quote. In addition, I would encourage the nominator to consider expanding the article - to be clear, the article is good to go as-is. But looking at Hanuman Dhoka for instance there is an opportunity to build this article more than just a "History" section. Handing it back to the nominator. Some work and this is ready for homepage.

According to page 217 of "Account of the Late Granville Sharp...", Sharp approached Robert Kite, who is listed as lord mayor for only 1766. Can you reconcile those date discrepancies? (I do see that the Hochschild ref mentions the event as 2 years later from 1765, so there is some inconsistency in the reference material too.)

Further information: Official supplementary guidelines and unofficial guide  Warning: You are not logged in. Please create an account or log in to proceed. Alternatively, you may leave a message at the bottom of the DYK project talk page with the article you would like to nominate and the hook you would like to propose.  Warning: The helper script only works on desktop. Please switch to desktop view to continue. Install the DYK helper script by adding the line {{subst:lusc|User:SD0001/DYK-helper.js}} to your common.js page. Go back to the article, and choose the "DYK" option from the "More" menu (see image). Fill in the form and submit it. Check back periodically to address comments or concerns from the reviewer (it may take several weeks). Manual instructions[edit] Create a subpage for your new DYK suggestion and then list the page below under the date the article was created or the expansion began or it became a good article (not the date you submit it here), with the newest dates at the bottom. Any registered user may nominate a DYK suggestion (if you are not a registered user, please leave a message at the bottom of the DYK project talk page with the details of the article you would like to nominate and the hook you would like to propose); self-nominations are permitted and encouraged. Thanks for participating and please remember to check back for comments on your nomination (consider watchlisting your nomination page). Read these instructions completely before proceeding. For simplified instructions, see User:Rjanag/Quick DYK 2. I. Create the nomination subpage. Enter the article title in the box below and click the button. (To nominate multiple articles together, enter any or all of the article titles.) You will then be taken to a preloaded nomination page. II. Write the nomination. On the nomination page, fill in the relevant information. See Template:NewDYKnomination and {{NewDYKnomination/guide}} for further information. Not every line of the template needs to be filled in. For instance, if you are not nominating an image to appear with your hook, there is no need to fill in the image-related lines. Add an edit summary e.g. "Nominating YOUR ARTICLE TITLE for DYK" and click Publish page. Make sure the nomination page is on your watchlist, so you can follow the review discussion. III. Post at Template talk:Did you know. In the current nominations section find the subsection for the date on which the article was created or on which expansion began (or, if a new Good Article, the date on which it became a GA), not the date on which you make the nomination. At the top of that subsection (before other nominations already there, but below the section head and hidden comment) add {{Did you know nominations/YOUR ARTICLE TITLE}}. Add an edit summary e.g. "Nominating YOUR ARTICLE TITLE for DYK" and click Publish page. Frequently asked questions[edit] How do I write an interesting hook? Successful hooks tend to have several traits. Most importantly, they share a surprising or intriguing fact. They give readers enough context to understand the hook, but leave enough out to make them want to learn more. They are written for a general audience who has no prior knowledge of or interest in the topic area. Lastly, they are concise, and do not attempt to cover multiple facts or present information about the subject beyond what's needed to understand the hook. When will my nomination be reviewed? This page is often backlogged. As long as your submission is still on the page, it will stay there until an editor reviews it. Since editors are encouraged to review the oldest submissions first, it may take several weeks until your submission is reviewed. In the meantime, please consider reviewing another submission (not your own) to help reduce the backlog (see instructions below). Where is my hook? If you can't find the nomination you submitted to this nominations page, it may have been approved and is on the approved nominations page waiting to be promoted. It could also have been added to one of the prep areas, promoted from prep to a queue, or is on the main page. If the nominated hook is in none of those places, then the nomination has probably been rejected. Such a rejection usually only occurs if it was at least a couple of weeks old and had unresolved issues for which any discussion had gone stale. If you think your nomination was unfairly rejected, you can query this on the DYK discussion page, but as a general rule such nominations will only be restored in exceptional circumstances. Instructions for reviewers[edit] Main page: Wikipedia:Did you know/Reviewing guide Any editor who was not involved in writing/expanding or nominating an article may review it by checking to see that the article meets all the DYK criteria (long enough, new enough, no serious editorial or content issues) and the hook is cited. Editors may also alter the suggested hook to improve it, suggest new hooks, or even lend a hand and make edits to the article to which the hook applies so that the hook is supported and accurate. For a more detailed discussion of the DYK rules and review process see the supplementary guidelines and the WP:Did you know/Reviewing guide. To post a comment or review on a DYK nomination, follow the steps outlined below: Look through this page, Template talk:Did you know, to find a nomination you would like to comment on. Click the "Review or comment" link at the top of the nomination. You will be taken to the nomination subpage. The top of the page includes a list of the DYK criteria. Check the article to ensure it meets all the relevant criteria. To indicate the result of the review (i.e., whether the nomination passes, fails, or needs some minor changes), leave a signed comment on the page. Please begin with one of the 5 review symbols that appear at the top of the edit screen, and then indicate all aspects of the article that you have reviewed; your comment should look something like the following: Article length and age are fine, no copyvio or plagiarism concerns, reliable sources are used. But the hook needs to be shortened. If you are the first person to comment on the nomination, there will be a line :* <!-- REPLACE THIS LINE TO WRITE FIRST COMMENT, KEEPING  :* --> showing you where you should put the comment. Save the page. If there is any problem or concern about a nomination, please consider notifying the nominator by placing {{subst:DYKproblem|Article|header=yes|sig=yes}} on the nominator's talk page. Instructions for project members[edit] How to promote an accepted hook[edit] At-a-glance instructions on how to promote an approved hook to a Prep area See Wikipedia:Did you know/Preparation areas for details on verifying a hook's acceptability. Promoters should not promote their own nomination or their own review When promoting hooks intended for a particular date, keep in mind that when the number of available approved nominations exceeds 120 we switch to two sets per day, and when that number drops below 60 we return to one set per day. Check list for nomination review completeness 1) Select a hook from the approved nominations page that has one of these ticks at the bottom post: . 2) Check to make sure basic review requirements were completed. a. Any outstanding issue following needs to be addressed before promoting. 3) Check the article history for any substantive changes since it was nominated or reviewed. 4) Images for the lead slot must be freely licensed. Fair-use images are not permitted. Images loaded on Commons that appear on the Main Page are automatically protected by KrinkleBot. 5) Hook must be stated in both the article and source (which must be cited at the end of the article sentence where stated). 6) Hook should make sense grammatically. 7) Try to vary subject matters within each prep area. 8) Try to select a funny, quirky or otherwise upbeat hook for the last or bottom hook in the set. Steps to add a hook to prep In one tab, open the nomination page of the hook you want to promote. In a second tab, open the prep set you intend to add the hook to. 1) For hooks held for specific dates, refer to "Local update times" section on DYK Queue. a. Completed Prep area number sets will be promoted by an administrator to corresponding Queue number. 2) Copy and paste the hook into a chosen slot. a. Make sure there's a space between ... and that, and a ? at the end. b. Check that there's a bold link to the article. 3) If it's the lead (first) hook, paste the image where indicated at the top of the template. 4) Copy and paste ALL the credit information (the {{DYKmake}} and {{DYKnom}} templates) at the bottom 5) Check your work in the prep's Preview mode. a. At the bottom under "Credits", to the right of each article should have the link "View nom subpage" ; if not, a subpage parameter will need to be added to the DYKmake. 6) Save the Prep page. Closing the DYK nomination page At the upper left Change {{DYKsubpage to {{subst:DYKsubpage Change |passed= to |passed=yes At the bottom Just above the line containing }}<!--Please do not write below this line or remove this line. Place comments above this line.--> insert a new, separate line containing one of the following: To [[T:DYK/P1|Prep 1]] To [[T:DYK/P2|Prep 2]] To [[T:DYK/P3|Prep 3]] To [[T:DYK/P4|Prep 4]] To [[T:DYK/P5|Prep 5]] To [[T:DYK/P6|Prep 6]] To [[T:DYK/P7|Prep 7]] Also paste the same thing into the edit summary. Check in Preview mode. Make sure everything is against a pale blue background (nothing outside) and there are no stray characters, like }}, at the top or bottom. Save. For more information, please see T:TDYK#How to promote an accepted hook. Handy copy sources: To [[T:DYK/P1|Prep 1]] To [[T:DYK/P2|Prep 2]] To [[T:DYK/P3|Prep 3]] To [[T:DYK/P4|Prep 4]] To [[T:DYK/P5|Prep 5]] To [[T:DYK/P6|Prep 6]] To [[T:DYK/P7|Prep 7]] How to remove a rejected hook[edit] Open the DYK nomination subpage of the hook you would like to remove. (It's best to wait several days after a reviewer has rejected the hook, just in case someone contests or the article undergoes a large change.) In the window where the DYK nomination subpage is open, replace the line {{DYKsubpage with {{subst:DYKsubpage, and replace |passed= with |passed=no. Then save the page. This has the effect of wrapping up the discussion on the DYK nomination subpage in a blue archive box and stating that the nomination was unsuccessful, as well as adding the nomination to a category for archival purposes. How to remove a hook from the prep areas or queue[edit] Edit the prep area or queue where the hook is and remove the hook and the credits associated with it. Go to the hook's nomination subpage (there should have been a link to it in the credits section). View the edit history for that page Go back to the last version before the edit where the hook was promoted, and revert to that version to make the nomination active again. Add a new icon on the nomination subpage to cancel the previous tick and leave a comment after it explaining that the hook was removed from the prep area or queue, and why, so that later reviewers are aware of this issue. Add a transclusion of the template back to this page so that reviewers can see it. It goes under the date that it was first created/expanded/listed as a GA. You may need to add back the day header for that date if it had been removed from this page. If you removed the hook from a queue, it is best to either replace it with another hook from one of the prep areas, or to leave a message at WT:DYK asking someone else to do so. How to move a nomination subpage to a new name[edit] Don't; it should not ever be necessary, and will break some links which will later need to be repaired. Even if you change the title of the article, you don't need to move the nomination page. Nominations[edit] Older nominations[edit] Articles created/expanded on September 2[edit] Articles created/expanded on September 27[edit] Roman campaigns in Germania (12 BC – AD 16) ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that the Romans won a series of campaigns against the Germanic tribes following the disaster at Teutoburg, but decided to leave Germany because its land was not considered valuable? Source: Wells (2003), The Battle That Stopped Rome, pp. 206–7 Improved to Good Article status by SpartaN (talk). Self-nominated at 03:34, 29 September 2021 (UTC). General eligibility: New Enough: Y Long Enough: Y Other problems: Y Policy compliance: Adequate sourcing: Y Neutral: Y Free of copyright violations, plagiarism, and close paraphrasing: Y Other problems: Y Hook eligibility: Cited: N - Source is offline but happy to AGF. However, in the article the statement “they considered German lands too poor for annexation” is sourced to p.204 of Wells. pp.206-7 referred to above is used to support that they that “it was too costly in economic and military resources” to go into in Germany. I guess either way the hook is sourced but could you clarify the exact sourcing of the hook. Interesting: Y QPQ: None required. Overall: Interesting thorough article, well-written with good quality sourcing. Earwig shows no issues. Just a minor query around the hook sourcing but otherwise will be good to go. DeCausa (talk) 08:23, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @DeCausa: I found the web link that (for me) shows a preview if you're able to see it: https://books.google.com/books?id=mc30CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA206&lpg=PA206 SpartaN (talk) 10:07, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @SpartaN: Thanks for providing the link. It’s prompted a couple of thoughts for me. Firstly, Wells doesn’t seem to be saying the reason for the withdrawal is definitively known (“… the reasons for these decisions must have lain…”) i.e he’s making an assumption, however well founded. The hook is more definite than Wells is. Secondly, Wells’ emphasis is on the strength of the resistance being behind the reason - the poor value of the territory makes it “not worth it” because of the strength of the resistance. That’s not quite the same as just saying the land wasn’t valuable. (I notice the text you used in the article on this reflects that effort/value ratio issue.) To fix both points would you be prepared to consider an ALT1 which after “…Teutoburg” continues something along the lines of “…likely decided to leave Germany because the military effort was out of proportion to the territory’s value?” although there may need to be some trimming to get it into the 200 character limit. DeCausa (talk) 11:12, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @SpartaN and DeCausa: It's been over a month since the last comments here, have there been any updates? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:31, 13 November 2021 (UTC) From my point of view I’m waiting for SpartaN’s reply to my last post here. But I notice they haven’t edited Wikipedia since then, over a month ago. So I’m not quite sure what can be done. DeCausa (talk) 08:17, 13 November 2021 (UTC) I see. Given that there's really only one issue holding the nomination back, would anyone be willing to adopt this in case SpartaN doesn't return? It would be a shame if the nomination failed at this point. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 06:35, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I’m not sure what exactly are the DYK rules on this but, subject to that, options could be (a) I propose an ALT1 hook and someone else signs it off; (b) someone else proposes an ALT1 hook and I sign it off; (c) if anyone disagrees with me on the original hook I’m happy to step away and they sign it off. DeCausa (talk) 11:04, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I've looked at the Wells source and concur that it is saying the withdrawal was more down to the ratio of effort required to potential reward, and have boldly tweaked the copy in the article to reflect this. For what it's worth, I think ALT1 works just fine. firefly ( t · c ) 11:16, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Ok. I’m just going to formalize the ALT1 and let someone else add the tick and sign off: ALT1:... that the Romans won a series of campaigns against the Germanic tribes after the disaster at Teutoburg but likely decided to leave Germany as the effort was out of proportion to the territory’s value? DeCausa (talk) 12:07, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Since the reviewer has proposed a new hook, another editor will be needed to sign this off. I'm not sure though if the section linking in the bold links is allowed, however. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:29, 15 November 2021 (UTC) sorry, I missed that. It’s not even necessary to link to a section of the article so I’ve taken it out of ALT1. DeCausa (talk) 08:21, 15 November 2021 (UTC) As this doesn’t seem to be moving I’m going to give ALT1 the tick as original reviewer. If the DYK regulars think this is out of process because I came up nwith ALT1 then happy for it to be reverted. DeCausa (talk) 22:46, 21 November 2021 (UTC) DeCausa, there is no rush to approve, and your approval of your own hook was indeed out of process. I have reverted SL93's promotion of the nomination to prep, and with any luck a new reviewer will be around soon enough to review your ALT1. (SL93, you're welcome to review it, but that means you cannot also promote it.) I've also struck the original hook due to the issues noted above. BlueMoonset (talk) 04:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) BlueMoonset Sorry for mixing up who approved it. SL93 (talk) 04:26, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I didn't notice the second sentence of the approval...not sure how that happened. Sorry, again. SL93 (talk) 04:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) DeCausa Reading through the article again, your ALT1 hook seems to be mostly verifed in the Aftermath section, but I'm not seeing any indication of it being "likely". SL93 (talk) 21:14, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, that’s true. Where that came from was, in the above discussion with SpartaN on the original hook, they cited Wells in support. Wells says, in relation to Tiberius’ decision to ‘give up’, that “The reason for these decisions must have lain in the Germans’ tough resistance”. I’ve taken that to mean Wells’ was inferring Tiberius’ reasoning without direct evidence (or certainty) of Tiberius’ actual reason. However, you’re right that the way the article is written is more certain. I’m ok striking the “likely” or, possibly it would be better to amend the final sentence of the first paragraph of the Aftermath section to be more reflectve of Wells. DeCausa (talk) 21:48, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I will leave this here for someone else to look at. It would be helpful if the nominator came back. SL93 (talk) 23:21, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Articles created/expanded on October 9[edit] Pankratius Pfeiffer ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that Salvatorian priest Pankratius Pfeiffer saved hundreds of Jews in Rome during the Second World War? Reviewed: 1936 Northeast Flood Created by Ergo Sum (talk). Self-nominated at 17:52, 9 October 2021 (UTC). New article that was created on 9 October 2021? is 3,212 characters and nominated on the same day. No copyvios detected and duplication detector of [1][2][3][4][5] reveal no close paraphrasing issues (AGF PDF docs which can't go through Dup detector). Article is well-sourced. Hook is 103 characters long (under 200 character max.) and is interesting. Refs 4 and 5 (verifying the hook) are reliable sources. QPQ done. Looks good to go! —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:41, 9 October 2021 (UTC) Too many red flags here. If he really saved hundreds of Jews, you would expect plenty of confirmation of this in scholarly sources and him to be recognized by Yad Vashem. I can't count the number of times that I've seen mainstream newspapers print completely false stories about Jews being rescued during the holocaust, so better sources are definitely needed to confirm these extraordinary claims. Thanks Brigade Piron for letting me know about this. (t · c) buidhe 16:51, 10 October 2021 (UTC) I have to admit I'm just a bit perplexed by the argument. Except in fairly uncommon cases of multiple RS that contradict each other, we don't generally recognize any "hierarchy" of reliable sources. Sources are either RS or they are not. So I'm not sure what kind of sources you have in mind as "better" sources. The ones currently cited in the article are all RS, so that should be the end of it. I might add that if you seek some manner of official imprimatur in the vein of Yad Vashem, the City of Rome named a street after him. Your point about why there isn't more extensive coverage of this historical figure is well taken but can easily be attributed to the fact that all manner of historical figures are lost to history, especially those who are notable really for one major event in their life that did not come to light until years later, as is the case here. Indeed, one of the RS in this article describes Pfeiffer as being "lost to history." I'm adding the new review icon here so that we can get at least one more editor's evaluation of this. Ergo Sum 13:32, 16 October 2021 (UTC) There are very few people who actually saved hundreds of Jews during the Holocaust and plenty of hoaxes that were reported as truth by various news organizations—for example Necdet Kent. In other cases, actual rescue did occur but the numbers are greatly exaggerated and repeated uncritically by news organizations, such as Raoul Wallenberg. If the story is true you would expect to see it covered in many more credible sources. There are plenty of cases where a source is reliable for some info but not others. For example, someone's CV is often reliable for "they worked at X organization" but not "they are a world expert in Z". Extraordinary claims require extraordinary sourcing. (t · c) buidhe 21:27, 16 October 2021 (UTC) I should say that I share Buidhe's concerns. I think saying that "all manner of historical figures are lost to history" rather side-steps the sheer volume of historical scholarship on all aspects of the Holocaust. On a more banal note, I think part of the problem is that the sources cited are, essentially, all journalistic sources published by explicitly Catholic or Salvatorian outlets. The specific sources cited for the "saved" claim are Romereports (I am not familiar with this outlet, but the typo in the video does not inspire confidence) and a self-published Salvatorian newsletter. Neither are scholarly sources and both are, again, explicitly confessional in nature. I think WP:BIASED may on point in a highly sensitive issue touching on the wider disputes about Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust. Do we know what the Samerski book says, for example? —Brigade Piron (talk) 08:55, 17 October 2021 (UTC) Buidhe It is true that the sources cover Catholic issues, but only the Salvatorian one is actually published by a Catholic institution. I need not go into how varied Catholic newspapers are in their adherence/faithfulness to the Catholic hierarchy and beliefs (see e.g. National Catholic Reporter versus National Catholic Register). But more direclty, there actually are many scholarly RS that discussion Pfeiffer and his works in Nazi-occupied Rome. You will find them on the other language versions of this article. The problem is that I do not read Italian or German well enough to use them in the article. Coverage is not the issue. It is English language coverage. Ergo Sum 13:48, 17 October 2021 (UTC) @Ergo Sum: perhaps add the word "reportedly" before "saved". I'm inclined to accept in good faith the sources used as reliable – none of them have not been deprecated nor deemed generally unreliable. —Bloom6132 (talk) 16:41, 26 October 2021 (UTC) DYK should not cover unconfirmed reports or rumors so I strongly disagree with that suggestion. As well as assuming sources are reliable if they've never been discussed at WP:RSN, which disregards important parts of WP:RS such as WP:CONTEXTMATTERS. There is no issue with citing sources in Italian or German, but if it's not confirmed that they support the content then it's incorrect to assume that they do. (t · c) buidhe 20:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Bloom6132: I tend to think that statements are either supported by RS and written in wikivoice or they're not accepted at all. For that reason, I shy away from words like "reportedly." I reiterate though that I think it's quite clear there's nothing wrong with the sources currently used. They're all RS, so that should be the end of it. Hence, why I think your initial review was satisfactory. Ergo Sum 23:40, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Ergo Sum: agreed. I'm still of the view that the hook satisfies criteria 3b. Criteria 4 states that "Nominations should be rejected if an inspection reveals that they are not based on reliable sources". That is not the case here. —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) You're still ignoring the principle in RS that context matters, and some sources are reliable for some but not other info. The two of us who actually write on Holocaust related topics have expressed that the sources cited are not reliable for the exceptional claims being made. (t · c) buidhe 23:59, 26 October 2021 (UTC) With all due respect, I am of the opinion that the sources used are reliable for the info in the hook. The fact that you and Brigade Piron write on Holocaust-related topics is irrelevant – it does not confer a veto over hooks pertaining to that subject. By that logic, I should be able to veto baseball or heraldry hooks ... —Bloom6132 (talk) 01:10, 27 October 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: Three of my DYKs promoted (including Coat of arms of the Falkland Islands from August this year) have included the word "reportedly" in the hook, as well as numerous hooks from other editors. Disagree all you want – this is accepted practice at DYK. —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: I'm aware that you have experience writing about Holocaust-related articles and I put value in your assessment as a solid editor. However, I'm quite comfortable in my ability to vet RS, as well, and my confidence in these sources means I must disagree with your opinion here. Experienced editors do disagree at times, and it is my opinion that I think you have gotten this one wrong; doubtless, you think the same for me. I haven't seen any evidence that these are not RS. Therefore, I recommend if Bloom6132 is inclined to do so, to renew their approval of the hook. In the meantime, I'm going to request the input of additional experienced editors on the DYK talk page. Ergo Sum 01:28, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm going to ping @Bamse, Bermicourt, Jmabel, and Anyfile to see if we can find some reliable sources in other languages. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 01:46, 27 October 2021 (UTC) Oops, @AnyFile theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 01:47, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm currently traveling & very busy, so not much help here, I'm afraid. - Jmabel | Talk 01:53, 27 October 2021 (UTC) That said, more or less this same case is made in The Pope's Jews: The Vatican's Secret Plan to Save Jews from the Nazis by Gordon Thomas (not currently cited in the article). - Jmabel | Talk 02:00, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm unclear as to why the cited sources are unreliable: are we assuming that all information emanating from a Roman Catholic source is unreliable? If so what's the logic? In any case there are dozens of book sources in English, German, French and Italian that mention Pfeiffer, the problem is that few are accessible online. One is an entire biography of Pfeiffer "from baker to Vatican diplomat" which would be useful to track down: Willer, Philomena (2005). P. Pankratius Pfeiffer SDS: (1872-1945); vom Bäckergesellen zum Vatikandiplomat. Pub: Josef Fink. Others that mentions Pfeiffer and the Jews in Rome are: Liebhart (1996) Schwangau. Meding (1992), Flucht vor Nürnberg. Sinn (1976), Illegal. Bermicourt (talk) 08:41, 27 October 2021 (UTC) My issue is with the unreliability of journalistic works and popular history, which have in many cases published inaccurate information about rescues of Jews during the Holocaust. If better sources exist, they should be cited instead. An additional question is, do these sources actually support the claim of "hundreds" of Jews rescued by Pfeiffer personally? (t · c) buidhe 08:51, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I've now found sources that cover most of the article. Here are more: Liebhart (1996) Schwangau. Meding (1992), Flucht vor Nürnberg. Sinn (1976), Illegal. Prince Constantine of Bavaria (1952) Der Papst. Layer (1985), Schwäbisches Ehrenbuch - Pfeiffer credited with "saving Rome and other Italian cities including Chieti, Ascoli and Ovieto from destruction and other calamities" _ (1999). Publik-Forum - Pfeiffer the only German to have a street named after him in Rome and who fought to save Roman Jews. _ (1960). Bayerische Frömmigkeit - Pfeiffer described as the "Saviour of Rome and other cities in Italy" Robert Katz has written a number of books - Death in Rome (1967), Black Sabbath (1969), The Battle for Rome (2010) - which all mention Pfeiffer. Bottum and Dalin (2004). The Pius War has this interesting piece: "7. Pancrazio [sic] Pfeiffer. According to Carroll-Abbing, one of the men used by Pius XII to protest the Nazi roundup of Rome's Jews and intervene for persecuted victims was Father Pancrazio Pfeiffer, superior general of the Salvatorian Fathers, who also served as Pius XII' personal liaison to the German military command in Rome. Because Pfeiffer died tragically in an automobile accident toward the end of the war and thus never took part in the postwar analysis of Pius XII's conduct, many historians have overlooked him. But those who knew him or have researched his life have chronicled his collaborative efforts with Pius XII to rescue Jews and others during the war. See the article "Pfeiffer's List" by Robert Graham, 30 Days, June 1994, pp. 42-46. Prince Constantine of Bavaria's book on Pius XII, The Pope (London: Allan Wingate, 1954) [listed above] contains an excellent section on Pfeiffer, whom he describes as an agent for the pope on behalf of the victims of persecution and the fugitives in hiding" (p. 213). At Pfeiffer's death in May 1945, Vatican Radio paid tribute: "He came into contact with the Commander of the German occupying forces [in Rome in 1943-44]. From that day onwards, he placed his religious and spiritual qualities at the service of many who had been arrested or already condemned to death. He helped countless people in this way, and saved their lives, among them many Jews and other Italian personages. He championed..." In short there seems to be book evidence for virtually everything stated in the article apart from the specific details of the two incidents where 249 or 400 Jews were rescued. Based on my initial searches my expectation is that those incidents are likely to be recorded in the literature - we just need to be able to access more of the sources. Meanwhile there is no harm in pausing to use some of the above sources, plus those I've added to the Further reading section of the article in order to reinforce the existing references and then review where we are.

For example, Salvatorians USA Province is not independent of the article subject and therefore is not reliable for self-serving assertions such as "he saved many Jews in Rome from persecution and ultimately death" or "Every day, Pfeiffer visited the Regina Coeli prison and another prison on Via Tasso, where he would often return with freed prisoners who had been sentenced to death." (t · c) buidhe 08:27, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: would you still object if the article instead relied on the sources found by Bermicourt? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 04:58, 5 November 2021 (UTC) Depends, the Samerski source looks reliable to me but the book published by "Österreichische Provinz der Salvatorianer" has the same issue of close connection to the article subject. (t · c) buidhe 06:27, 5 November 2021 (UTC) All right. @Ergo Sum: I'm not going to promote the nomination without consensus to move forward, so if you want to try and rework the article's sourcing to approval, that can work.

This slipped my mind completely this weekend. I will deal with this tonight. Ergo Sum 15:45, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I have added several inline citations to the article, which refer to sources that were (very helpfully) added by Bermicourt. These sources support several of the very specific claims in the article, as well as the general thrust of the article which is in dispute here, namely that Pfeiffer was a liaison and in that capacity saved many Jews and others from the Nazis. In light of these reliable sources supporting the general claims, I think any concern about the pre-existing ones describing some of his more specific actions is ameliorated. There is a trove of additional sources in the Further Reading section that additionally describe in much greater detail Pfeiffer's actions but they are either in a foreign language which I do not adequately read to make use of as citations or are offline. All being said, I think there is now ample sourcing to back up the article's claims. Ergo Sum 05:49, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks, Ergo Sum—@Buidhe:, if this sourcing is up to your standards, we can move ahead. If not, we're probably going back to WT:DYK and asking for more eyes. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 05:52, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Hi, I've flagged the specific content in the article that supports the hook as needing a better source. There are other active cleanup tags on the article as well. However, I think there's sufficient sourcing for a modified version of the hook without the words "hundreds of".

Bermicourt (talk) 08:33, 17 November 2021 (UTC) According to the source it's what Vatican Radio said about him after his death. DYK is not for eulogies imo. (t · c) buidhe 08:37, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I'm not following—is the source unreliable because it's after his death? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 08:40, 17 November 2021 (UTC) No, it's because it's Catholic presumably... We could always add "according to Vatican Radio..." But better still, we just need to cite the exact text from one of the many non-Catholic book sources and the problem will be solved. Bermicourt (talk) 08:46, 17 November 2021 (UTC) And yet another source: O'Reilly (2001) in Forgotten Battles: Italy's War of Liberation 1943-45 states that "the Vatican was able to assist many of Rome's Jews and others sought by the Germans through Father Pancrazio Pfeiffer's intervention with the Germans... His work was recounted by Robert Graham who has written extensively on the Vatican's role in World War II." Bermicourt (talk) 09:01, 17 November 2021 (UTC) And another: Bartley (2016) in Catholics Confronting Hitler states that "Father Pancrace [sic] Pfeiffer, a German priest and the superior general of the Salvatorian Order, was the pope's liaison with the German military. Several hundred hostages, including some under sentence of death, owed their release to the efficacious intervention of Father Pfeiffer." I don't know why I'm doing this - you can look up the references yourselves instead of opining and speculating from the sidelines in the classic Wikipedia way. :) Bermicourt (talk) 09:08, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @Bermicourt: Since it seems you have access to several sources that I do not (probably just requires further digging), would you want to add them as inline citations with page numbers, especially to support the proposition regarding hundreds of people saved?

I'd be in favor instead of the hook being split into two separate proposals: one hook about the fact that she was an internet celebrity who grew up in a place without tap water, and a separate hook about her going viral for making hamburgers. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:23, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Full review needed, which can also address the issue of the borderline ALT1 hook. BlueMoonset (talk) 04:23, 5 November 2021 (UTC) As far as I can tell the article meets DYK requirements, and a QPQ has been done. Earwigs finds a close match with Coda Media, but that's only because it was the source for quotes in the article, and all of them are properly referenced. I find the first hook hard to believe given China's international standing, and in any case as brought up by Bowlhover may be inaccurate anyway. As for the second hook, as I mentioned before it's ineligible as it's exactly 200 characters long, and per WP:DYK hooks that are at or shorter than 200 characters may be rejected per reviewer's discretion. Both ALT0 and ALT1 have struck: I am repeating my earlier suggestion that ALT1 instead be split into two separate hooks. As this is a China-related article and there appear to be some political discussion in the article, I'd also like to ask for a second opinion from someone more knowledgeable about China-related articles if the article doesn't fall afoul of relevant guidelines. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 13:12, 6 November 2021 (UTC) From Wikipedia:Did you know#The hook: The hook should be concise: no more than about 200 characters (including spaces and the question mark, but not including the ..., the space immediately following the ..., or any (pictured)). While 200 is a hard limit, hooks near or at this limit may still be rejected at the discretion of reviewers and administrators. This tool can be used for counting words. The guideline says that "200 is a hard limit", so it is not true that the 200-character ALT1 hook is "ineligible" or "simply too long". No reason has been given for rejecting a 200-character hook "at the discretion of reviewers". Here are two additional hooks based on the suggestion: ALT2: ... that Dianxi Xiaoge, who grew up in a remote Yunnan mountain without running water, is an Internet celebrity with roughly 16 million subscribers on all her platforms? ALT3: ... Dianxi Xiaoge went viral in China and internationally after making hamburgers for her grandparents who had never eaten them before? Cunard (talk) 07:48, 7 November 2021 (UTC) Well for one thing, the original was very difficult to read and seemed to combine too many facts into one hook. Usually DYK prefers simpler hooks whenever possible. In any case, I think ALT3 is the best hook here and the nomination is otherwise good to go, I'd just like to hear a second opinion from another editor on the article tone given that I'm a bit uncomfortable doing a solo review here given the "Commentary" section delves into some political matters. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:36, 7 November 2021 (UTC) On second thought, I have some concerns regarding the length of the article. Isn't it rather detailed for an internet celebrity's page? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 11:10, 7 November 2021 (UTC) That the article is "rather detailed for an internet celebrity's page" should not be a concern. The sources provided substantial analysis of her and her work, and this article reflects those sources. Other detailed articles for Internet celebrities include PewDiePie and MrBeast. Cunard (talk) 11:18, 7 November 2021 (UTC) Pinging Gatoclass for his input, as he responded to a discussion I raised about this nomination over at WT:DYK. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:57, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I don't think we need Gatoclass to restate themself. Here's what they said at WT:DYK: The article doesn't use the phrase "one of only three Chinese influencers to gain international influence", so I'm not sure where you got that, but it does say she is one of only three "Chinese Internet celebrities who have reached international prominence", and the problem with that claim is that it's sourced to an article that is two years old and therefore not up-to-date. With regard to the overall length, I would agree that it is overly detailed and could use a trim. I'm not sure this is relevant to DYK however, as "overly detailed" is not one of our criteria. What I would say is that the level of detail does raise the chances of close paraphrasing so the article would need to be carefully checked for that. Anybody else with an opinion on this article?

Thriley (talk) 20:57, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @Thriley: I'll ping BlueMoonset here in case I'm wrong, but I'm going to say no, it isn't. My reasoning here is that if the hook were read as plaintext, without any bolding or linking, it would be read as pretty much only interesting as it concerns the plot. The hook should concern Smit's life; if it concerns her work as an actress, only stating her role and not anything about production doesn't make the hook out-of-universe. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 21:28, 17 November 2021 (UTC) theleekycauldron, I was taking a look at the ALT1 hook and its sources, and the second Biography sentence is basically copied from Esquire—the Google translate version, at any rate. That's a problem. Another problem is that the source doesn't actually say that she was working as a hotel receptionist when she got the call, just that it was "one of these jobs", referring back to the four in the previous sentence, none of which were hotel receptionist. The article also needs a bit of copyediting. I don't think that either of the plot-based hooks should be used, and as Drmies notes, "first film" is not accurate, since it's Cross the Line that's in the source, which appears to be her fifth film. We could only use "first feature film" if the previous four in her filmography were all short films (which would need to be clearly sourced). Perhaps an angle for the information in ALT1 would be to say she was working in whatever job it was when she was cast in Cross the Line, for which she was nominated as best new actress in the Goya Awards. BlueMoonset (talk) 02:31, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Here’s an article that states she was working as a receptionist two years before she was hired to work on Parallel Mothers:[6] Does it appear reliable? Thriley (talk) 05:38, 20 November 2021 (UTC) I don't see a reason to doubt the source. However, it isn't sufficient to support the "when she was called" hook claim, just that she was a hotel receptionist two years before the article was written (and possibly two years and a number of months, since you can't assume it's exactly two years). BlueMoonset (talk) 17:14, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Perhaps the hook should include all her various jobs before her Almodovar role? Thriley (talk) 01:47, 23 November 2021 (UTC) ALT3 “before starring in the Pedro Almodóvar film Parallel Mothers, Milena Smit worked as a model, waitress, shop assistant, babysitter, teleoperator, subway information assistant, and hotel receptionist?” El País Thriley (talk) 01:51, 23 November 2021 (UTC) That hook is 197 characters which puts it in discretionary territory.

I do like the hooks and it's an intriguing subject for an article! I wanted to flag the following comments, in case they are helpful (please ignore if not!): I don't quite follow this sentence in the lead: "Moreover, it is still pointed out that the emendation Albruna agrees with the names of other Germanic wise women." Should "instriptions" (before the Drusus heading) be "inscriptions"? Should the names of scholars be wikilinked, where there is a page for the author (e.g. Simek)? What does mss mean, and could this be explained when it is first referenced? The second paragraph of the Aurinia section has two sentences starting with "However" in a row, which is a bit awkward to read.

To be expected, since they're cited almost 20 times each, and since the vast majority of the matches concern long quotes I'm willing to overlook it, but can we add more citations throughout the paragraphs? Particularly with "Conflict with Miles and Reynolds", there's four citations crammed at the end of the section. I think we should cite each after the corresponding sentences, especially where there's a direct quotation.

Its long enough and new and lots of good refs - including the hook fact. It documents a notable woman from the 14th century and there were not many of those.

Nice addition. well done Victuallers (talk) 10:31, 6 November 2021 (UTC) Reopening this because I think the hook is misleading, as according to the source it was usual for women of the nobility, like Neville, to sign with their own names.

We don't need to say it's unusual if we phrase it that way theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 02:14, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Theleekycauldron, the problem with both hooks is that they imply that there was something out-of-the-ordinary in a woman signing something in her own name in that era, whereas the source indicates that was normal practice for women of the nobility. So the hooks are misleading. Gatoclass (talk) 02:19, 19 November 2021 (UTC) All right—I'll ping @Lajmmoore and Victuallers: back here, y'all can work this out. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 02:33, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Was it usual for women in the fourteenth century to sign with their own name ... no. Is is usual for women in the 21st century to sign with just their first name? No. So "did you know that unusually Canada's head of state signs documents with just her first name and an R for Regina?" (Someone shouts) "BUT all British Queens do that!!" (Someone shouts) "That implies that it was unusual for Queens to sign with just their first name." No it doesnt. I think @Gatoclass: is reading the source and then saying that the hook doesnt explain every piece of information in the source... which obviously it doesnt. Its unusual that "a woman" is doing this at all. It WAS unusual for women in the fourteenth century to sign and if they did then they did not usually use just their own name. Its a fact - its unusual. Did You know that women did not sign their own names on documents in the 14th century? No I didnt. That is something that Lajmmoore wrote about and now I know. Thanks. Victuallers (talk) 08:28, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Hello Gatoclass all so the part of the source I was using is this, which is talking about signatures for charitable donation "Although most of the widows declare themselves to be the wife of their late husband, or their father's daughter, others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names, such as 'domina Margareta de Longvl' and 'don-ýina Margareta de Nevill' (the same person). The majority of widows declare that their marital status and their power to act, using a variety of phrases, including 'in pura viduitate', 'in pura viduitate mea et ligia potestate', and 'in viduitate mea propria et potestate legitima' ..." and I read that as it was more usual for (noble) women to use a signature that described them as "wife of, etc..." I read the passage as Legg using Margaret de Neville as an unusual example. Legg is talking about the Coucher Book signatures specifically, but I still think they are marking out unusual practice. In terms of the hook, I wonder whether changing 'woman' to 'literate woman' might work? Lajmmoore (talk) 09:32, 19 November 2021 (UTC) No, it wouldn't work just to add "literate". And your reading of the text just amounts to an unsupported assumption on your part. Because while the text could admittedly be less ambiguous, the statement that others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names does not in any way suggest that it was rare or unusual for a member of the nobility to give their name, it only states that members of the nobility as a class were inclined to give their names. So there isn't sufficient support in that statement for a hook which implies that Neville's act was in any way unusual for a member of her class. The hook makes Neville sound like some sort of proto-feminist who boldly challenged the system, when the underlying source only indicates that either her entire class did the same thing, or at least that it was an accepted practice for members of the nobility. So I still think that either the hook needs to be substantially reworked to more closely reflect the source, or a new hook be found. Gatoclass (talk) 02:53, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks for sharing your interpretation of your text Gatoclass. My interpretation (& so the hook) is based on Legg's use of the word most - in that "most of the widows declare themselves to be the wife of their late husband, or their father's daughter" and you rightly point out "others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names" but I think that needs to be balanced by the "most" earlier in the sentence i.e. for women generally, they don't give their name, but some noble women do but overall, for women signing their name, it is unusual enough to be pointed out in the text.

Whispyhistory (talk) 04:04, 13 November 2021 (UTC) @Whispyhistory: But that would be impossible, the article can't possibly mention IP addresses, it's about broken toes.

It's okay with me if allowed (dyk says hook needs to be in article and in the following ref). Whispyhistory (talk) 06:32, 13 November 2021 (UTC) I don't see that exact sequence of numbers in the source, although there are others that look a bit like an IP address. The trouble is, the nominator seems to be the source for it looking a bit like an IP address, which it does, but we can't use that unless the source makes a similar point, which it does not appear to do. Something like this might work (numbers might need to be changed as mentioned): ALT1 ... that a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone may be described as 88.5.3.2? Philafrenzy (talk) 10:16, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Regarding the image, it's a fun idea but I don't think we run images as quizzes and the image is simply a skeletal foot, and not closely enough related to the hook.

I don't see how the hook you're suggesting is hooky. What exactly is wrong with the hook proposed? It's in the article and it's supported by the sources cited. And the image is directly related to the hook. It engages the reader into a spotting game. Dr. Vogel (talk) 14:57, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Like everyone else, I rather like the IP-address hook. If we wikilinked IP address, it would be supported in the linked articles, and fulfill the requirement that anyone following the links will be able to verify the hook. I don't think we need sourcing that says that a specific sequence of numbers is an IP address, as we have sources giving the general format of an IP address, and creating an example would be a trivial calculation ("Are all four of these numbers separated by periods in the range 0-255?"): "IPv4 and IPv6 address formats". www.ibm.com. An IPv4 address has the following format: x . x . x . x where x is called an octet and must be a decimal value between 0 and 255. Octets are separated by periods. An IPv4 address must contain three periods and four octets. The following examples are valid IPv4 addresses: 1 . 2 . 3 . 4 01 . 102 . 103 . 104 This hook is better than any alternative I can think of, and I don't see anything likely to be problematic about it (it's certainly verifiable). I think we might be in agreement on that? So if some rule technically prohibits it, we might have a good case for applying the WP:Ignore all the rules policy. Broken finger is also currently DYK-eligible and I think it uses the same numbering scheme.[1] HLHJ (talk) 02:07, 14 November 2021 (UTC) [edit: add fulltext url] I don't necessarily agree with the reading of WP:DYKCRIT 3b ( Each fact in the hook must be supported in the article by at least one inline citation to a reliable source [...]) that says that the IP thing needs to be in the article (compare e.g. Template:Did you know nominations/Urine deflector, which similarly took some creative licence in how the proposed hooks were phrased beyond what was stated in either the article or the cited source), and I agree with HLHJ that WP:IAR would be applicable regardless. As for the hooks themselves, writing "a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone may be described as 88.5.3.2" is a much poorer way of writing the hook (less "hooky") than the converse, i.e. "88.5.3.2 may refer to a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone". TompaDompa (talk) 11:28, 14 November 2021 (UTC) This. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 17:01, 16 November 2021 (UTC) We can't use IP address because the nominator just thought it up "oh, that looks like an IP address". It's not in the source as the nominator admits and therefore is not verifiable. And so what if it does look like an IP address? What does that tell us about broken toes? I like clever or quirky hooks and have written many (if I may say so), but they have to be based on something in the sources otherwise it's things made up one day. Philafrenzy (talk) 10:19, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you for all your comments. This is not the place to ignore all rules. The proposed hook is not supported by the source given in the article. I am inclined to approve ALT1 but it needs checking, unless another hook is proposed. Whispyhistory (talk) 15:11, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Oh dear, this has become contentious. I think the contended question is whether it's acceptable to have verified information not found in the nominated article, but only in another article, linked in the hook. Not as hooky, but for illustration: ALT3 ... that the dot-decimal notation string "88.5.3.2" is not only an an IPv4 address, but also a fracture in the middle of the bone at the tip of the little toe? "IPv4 and IPv6 address formats". www.ibm.com., Hallux proximal phalanx fracture in adults: an overlooked diagnosis I don't think we're debating whether the IP-address-hook statement is verifiable. The statement that "88.5.3.2" (and any number in that format) is a valid IPv4 address is supported by the IP address article and the IPv4 article, and this format is the subject of the Dot-decimal notation article. No-one had bothered to cite those statements in those articles, but since they've been challenged here, I've now cited them. So "88.5.3.2 is both an IP address[1] and a code for a broken toebone[2]" is certainly verifiable, and is now verified on Wikipedia. Any DYK reader should have no trouble verifying that the hook is accurate. Alternatives that do not mention IP addressees are not as hooky, but don't contain more information about broken toes: ALT4 ... that "88.5.3.2" is a toe fracture in the middle of the bone at the tip of the little toe, while a "78.5.3.2" is the parallel broken finger?

Philafrenzy (talk) 19:25, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you Philafrenzy ( a very experienced DYK contributor) for your efforts in helping new editors understand DYK. Your comment higher up about "88.5.3.2" and "ip address" not being in the source is true and I am grateful for your suggested alts. Essentially, the initial and subsequent hooks sound good, but none are in the article or the source. I don't wish for personal comments and don't mind if someone else wishes to take over here. With due respect @DrVogel: and @HLHJ:...You may wish to take this up at Wikipedia talk:Did you know. Whispyhistory (talk) 10:41, 15 November 2021 (UTC) I won't say I wish I hadn't written the article; I hope it's useful enough to make up for the social harm to the project here. I don't think the hostility was intended by anyone; I suspect that it's felt partly due to the ease of mininterpretation in a text-only medium and partly due to human cognitive biases.[2] I certainly did, and do, not intend it. I spent a day's editing trying to resolve the conflict by finding references specifically saying that the two things were in notation X and adding that text to the article, but unfortunately non-inductive descriptions of the notations seem to have been considered so needless that an Internet RFC attempting to formalize them died of disinterest. I did find a source that explicitly defines the IPv4 format, and one that explicitly says that 88.1.2.2 is a specific fracture, and I've cited the latter in the article, but I don't think this helps. It is probably a bit unreasonable to expect a reviewer to do more than apply rules as best they can, and Wikipedia talk:Did you know might indeed be a better forum for a more detailed discussion. I don't really want to take part in one, though (nothing to do with this discussion, prior reasons). I posted because I felt responsible for the conflict and thought I might be able to help. My impression is that I made it worse; my apologies to everyone I've offended. HLHJ (talk) 03:41, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Nobody is offended, but if I may say so I think you are still missing the point. IP addresses have nothing to do with broken toes even if that notation may have a similarity. That's why the sources don't make the comparison and why the IP-based hooks are no good. Any of the other hooks might be fine (I haven't checked the numbers) just without the bit about IP addresses. The whole thing reminds me of unusually shaped vegetables where you may see a carrot shaped like a foot, people who see faces in clouds, and even apophenia. My personal observation that one thing looks a bit like another is not the basis for a hook unless reliable sources make the point too. Philafrenzy (talk) 09:09, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Folks, we are wasting a wonderful hook. Really. IP addresses have nothing to do with broken toes even if that notation may have a similarity and that is the whole point of making good hooks. They are supposed to be short, punchy, catchy, and likely to draw the readers in to wanting to read the article – as long as they don't misstate the article content. And one of the best recipes to make a hook good is to make it sound counterintuitive With any other option but the original, we are bound to receive another hook frequented by maybe a few hundred visitors. I would propose something to the tune of in some contexts, 88.5.3.2 might not mean an IP address but a broken bone in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone? so that no one claims here that we somehow delegitimise the IP address but at the same time so that we preserve the core of the hook. As for the claims that because the hook is not cited in the IP part, it can't be there - please don't be that pedantic. In our today's world of informatics we may assume that people who visit Wikipedia more or less imagine what IP addresses are, and may more or less imagine how they look like (in the worst case they will visit the article for details). The other part is cited. I see no problem with the original. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 17:01, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Szmenderowiecki I admit that I'm not very familiar with the topic, and the above discussion was confusing, but is the "this isn't an IP address" claim actually in the source? Because if it's not, then no matter how good the hook proposal is, it can't be used in a hook since hook facts need to be based on a reference. Also, I'm pretty sure that assumptions don't count as sources. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:31, 17 November 2021 (UTC) What I was leading is that we don't need to cite that the sky is blue, or that we have five fingers; or that there exist IP addresses for that matter.

We're allowed to. This is not a massive occasion where we can save the whole project by breaking the rules. Its a trivial example of what some (not all) think may be a breach in the rules, with a small, but amusing, advantage. So I'm not asking the defenders of the rules to admit that this is not a breech ... I am suggesting that they might just concede that the harm done by allowing this hook might not offend anyone ... and it might please a few thousand. Victuallers (talk) 15:28, 20 November 2021 (UTC) We don't need to break the rules. The observation that the notation looks a bit like an IP address is trivial and completely unrelated to broken toes. There are already perfectly good hooks above that work better. Nobody is saying don't use the numbers, just strike the bit about IP addresses. The originally proposed hook is not the work of comic genius and cleverness that some seem to think it is. Philafrenzy (talk) 21:58, 20 November 2021 (UTC) The main issue here is that it's one of the core rules of DYK that hook facts must be mentioned in the article, ideally explicitly or at least implied by supporting information. The thing is that at the moment, IP addresses are not mentioned anywhere in the article, so the hooks using the IP address angle would be ineligible according to that criterion anyway. Even April Fools hooks, which tend to be misleading, are still generally based on hook facts that are mentioned in the respective articles. So if we can't even grant IAR exemptions for that criterion for AFD hooks, the one day of the year where our hooks tend to follow the rules most loosely, I can't see why such a request should be granted here.

Nominated by Victuallers (talk) at 16:21, 6 November 2021 (UTC). Article is new enough. Two correct writers are credited. The article is fully referenced. No copyvio detected. There is a bit of biased POV pushing in Wikipedia voice: "most vulnerable to climate change". This will be something our subject is saying no doubt. And this idea is also reflected in the hook with "endangered". The hook content is referenced and confirmed by the Guardian, apart from the "endangered" bit, which opinion is attributed to Tina Stege. So I suggest that "endangered" is taken out of the hook, or it is reworded so it is clear she is saying that. Hook alt1 is unsuitable as it does not link the article and I cannot tell what it is trying to say in relation to the subject. I can confirm image is CC-BY-3.0 as derived from the video with CC-BY-3.0 license. However I would suggest that a different image is selected from the video, perhaps near the end where the microphone is not obscuring her chin. QPQ is done. Graeme Bartlett (talk) 06:03, 15 November 2021 (UTC) @Graeme Bartlett: Thanks for the review Graeme - I have recut a new image. Surprised that "endangered" wasn't referenced. I'm not sure it is just her opinion -"Projected sea level rise would mean 40% of the buildings in the Marshall Islands’ capital of Majuro would be permanently flooded and entire islands would disappear, potentially costing the Pacific country its status as a nation, according to a devastating new report from the World Bank." is a quote from the reference I have added to balance the idea that "endangered" might by pov.

Graeme Bartlett (talk) 20:56, 22 November 2021 (UTC) @Graeme Bartlett: Are you suggesting that we imply that "endangered" is her opinion despite the fact that she represents a nation and the "endangered" aspect is supported by the World Bank and the Guardian newspaper (and the 1bn people estimated to be part of the "High Ambition" group ) saying so? Is there any evidence that is just her opinion and not that of her country and the World Bank? Am I missing something? It you feel you need to give this "a cross" then can I suggest that we ask for a new reviewer?I have suggested an alt that does not use the endangered word.

Self-nominated at 23:51, 4 November 2021 (UTC). @DferDaisy: This article is about 3300 bytes, and was nominated for DYK shortly after creation, satisfying date and length criteria. There is a factual error, as the article states she was interred in Keokuk, Illinois, but the source says she died in Chicago, Illinois and was interred in Keokuk, Iowa. I am assuming good faith for a few references I cannot access (for example, ref 15 - The National Humane Review), which for me gives a landing page for the document, instead of an inside view). Otherwise, everything is properly sourced and there are no copyvio or close paraphrasing concerns (Earwig cites 3 potential problems, but they are not an issue here.) QPQ not required. Regarding the hooks, ALT0 is incorrect as stated, as it reads as if the study was conducted in the early 1900s by Meigs Crowder, whereas she published it in 1917 based on studies from that period. It'll need minor alteration. ALT1 is fine and sourced. I would prefer to promote an amended ALT0. A minor quibble, though not an issue for DYK: please add page numbers for cited sources. If online access is eliminated from the sources, it'll force anyone investigating those sources to wade through too many pages to find the desired detail.

AleatoryPonderings (???) (!!!) 01:52, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @AleatoryPonderings: Yes, but note that this court case is the "leading case with respect to the issue of common employers", establishing a precedent in Canadian law. At the time the lawsuit was filed, this was not the case, and in fact the trial judge ruled against Alouche (see last paragraph of background section); it was only after the case was brought to the Court of Appeal for Ontario that the "common employer doctrine" was established, and it became entrenched when leave to appeal the decision at the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed. Mindmatrix 15:11, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Ah, so the idea behind the hook is that, since Downtown Eatery changed the law on common employers, before Downtown Eatery Best Beaver would not have been Alouche's employer? That makes more sense. AleatoryPonderings (???) (!!!) 15:20, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: I'm going to inspect this again... Mindmatrix 15:18, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @AleatoryPonderings: Alright, so to ensure everything is correct, the following timeline occurred: Alouche was hired to be manager at For Your Eyes Only (owned by Grad and Grosman), and began work on 29 December 1992 Alouche was sent a Notice of Discipline in May 1993, and was fired on 15 June 1993 In October 1993, Alouche filed action for wrongful dismissal against Best Beaver Management Inc., as that was the source of his paycheques Best Beaver ceased operations in mid-1996, and all assets distributed to other companies owned by Grad and Grosman The trial resolved in favour of Alouche Best Beaver did not pay out the judgement (all its assets had been redistributed) Sherriffs were dispatched to For Your Eyes Only, where they seized $1,855 Downtown Eatery filed claim against Alouche, stating the cash belonged to it Alouche defended, and counterclaimed against Grad, Grosman, and all companies they controlled on the grounds of common employer doctrine, the oppression remedy of the Ontario Business Corporations Act, and fraudulent conveyance the judge in the second trial (at Ontario Superior Court of Justice) ruled against Alouche the case was brought to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, where the previous ruling was overturned in 2001 in January 2002, an application for leave to appeal the decision at the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed So, the common employer doctrine was part of the second trial as a counterclaim to the suit filed by Downtown Eatery. I just wanted to ensure this satisfies your concerns. Mindmatrix 18:25, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks for this incredibly thorough response. My concern is maybe philosophical or definitional. If I say that company A employs person B, that has an ordinary meaning and a legal meaning. It is probably right that Best Beaver did not employ Alouche in the ordinary sense of "employ", because Best Beaver was a "paymaster" and not the name on the front of the building where he went to work. My reading of the case itself is that, before Downtown Eatery, it was at best indeterminate as a legal matter whether Best Beaver, alone or in combination with its affiliate companies, employed Alouche. After Downtown Eatery, it was established—as a matter of legal meaning, but not necessarily ordinary meaning—that Best Beaver was his employer, or part of his employer, or something like that. The reason I brought this up is that it's not clear how one could verify the claim that "Best Beaver was not Alouche's employer", because that claim might be true as a matter of ordinary meaning but the only authoritative legal ruling we have on this (namely, Downtown Eatery) holds that the claim is false. In any event, I'll leave this to the eventual reviewer to sort out. I find my brain twisting into knots. AleatoryPonderings (???)

Interesting: N - see below Other problems: N - see below QPQ: None required. Overall: Hello, Mungo and welcome to DYK! Review as follows: The article is new enough, long enough and neutral. However, it includes a WP:IMDB source and I am unsure about the reliability of several other sources, including Film Ink, Queer Media Matters, Antaeus.org, Fern TV, Addicted to Horror Movies, Dan's Papers, Go Mag, Three Women in a Box and North Coast Rep. To add to that, the YouTube link does not appear to be uploaded by an official channel, making it unreliable. Additionally, per MOS:FILMCAST uncredited roles need a source. the copyvio checker showed up a 50%+ similarity with a source, which may suggest over quotation. On top of that, the subject has unclear notability. I'm unsure which roles are significant and The House on Pine Street appears to have a questionable notability. None of her awards seem significant and I'm not seeing any significant coverage from reliable, independent sources. ALT0 isn't very interesting given the festival is not significant enough to have an article. I think ALT1 is interesting but it seems to focus more on the character, not the actress which isn't exactly ideal... QPQ not needed. We'll need some work but we'll get there!

Thanks, DanCherek. while the article is over 1,500 prose characters, I'm going to be a stickler and say that this is still a stub.

Moving on, the article was created from a redir and nominated in time and is neutral, although I'm requesting a second opinion on the sourcing. The article seems to be plagiarism free, and a QPQ has been done. As for the hook, I'm not sure it quite checks out—is the church expected to break away? Because the article just says that a vote is planned and expected. Once we clear those two up, we're good to go. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 02:41, 21 November 2021 (UTC) @Theleekycauldron: Not entirely sure what the concern on the sourcing is; there are multiple reputable sources. Also, the lede is fairly clear that this is a planned schism, as the hook says. While I appreciate the review, I am dissatisfied with your effort.

Thanks! ~ Pbritti (talk) 05:10, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Isn't there a difference between "planned" (alt1) and "expected" (alt0)? planned implies it may or may not happen, expected is like forecasting—at least, that's how i read it. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 05:19, 21 November 2021 (UTC) @Theleekycauldron: Merriam-Webster considers them definitionally synonymous terms (see definition 2).

Maximilian Dood ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that in August 2021, YouTuber Maximilian Dood's viral social media campaign for Marvel vs. Capcom 2's rerelease caught the regards of studio Digital Eclipse, who expressed interest in rereleasing the game? Source: 1 and 2 Comment: This is the first time I’ve ever made a DYK here, so here goes. I personally find this fact interesting because it highlights how the advent of YouTube, and internet fame in general, has allowed people to use their voice to reach people in positions of high influence, bringing hidden ideas to light and advocating for change. While this specific example falls under a video game/pop-culture category, and may not fit Wikipedia’s desire for academic material, I feel that this is interesting enough to share, as it’s one the gaming community can relate to, like with other social media trends such as #FreeSmash and "Rerelease Mother 3." As for the article itself, all of the citations should be reliable enough; they’re all from third-party/secondary source outlets and there isn’t any BLP violation to be found here. One concern I have is criteria #3 - “Each fact in the hook must be supported in the article by at least one inline citation to a reliable source, appearing no later than the end of the sentence(s) offering that fact. Citations at the end of the paragraph are not sufficient.” While the hook is sourced in the article, the refs are at the end of the section rather than per each sentence. I can fix that however. Anyway, I hope this fact does get accepted! If not, I understand, thanks for reviewing this anyway. Created/expanded by PantheonRadiance (talk). Self-nominated at 08:45, 17 November 2021 (UTC).

Article is new enough, very newsworthy event and hence well-sourced, no copyvios (Earwig reports a false positive on the Johnson quotation), QPQ done.

Newness requirement satisfied by 5x expansion on 11/15 from < 600 to > 3000 characters. Articles also long enough and compliant with core policies on citations and neutrality. The hook is in-line sourced. Photo has appropriate license. QPQ is done. There are, however, two problems: (1) There is some significant overlap with this source. To start, the following sentence is taken from the source without use of quotation marks and with no effort to paraphrase rather than use the precise words: "Local advocacy led to the establishment of Bridle Trails as a state park in 1932." Further, this sentence also strikes me as too closely drawn from the same source: "Initial park development dates to 1933 when Civil Works Administration employees and federal relief workers were employed in state parks as part of the New Deal program. Further work included burning logging debris, clearing brush and building trails and fences." Work needs to be done to put the material into your own words. (2) The hook strikes me as boring in that it states an obvious point. Horses having the right of way on this trail is not unique or special. On trails that are shared by humans and horses, it is the general rule that horses have the right of way. See here ("In general, horses always have the right of way, followed by hikers, then by bikers."). See also here ("For safety reasons, if you come across a horse and rider on any trail they always have right of way. Hikers and bike riders all yield to horses.")

For one, the quote is not actually "could have been made by aliens" so, considering this is all about misquotation, we should either use the actual quote or clarify that it is a misquotation.

Graham87 09:41, 18 November 2021 (UTC) @Gerda Arendt: Thank you for the review. Diamonds were often cut in cabochon style in the 19th century and earlier. This one was cut with a flat bottom like all cabochons, and when viewed from above, it was a large oval, about 1.5 inches long. Modern cabochons usually have a smoothly rounded surface; this one was lightly faceted but the facets don't show on the sculpture. So it looks like half an egg, I suppose. The Koh-i-Noor is the large oval at the bottom of the picture. We have no specific citation for artistic licence - that is just a conclusion that we can probably make, since we have no evidence that Victoria ever had it set in a necklace. Therefore I cannot use "artistic licence" in a hook or in the article. I'll have a go at a hook using a full-length Victoria, and another hook using the Warrior and Wounded Youth sculpture. I'll come back shortly with those.

As for the hooks, I'm going to reject ALT0 out of hand, because Ben Comeau can take a number on that one. I'm also going to say no to ALT1, not because it's uncivil or uninteresting, but because it should be quoted—I've suggested two minor alts. A QPQ is also needed.

I've been trying to come up with something catchy on this -- for example, had Comeau invited Trump to participate in a performance of the work, then we could say he told Trump to fugue himself -- but the sourcing just isn't there that I can see. In consolation, here's an enlightening bit of musical history you will want to share with friends and family: Q: Why did Bach have so many children?

EEng 16:47, 17 November 2021 (UTC) The video for "Boris Johnson is a Lying Shit" includes a description from Comeau that basically screams for people not to vote for him, and the one for "Donald Trump is a Wanker" says "As satisfying as it is to poke fun at the Orange Monster, this video on its own probably won’t do the teeniest thing to reduce the devastation inflicted by the Trump administration. I therefore want to use this platform to suggest ways we can contribute to meaningful anti-Trump resistance.". We'd need to flesh out the article with these WP:BLPPRIMARY sources for the "thinks" to be properly verifiable.

Did you know that a recently discovered 1692 libretto of an actual Abendmusik bears similarities to Wacht! Euch zum Streit?[1][2]. Or that the Abendmusiken were actually presented right after Vespers?[3] Vespers, which themselves lasted two or three hours, in addition to a further three or four hour Hauptgottesdienst in the morning?[4][5] That might be one of the reasons why the audience was reported to be so disorderly, to the point that the town watch had to be hired to maintain a semblance of order.[6] That, and a lot more, which would surely allow to take this to DYK at a later time, after having greatly expanded this. Or at least, it's my opinion that taking the sole opportunity for DYK now would be a waste when it can be done when the article is expanded and made into something significantly more attractive and informative.

Fact is, I have the score and the whole text (including in translation) with me, in addition to lots of critical commentary on the piece itself (too much of which is focused on the question of authenticity, but alas...) and on the Abendmusiken in general. This can be used to make a proper article, but it would require time, which at the moment I really need to put into meeting an actual deadline than here. I've given you a list of pertinent sources (many of which are in German, if that's easier for you), if you're interested you know where to ask. On top of all of that, there's the question of article title (should it be at the current one or at Wacht! Euch zum Streit gefasset macht (a title which is used in a fair amount of sources, too...) Cheers, RandomCanadian (talk / contribs) 00:01, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Short version of what I replied on my talk: The time for it is in Advent. This year or next, that is the question. I'm also busy with other things, and both your familiarity with the topic, and your better English, make me wish you did it. For DYK, just raising attention is the goal. If you want it GA, we probably better wait. You decide. --Gerda Arendt (talk) 07:50, 22 November 2021 (UTC) The title: Wikipedia goes by the common title, and the other (and probably more) should be redirects.

Overall: Article meets eligibility criteria. i.e newness and article length. Article is well sourced and is neutral in tone. Hook is interesting and is cited. Copyvio scores ~20% in major part due to a quote that has been attributed rightly. However, the nominator might want to consider removing the quote and rewriting the sentence because the original Nepal Times article does not have it as a quote and is likely a paraphrasing done by the newspaper to begin with. Hence, we should not include it as a quote. In addition, I would encourage the nominator to consider expanding the article - to be clear, the article is good to go as-is. But looking at Hanuman Dhoka for instance there is an opportunity to build this article more than just a "History" section. Handing it back to the nominator. Some work and this is ready for homepage.

According to page 217 of "Account of the Late Granville Sharp...", Sharp approached Robert Kite, who is listed as lord mayor for only 1766. Can you reconcile those date discrepancies? (I do see that the Hochschild ref mentions the event as 2 years later from 1765, so there is some inconsistency in the reference material too.)

Further information: Official supplementary guidelines and unofficial guide  Warning: You are not logged in. Please create an account or log in to proceed. Alternatively, you may leave a message at the bottom of the DYK project talk page with the article you would like to nominate and the hook you would like to propose.  Warning: The helper script only works on desktop. Please switch to desktop view to continue. Install the DYK helper script by adding the line {{subst:lusc|User:SD0001/DYK-helper.js}} to your common.js page. Go back to the article, and choose the "DYK" option from the "More" menu (see image). Fill in the form and submit it. Check back periodically to address comments or concerns from the reviewer (it may take several weeks). Manual instructions[edit] Create a subpage for your new DYK suggestion and then list the page below under the date the article was created or the expansion began or it became a good article (not the date you submit it here), with the newest dates at the bottom. Any registered user may nominate a DYK suggestion (if you are not a registered user, please leave a message at the bottom of the DYK project talk page with the details of the article you would like to nominate and the hook you would like to propose); self-nominations are permitted and encouraged. Thanks for participating and please remember to check back for comments on your nomination (consider watchlisting your nomination page). Read these instructions completely before proceeding. For simplified instructions, see User:Rjanag/Quick DYK 2. I. Create the nomination subpage. Enter the article title in the box below and click the button. (To nominate multiple articles together, enter any or all of the article titles.) You will then be taken to a preloaded nomination page. II. Write the nomination. On the nomination page, fill in the relevant information. See Template:NewDYKnomination and {{NewDYKnomination/guide}} for further information. Not every line of the template needs to be filled in. For instance, if you are not nominating an image to appear with your hook, there is no need to fill in the image-related lines. Add an edit summary e.g. "Nominating YOUR ARTICLE TITLE for DYK" and click Publish page. Make sure the nomination page is on your watchlist, so you can follow the review discussion. III. Post at Template talk:Did you know. In the current nominations section find the subsection for the date on which the article was created or on which expansion began (or, if a new Good Article, the date on which it became a GA), not the date on which you make the nomination. At the top of that subsection (before other nominations already there, but below the section head and hidden comment) add {{Did you know nominations/YOUR ARTICLE TITLE}}. Add an edit summary e.g. "Nominating YOUR ARTICLE TITLE for DYK" and click Publish page. Frequently asked questions[edit] How do I write an interesting hook? Successful hooks tend to have several traits. Most importantly, they share a surprising or intriguing fact. They give readers enough context to understand the hook, but leave enough out to make them want to learn more. They are written for a general audience who has no prior knowledge of or interest in the topic area. Lastly, they are concise, and do not attempt to cover multiple facts or present information about the subject beyond what's needed to understand the hook. When will my nomination be reviewed? This page is often backlogged. As long as your submission is still on the page, it will stay there until an editor reviews it. Since editors are encouraged to review the oldest submissions first, it may take several weeks until your submission is reviewed. In the meantime, please consider reviewing another submission (not your own) to help reduce the backlog (see instructions below). Where is my hook? If you can't find the nomination you submitted to this nominations page, it may have been approved and is on the approved nominations page waiting to be promoted. It could also have been added to one of the prep areas, promoted from prep to a queue, or is on the main page. If the nominated hook is in none of those places, then the nomination has probably been rejected. Such a rejection usually only occurs if it was at least a couple of weeks old and had unresolved issues for which any discussion had gone stale. If you think your nomination was unfairly rejected, you can query this on the DYK discussion page, but as a general rule such nominations will only be restored in exceptional circumstances. Instructions for reviewers[edit] Main page: Wikipedia:Did you know/Reviewing guide Any editor who was not involved in writing/expanding or nominating an article may review it by checking to see that the article meets all the DYK criteria (long enough, new enough, no serious editorial or content issues) and the hook is cited. Editors may also alter the suggested hook to improve it, suggest new hooks, or even lend a hand and make edits to the article to which the hook applies so that the hook is supported and accurate. For a more detailed discussion of the DYK rules and review process see the supplementary guidelines and the WP:Did you know/Reviewing guide. To post a comment or review on a DYK nomination, follow the steps outlined below: Look through this page, Template talk:Did you know, to find a nomination you would like to comment on. Click the "Review or comment" link at the top of the nomination. You will be taken to the nomination subpage. The top of the page includes a list of the DYK criteria. Check the article to ensure it meets all the relevant criteria. To indicate the result of the review (i.e., whether the nomination passes, fails, or needs some minor changes), leave a signed comment on the page. Please begin with one of the 5 review symbols that appear at the top of the edit screen, and then indicate all aspects of the article that you have reviewed; your comment should look something like the following: Article length and age are fine, no copyvio or plagiarism concerns, reliable sources are used. But the hook needs to be shortened. If you are the first person to comment on the nomination, there will be a line :* <!-- REPLACE THIS LINE TO WRITE FIRST COMMENT, KEEPING  :* --> showing you where you should put the comment. Save the page. If there is any problem or concern about a nomination, please consider notifying the nominator by placing {{subst:DYKproblem|Article|header=yes|sig=yes}} on the nominator's talk page. Instructions for project members[edit] How to promote an accepted hook[edit] At-a-glance instructions on how to promote an approved hook to a Prep area See Wikipedia:Did you know/Preparation areas for details on verifying a hook's acceptability. Promoters should not promote their own nomination or their own review When promoting hooks intended for a particular date, keep in mind that when the number of available approved nominations exceeds 120 we switch to two sets per day, and when that number drops below 60 we return to one set per day. Check list for nomination review completeness 1) Select a hook from the approved nominations page that has one of these ticks at the bottom post: . 2) Check to make sure basic review requirements were completed. a. Any outstanding issue following needs to be addressed before promoting. 3) Check the article history for any substantive changes since it was nominated or reviewed. 4) Images for the lead slot must be freely licensed. Fair-use images are not permitted. Images loaded on Commons that appear on the Main Page are automatically protected by KrinkleBot. 5) Hook must be stated in both the article and source (which must be cited at the end of the article sentence where stated). 6) Hook should make sense grammatically. 7) Try to vary subject matters within each prep area. 8) Try to select a funny, quirky or otherwise upbeat hook for the last or bottom hook in the set. Steps to add a hook to prep In one tab, open the nomination page of the hook you want to promote. In a second tab, open the prep set you intend to add the hook to. 1) For hooks held for specific dates, refer to "Local update times" section on DYK Queue. a. Completed Prep area number sets will be promoted by an administrator to corresponding Queue number. 2) Copy and paste the hook into a chosen slot. a. Make sure there's a space between ... and that, and a ? at the end. b. Check that there's a bold link to the article. 3) If it's the lead (first) hook, paste the image where indicated at the top of the template. 4) Copy and paste ALL the credit information (the {{DYKmake}} and {{DYKnom}} templates) at the bottom 5) Check your work in the prep's Preview mode. a. At the bottom under "Credits", to the right of each article should have the link "View nom subpage" ; if not, a subpage parameter will need to be added to the DYKmake. 6) Save the Prep page. Closing the DYK nomination page At the upper left Change {{DYKsubpage to {{subst:DYKsubpage Change |passed= to |passed=yes At the bottom Just above the line containing }}<!--Please do not write below this line or remove this line. Place comments above this line.--> insert a new, separate line containing one of the following: To [[T:DYK/P1|Prep 1]] To [[T:DYK/P2|Prep 2]] To [[T:DYK/P3|Prep 3]] To [[T:DYK/P4|Prep 4]] To [[T:DYK/P5|Prep 5]] To [[T:DYK/P6|Prep 6]] To [[T:DYK/P7|Prep 7]] Also paste the same thing into the edit summary. Check in Preview mode. Make sure everything is against a pale blue background (nothing outside) and there are no stray characters, like }}, at the top or bottom. Save. For more information, please see T:TDYK#How to promote an accepted hook. Handy copy sources: To [[T:DYK/P1|Prep 1]] To [[T:DYK/P2|Prep 2]] To [[T:DYK/P3|Prep 3]] To [[T:DYK/P4|Prep 4]] To [[T:DYK/P5|Prep 5]] To [[T:DYK/P6|Prep 6]] To [[T:DYK/P7|Prep 7]] How to remove a rejected hook[edit] Open the DYK nomination subpage of the hook you would like to remove. (It's best to wait several days after a reviewer has rejected the hook, just in case someone contests or the article undergoes a large change.) In the window where the DYK nomination subpage is open, replace the line {{DYKsubpage with {{subst:DYKsubpage, and replace |passed= with |passed=no. Then save the page. This has the effect of wrapping up the discussion on the DYK nomination subpage in a blue archive box and stating that the nomination was unsuccessful, as well as adding the nomination to a category for archival purposes. How to remove a hook from the prep areas or queue[edit] Edit the prep area or queue where the hook is and remove the hook and the credits associated with it. Go to the hook's nomination subpage (there should have been a link to it in the credits section). View the edit history for that page Go back to the last version before the edit where the hook was promoted, and revert to that version to make the nomination active again. Add a new icon on the nomination subpage to cancel the previous tick and leave a comment after it explaining that the hook was removed from the prep area or queue, and why, so that later reviewers are aware of this issue. Add a transclusion of the template back to this page so that reviewers can see it. It goes under the date that it was first created/expanded/listed as a GA. You may need to add back the day header for that date if it had been removed from this page. If you removed the hook from a queue, it is best to either replace it with another hook from one of the prep areas, or to leave a message at WT:DYK asking someone else to do so. How to move a nomination subpage to a new name[edit] Don't; it should not ever be necessary, and will break some links which will later need to be repaired. Even if you change the title of the article, you don't need to move the nomination page. Nominations[edit] Older nominations[edit] Articles created/expanded on September 2[edit] Articles created/expanded on September 27[edit] Roman campaigns in Germania (12 BC – AD 16) ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that the Romans won a series of campaigns against the Germanic tribes following the disaster at Teutoburg, but decided to leave Germany because its land was not considered valuable? Source: Wells (2003), The Battle That Stopped Rome, pp. 206–7 Improved to Good Article status by SpartaN (talk). Self-nominated at 03:34, 29 September 2021 (UTC). General eligibility: New Enough: Y Long Enough: Y Other problems: Y Policy compliance: Adequate sourcing: Y Neutral: Y Free of copyright violations, plagiarism, and close paraphrasing: Y Other problems: Y Hook eligibility: Cited: N - Source is offline but happy to AGF. However, in the article the statement “they considered German lands too poor for annexation” is sourced to p.204 of Wells. pp.206-7 referred to above is used to support that they that “it was too costly in economic and military resources” to go into in Germany. I guess either way the hook is sourced but could you clarify the exact sourcing of the hook. Interesting: Y QPQ: None required. Overall: Interesting thorough article, well-written with good quality sourcing. Earwig shows no issues. Just a minor query around the hook sourcing but otherwise will be good to go. DeCausa (talk) 08:23, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @DeCausa: I found the web link that (for me) shows a preview if you're able to see it: https://books.google.com/books?id=mc30CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA206&lpg=PA206 SpartaN (talk) 10:07, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @SpartaN: Thanks for providing the link. It’s prompted a couple of thoughts for me. Firstly, Wells doesn’t seem to be saying the reason for the withdrawal is definitively known (“… the reasons for these decisions must have lain…”) i.e he’s making an assumption, however well founded. The hook is more definite than Wells is. Secondly, Wells’ emphasis is on the strength of the resistance being behind the reason - the poor value of the territory makes it “not worth it” because of the strength of the resistance. That’s not quite the same as just saying the land wasn’t valuable. (I notice the text you used in the article on this reflects that effort/value ratio issue.) To fix both points would you be prepared to consider an ALT1 which after “…Teutoburg” continues something along the lines of “…likely decided to leave Germany because the military effort was out of proportion to the territory’s value?” although there may need to be some trimming to get it into the 200 character limit. DeCausa (talk) 11:12, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @SpartaN and DeCausa: It's been over a month since the last comments here, have there been any updates? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:31, 13 November 2021 (UTC) From my point of view I’m waiting for SpartaN’s reply to my last post here. But I notice they haven’t edited Wikipedia since then, over a month ago. So I’m not quite sure what can be done. DeCausa (talk) 08:17, 13 November 2021 (UTC) I see. Given that there's really only one issue holding the nomination back, would anyone be willing to adopt this in case SpartaN doesn't return? It would be a shame if the nomination failed at this point. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 06:35, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I’m not sure what exactly are the DYK rules on this but, subject to that, options could be (a) I propose an ALT1 hook and someone else signs it off; (b) someone else proposes an ALT1 hook and I sign it off; (c) if anyone disagrees with me on the original hook I’m happy to step away and they sign it off. DeCausa (talk) 11:04, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I've looked at the Wells source and concur that it is saying the withdrawal was more down to the ratio of effort required to potential reward, and have boldly tweaked the copy in the article to reflect this. For what it's worth, I think ALT1 works just fine. firefly ( t · c ) 11:16, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Ok. I’m just going to formalize the ALT1 and let someone else add the tick and sign off: ALT1:... that the Romans won a series of campaigns against the Germanic tribes after the disaster at Teutoburg but likely decided to leave Germany as the effort was out of proportion to the territory’s value? DeCausa (talk) 12:07, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Since the reviewer has proposed a new hook, another editor will be needed to sign this off. I'm not sure though if the section linking in the bold links is allowed, however. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:29, 15 November 2021 (UTC) sorry, I missed that. It’s not even necessary to link to a section of the article so I’ve taken it out of ALT1. DeCausa (talk) 08:21, 15 November 2021 (UTC) As this doesn’t seem to be moving I’m going to give ALT1 the tick as original reviewer. If the DYK regulars think this is out of process because I came up nwith ALT1 then happy for it to be reverted. DeCausa (talk) 22:46, 21 November 2021 (UTC) DeCausa, there is no rush to approve, and your approval of your own hook was indeed out of process. I have reverted SL93's promotion of the nomination to prep, and with any luck a new reviewer will be around soon enough to review your ALT1. (SL93, you're welcome to review it, but that means you cannot also promote it.) I've also struck the original hook due to the issues noted above. BlueMoonset (talk) 04:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) BlueMoonset Sorry for mixing up who approved it. SL93 (talk) 04:26, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I didn't notice the second sentence of the approval...not sure how that happened. Sorry, again. SL93 (talk) 04:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) DeCausa Reading through the article again, your ALT1 hook seems to be mostly verifed in the Aftermath section, but I'm not seeing any indication of it being "likely". SL93 (talk) 21:14, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, that’s true. Where that came from was, in the above discussion with SpartaN on the original hook, they cited Wells in support. Wells says, in relation to Tiberius’ decision to ‘give up’, that “The reason for these decisions must have lain in the Germans’ tough resistance”. I’ve taken that to mean Wells’ was inferring Tiberius’ reasoning without direct evidence (or certainty) of Tiberius’ actual reason. However, you’re right that the way the article is written is more certain. I’m ok striking the “likely” or, possibly it would be better to amend the final sentence of the first paragraph of the Aftermath section to be more reflectve of Wells. DeCausa (talk) 21:48, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I will leave this here for someone else to look at. It would be helpful if the nominator came back. SL93 (talk) 23:21, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Articles created/expanded on October 9[edit] Pankratius Pfeiffer ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that Salvatorian priest Pankratius Pfeiffer saved hundreds of Jews in Rome during the Second World War? Reviewed: 1936 Northeast Flood Created by Ergo Sum (talk). Self-nominated at 17:52, 9 October 2021 (UTC). New article that was created on 9 October 2021? is 3,212 characters and nominated on the same day. No copyvios detected and duplication detector of [1][2][3][4][5] reveal no close paraphrasing issues (AGF PDF docs which can't go through Dup detector). Article is well-sourced. Hook is 103 characters long (under 200 character max.) and is interesting. Refs 4 and 5 (verifying the hook) are reliable sources. QPQ done. Looks good to go! —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:41, 9 October 2021 (UTC) Too many red flags here. If he really saved hundreds of Jews, you would expect plenty of confirmation of this in scholarly sources and him to be recognized by Yad Vashem. I can't count the number of times that I've seen mainstream newspapers print completely false stories about Jews being rescued during the holocaust, so better sources are definitely needed to confirm these extraordinary claims. Thanks Brigade Piron for letting me know about this. (t · c) buidhe 16:51, 10 October 2021 (UTC) I have to admit I'm just a bit perplexed by the argument. Except in fairly uncommon cases of multiple RS that contradict each other, we don't generally recognize any "hierarchy" of reliable sources. Sources are either RS or they are not. So I'm not sure what kind of sources you have in mind as "better" sources. The ones currently cited in the article are all RS, so that should be the end of it. I might add that if you seek some manner of official imprimatur in the vein of Yad Vashem, the City of Rome named a street after him. Your point about why there isn't more extensive coverage of this historical figure is well taken but can easily be attributed to the fact that all manner of historical figures are lost to history, especially those who are notable really for one major event in their life that did not come to light until years later, as is the case here. Indeed, one of the RS in this article describes Pfeiffer as being "lost to history." I'm adding the new review icon here so that we can get at least one more editor's evaluation of this. Ergo Sum 13:32, 16 October 2021 (UTC) There are very few people who actually saved hundreds of Jews during the Holocaust and plenty of hoaxes that were reported as truth by various news organizations—for example Necdet Kent. In other cases, actual rescue did occur but the numbers are greatly exaggerated and repeated uncritically by news organizations, such as Raoul Wallenberg. If the story is true you would expect to see it covered in many more credible sources. There are plenty of cases where a source is reliable for some info but not others. For example, someone's CV is often reliable for "they worked at X organization" but not "they are a world expert in Z". Extraordinary claims require extraordinary sourcing. (t · c) buidhe 21:27, 16 October 2021 (UTC) I should say that I share Buidhe's concerns. I think saying that "all manner of historical figures are lost to history" rather side-steps the sheer volume of historical scholarship on all aspects of the Holocaust. On a more banal note, I think part of the problem is that the sources cited are, essentially, all journalistic sources published by explicitly Catholic or Salvatorian outlets. The specific sources cited for the "saved" claim are Romereports (I am not familiar with this outlet, but the typo in the video does not inspire confidence) and a self-published Salvatorian newsletter. Neither are scholarly sources and both are, again, explicitly confessional in nature. I think WP:BIASED may on point in a highly sensitive issue touching on the wider disputes about Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust. Do we know what the Samerski book says, for example? —Brigade Piron (talk) 08:55, 17 October 2021 (UTC) Buidhe It is true that the sources cover Catholic issues, but only the Salvatorian one is actually published by a Catholic institution. I need not go into how varied Catholic newspapers are in their adherence/faithfulness to the Catholic hierarchy and beliefs (see e.g. National Catholic Reporter versus National Catholic Register). But more direclty, there actually are many scholarly RS that discussion Pfeiffer and his works in Nazi-occupied Rome. You will find them on the other language versions of this article. The problem is that I do not read Italian or German well enough to use them in the article. Coverage is not the issue. It is English language coverage. Ergo Sum 13:48, 17 October 2021 (UTC) @Ergo Sum: perhaps add the word "reportedly" before "saved". I'm inclined to accept in good faith the sources used as reliable – none of them have not been deprecated nor deemed generally unreliable. —Bloom6132 (talk) 16:41, 26 October 2021 (UTC) DYK should not cover unconfirmed reports or rumors so I strongly disagree with that suggestion. As well as assuming sources are reliable if they've never been discussed at WP:RSN, which disregards important parts of WP:RS such as WP:CONTEXTMATTERS. There is no issue with citing sources in Italian or German, but if it's not confirmed that they support the content then it's incorrect to assume that they do. (t · c) buidhe 20:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Bloom6132: I tend to think that statements are either supported by RS and written in wikivoice or they're not accepted at all. For that reason, I shy away from words like "reportedly." I reiterate though that I think it's quite clear there's nothing wrong with the sources currently used. They're all RS, so that should be the end of it. Hence, why I think your initial review was satisfactory. Ergo Sum 23:40, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Ergo Sum: agreed. I'm still of the view that the hook satisfies criteria 3b. Criteria 4 states that "Nominations should be rejected if an inspection reveals that they are not based on reliable sources". That is not the case here. —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) You're still ignoring the principle in RS that context matters, and some sources are reliable for some but not other info. The two of us who actually write on Holocaust related topics have expressed that the sources cited are not reliable for the exceptional claims being made. (t · c) buidhe 23:59, 26 October 2021 (UTC) With all due respect, I am of the opinion that the sources used are reliable for the info in the hook. The fact that you and Brigade Piron write on Holocaust-related topics is irrelevant – it does not confer a veto over hooks pertaining to that subject. By that logic, I should be able to veto baseball or heraldry hooks ... —Bloom6132 (talk) 01:10, 27 October 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: Three of my DYKs promoted (including Coat of arms of the Falkland Islands from August this year) have included the word "reportedly" in the hook, as well as numerous hooks from other editors. Disagree all you want – this is accepted practice at DYK. —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: I'm aware that you have experience writing about Holocaust-related articles and I put value in your assessment as a solid editor. However, I'm quite comfortable in my ability to vet RS, as well, and my confidence in these sources means I must disagree with your opinion here. Experienced editors do disagree at times, and it is my opinion that I think you have gotten this one wrong; doubtless, you think the same for me. I haven't seen any evidence that these are not RS. Therefore, I recommend if Bloom6132 is inclined to do so, to renew their approval of the hook. In the meantime, I'm going to request the input of additional experienced editors on the DYK talk page. Ergo Sum 01:28, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm going to ping @Bamse, Bermicourt, Jmabel, and Anyfile to see if we can find some reliable sources in other languages. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 01:46, 27 October 2021 (UTC) Oops, @AnyFile theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 01:47, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm currently traveling & very busy, so not much help here, I'm afraid. - Jmabel | Talk 01:53, 27 October 2021 (UTC) That said, more or less this same case is made in The Pope's Jews: The Vatican's Secret Plan to Save Jews from the Nazis by Gordon Thomas (not currently cited in the article). - Jmabel | Talk 02:00, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm unclear as to why the cited sources are unreliable: are we assuming that all information emanating from a Roman Catholic source is unreliable? If so what's the logic? In any case there are dozens of book sources in English, German, French and Italian that mention Pfeiffer, the problem is that few are accessible online. One is an entire biography of Pfeiffer "from baker to Vatican diplomat" which would be useful to track down: Willer, Philomena (2005). P. Pankratius Pfeiffer SDS: (1872-1945); vom Bäckergesellen zum Vatikandiplomat. Pub: Josef Fink. Others that mentions Pfeiffer and the Jews in Rome are: Liebhart (1996) Schwangau. Meding (1992), Flucht vor Nürnberg. Sinn (1976), Illegal. Bermicourt (talk) 08:41, 27 October 2021 (UTC) My issue is with the unreliability of journalistic works and popular history, which have in many cases published inaccurate information about rescues of Jews during the Holocaust. If better sources exist, they should be cited instead. An additional question is, do these sources actually support the claim of "hundreds" of Jews rescued by Pfeiffer personally? (t · c) buidhe 08:51, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I've now found sources that cover most of the article. Here are more: Liebhart (1996) Schwangau. Meding (1992), Flucht vor Nürnberg. Sinn (1976), Illegal. Prince Constantine of Bavaria (1952) Der Papst. Layer (1985), Schwäbisches Ehrenbuch - Pfeiffer credited with "saving Rome and other Italian cities including Chieti, Ascoli and Ovieto from destruction and other calamities" _ (1999). Publik-Forum - Pfeiffer the only German to have a street named after him in Rome and who fought to save Roman Jews. _ (1960). Bayerische Frömmigkeit - Pfeiffer described as the "Saviour of Rome and other cities in Italy" Robert Katz has written a number of books - Death in Rome (1967), Black Sabbath (1969), The Battle for Rome (2010) - which all mention Pfeiffer. Bottum and Dalin (2004). The Pius War has this interesting piece: "7. Pancrazio [sic] Pfeiffer. According to Carroll-Abbing, one of the men used by Pius XII to protest the Nazi roundup of Rome's Jews and intervene for persecuted victims was Father Pancrazio Pfeiffer, superior general of the Salvatorian Fathers, who also served as Pius XII' personal liaison to the German military command in Rome. Because Pfeiffer died tragically in an automobile accident toward the end of the war and thus never took part in the postwar analysis of Pius XII's conduct, many historians have overlooked him. But those who knew him or have researched his life have chronicled his collaborative efforts with Pius XII to rescue Jews and others during the war. See the article "Pfeiffer's List" by Robert Graham, 30 Days, June 1994, pp. 42-46. Prince Constantine of Bavaria's book on Pius XII, The Pope (London: Allan Wingate, 1954) [listed above] contains an excellent section on Pfeiffer, whom he describes as an agent for the pope on behalf of the victims of persecution and the fugitives in hiding" (p. 213). At Pfeiffer's death in May 1945, Vatican Radio paid tribute: "He came into contact with the Commander of the German occupying forces [in Rome in 1943-44]. From that day onwards, he placed his religious and spiritual qualities at the service of many who had been arrested or already condemned to death. He helped countless people in this way, and saved their lives, among them many Jews and other Italian personages. He championed..." In short there seems to be book evidence for virtually everything stated in the article apart from the specific details of the two incidents where 249 or 400 Jews were rescued. Based on my initial searches my expectation is that those incidents are likely to be recorded in the literature - we just need to be able to access more of the sources. Meanwhile there is no harm in pausing to use some of the above sources, plus those I've added to the Further reading section of the article in order to reinforce the existing references and then review where we are.

For example, Salvatorians USA Province is not independent of the article subject and therefore is not reliable for self-serving assertions such as "he saved many Jews in Rome from persecution and ultimately death" or "Every day, Pfeiffer visited the Regina Coeli prison and another prison on Via Tasso, where he would often return with freed prisoners who had been sentenced to death." (t · c) buidhe 08:27, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: would you still object if the article instead relied on the sources found by Bermicourt? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 04:58, 5 November 2021 (UTC) Depends, the Samerski source looks reliable to me but the book published by "Österreichische Provinz der Salvatorianer" has the same issue of close connection to the article subject. (t · c) buidhe 06:27, 5 November 2021 (UTC) All right. @Ergo Sum: I'm not going to promote the nomination without consensus to move forward, so if you want to try and rework the article's sourcing to approval, that can work.

Ergo Sum 15:45, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I have added several inline citations to the article, which refer to sources that were (very helpfully) added by Bermicourt. These sources support several of the very specific claims in the article, as well as the general thrust of the article which is in dispute here, namely that Pfeiffer was a liaison and in that capacity saved many Jews and others from the Nazis. In light of these reliable sources supporting the general claims, I think any concern about the pre-existing ones describing some of his more specific actions is ameliorated. There is a trove of additional sources in the Further Reading section that additionally describe in much greater detail Pfeiffer's actions but they are either in a foreign language which I do not adequately read to make use of as citations or are offline. All being said, I think there is now ample sourcing to back up the article's claims. Ergo Sum 05:49, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks, Ergo Sum—@Buidhe:, if this sourcing is up to your standards, we can move ahead. If not, we're probably going back to WT:DYK and asking for more eyes. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 05:52, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Hi, I've flagged the specific content in the article that supports the hook as needing a better source. There are other active cleanup tags on the article as well. However, I think there's sufficient sourcing for a modified version of the hook without the words "hundreds of". (t · c) buidhe 06:06, 17 November 2021 (UTC) We could cite "countless" using the ref above instead of "hundreds of". Bermicourt (talk) 08:33, 17 November 2021 (UTC) According to the source it's what Vatican Radio said about him after his death. DYK is not for eulogies imo. (t · c) buidhe 08:37, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I'm not following—is the source unreliable because it's after his death? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 08:40, 17 November 2021 (UTC) No, it's because it's Catholic presumably... We could always add "according to Vatican Radio..." But better still, we just need to cite the exact text from one of the many non-Catholic book sources and the problem will be solved. Bermicourt (talk) 08:46, 17 November 2021 (UTC) And yet another source: O'Reilly (2001) in Forgotten Battles: Italy's War of Liberation 1943-45 states that "the Vatican was able to assist many of Rome's Jews and others sought by the Germans through Father Pancrazio Pfeiffer's intervention with the Germans... His work was recounted by Robert Graham who has written extensively on the Vatican's role in World War II." Bermicourt (talk) 09:01, 17 November 2021 (UTC) And another: Bartley (2016) in Catholics Confronting Hitler states that "Father Pancrace [sic] Pfeiffer, a German priest and the superior general of the Salvatorian Order, was the pope's liaison with the German military. Several hundred hostages, including some under sentence of death, owed their release to the efficacious intervention of Father Pfeiffer." I don't know why I'm doing this - you can look up the references yourselves instead of opining and speculating from the sidelines in the classic Wikipedia way. :) Bermicourt (talk) 09:08, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @Bermicourt: Since it seems you have access to several sources that I do not (probably just requires further digging), would you want to add them as inline citations with page numbers, especially to support the proposition regarding hundreds of people saved?

I'd be in favor instead of the hook being split into two separate proposals: one hook about the fact that she was an internet celebrity who grew up in a place without tap water, and a separate hook about her going viral for making hamburgers. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:23, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Full review needed, which can also address the issue of the borderline ALT1 hook. BlueMoonset (talk) 04:23, 5 November 2021 (UTC) As far as I can tell the article meets DYK requirements, and a QPQ has been done. Earwigs finds a close match with Coda Media, but that's only because it was the source for quotes in the article, and all of them are properly referenced. I find the first hook hard to believe given China's international standing, and in any case as brought up by Bowlhover may be inaccurate anyway. As for the second hook, as I mentioned before it's ineligible as it's exactly 200 characters long, and per WP:DYK hooks that are at or shorter than 200 characters may be rejected per reviewer's discretion. Both ALT0 and ALT1 have struck: I am repeating my earlier suggestion that ALT1 instead be split into two separate hooks. As this is a China-related article and there appear to be some political discussion in the article, I'd also like to ask for a second opinion from someone more knowledgeable about China-related articles if the article doesn't fall afoul of relevant guidelines. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 13:12, 6 November 2021 (UTC) From Wikipedia:Did you know#The hook: The hook should be concise: no more than about 200 characters (including spaces and the question mark, but not including the ..., the space immediately following the ..., or any (pictured)). While 200 is a hard limit, hooks near or at this limit may still be rejected at the discretion of reviewers and administrators. This tool can be used for counting words. The guideline says that "200 is a hard limit", so it is not true that the 200-character ALT1 hook is "ineligible" or "simply too long". No reason has been given for rejecting a 200-character hook "at the discretion of reviewers". Here are two additional hooks based on the suggestion: ALT2: ... that Dianxi Xiaoge, who grew up in a remote Yunnan mountain without running water, is an Internet celebrity with roughly 16 million subscribers on all her platforms? ALT3: ... Dianxi Xiaoge went viral in China and internationally after making hamburgers for her grandparents who had never eaten them before? Cunard (talk) 07:48, 7 November 2021 (UTC) Well for one thing, the original was very difficult to read and seemed to combine too many facts into one hook. Usually DYK prefers simpler hooks whenever possible. In any case, I think ALT3 is the best hook here and the nomination is otherwise good to go, I'd just like to hear a second opinion from another editor on the article tone given that I'm a bit uncomfortable doing a solo review here given the "Commentary" section delves into some political matters. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:36, 7 November 2021 (UTC) On second thought, I have some concerns regarding the length of the article. Isn't it rather detailed for an internet celebrity's page? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 11:10, 7 November 2021 (UTC) That the article is "rather detailed for an internet celebrity's page" should not be a concern. The sources provided substantial analysis of her and her work, and this article reflects those sources. Other detailed articles for Internet celebrities include PewDiePie and MrBeast. Cunard (talk) 11:18, 7 November 2021 (UTC) Pinging Gatoclass for his input, as he responded to a discussion I raised about this nomination over at WT:DYK. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:57, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I don't think we need Gatoclass to restate themself. Here's what they said at WT:DYK: The article doesn't use the phrase "one of only three Chinese influencers to gain international influence", so I'm not sure where you got that, but it does say she is one of only three "Chinese Internet celebrities who have reached international prominence", and the problem with that claim is that it's sourced to an article that is two years old and therefore not up-to-date. With regard to the overall length, I would agree that it is overly detailed and could use a trim. I'm not sure this is relevant to DYK however, as "overly detailed" is not one of our criteria. What I would say is that the level of detail does raise the chances of close paraphrasing so the article would need to be carefully checked for that. Anybody else with an opinion on this article?

Thriley (talk) 20:57, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @Thriley: I'll ping BlueMoonset here in case I'm wrong, but I'm going to say no, it isn't. My reasoning here is that if the hook were read as plaintext, without any bolding or linking, it would be read as pretty much only interesting as it concerns the plot. The hook should concern Smit's life; if it concerns her work as an actress, only stating her role and not anything about production doesn't make the hook out-of-universe. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 21:28, 17 November 2021 (UTC) theleekycauldron, I was taking a look at the ALT1 hook and its sources, and the second Biography sentence is basically copied from Esquire—the Google translate version, at any rate. That's a problem. Another problem is that the source doesn't actually say that she was working as a hotel receptionist when she got the call, just that it was "one of these jobs", referring back to the four in the previous sentence, none of which were hotel receptionist. The article also needs a bit of copyediting. I don't think that either of the plot-based hooks should be used, and as Drmies notes, "first film" is not accurate, since it's Cross the Line that's in the source, which appears to be her fifth film. We could only use "first feature film" if the previous four in her filmography were all short films (which would need to be clearly sourced). Perhaps an angle for the information in ALT1 would be to say she was working in whatever job it was when she was cast in Cross the Line, for which she was nominated as best new actress in the Goya Awards. BlueMoonset (talk) 02:31, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Here’s an article that states she was working as a receptionist two years before she was hired to work on Parallel Mothers:[6] Does it appear reliable? Thriley (talk) 05:38, 20 November 2021 (UTC) I don't see a reason to doubt the source. However, it isn't sufficient to support the "when she was called" hook claim, just that she was a hotel receptionist two years before the article was written (and possibly two years and a number of months, since you can't assume it's exactly two years). BlueMoonset (talk) 17:14, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Perhaps the hook should include all her various jobs before her Almodovar role? Thriley (talk) 01:47, 23 November 2021 (UTC) ALT3 “before starring in the Pedro Almodóvar film Parallel Mothers, Milena Smit worked as a model, waitress, shop assistant, babysitter, teleoperator, subway information assistant, and hotel receptionist?” El País Thriley (talk) 01:51, 23 November 2021 (UTC) That hook is 197 characters which puts it in discretionary territory. Given though that the hookiness here is that she did all of these non-acting jobs, I think in this case the length is justified since it hasn't reached the limit.

I do like the hooks and it's an intriguing subject for an article! I wanted to flag the following comments, in case they are helpful (please ignore if not!): I don't quite follow this sentence in the lead: "Moreover, it is still pointed out that the emendation Albruna agrees with the names of other Germanic wise women." Should "instriptions" (before the Drusus heading) be "inscriptions"? Should the names of scholars be wikilinked, where there is a page for the author (e.g. Simek)? What does mss mean, and could this be explained when it is first referenced? The second paragraph of the Aurinia section has two sentences starting with "However" in a row, which is a bit awkward to read.

To be expected, since they're cited almost 20 times each, and since the vast majority of the matches concern long quotes I'm willing to overlook it, but can we add more citations throughout the paragraphs? Particularly with "Conflict with Miles and Reynolds", there's four citations crammed at the end of the section. I think we should cite each after the corresponding sentences, especially where there's a direct quotation. Also for ALT0 we need a citation at the ends of the sentences for "Golden Boy" and "Whiz Kid". Otherwise nice read, and good use of sources.

Its long enough and new and lots of good refs - including the hook fact. It documents a notable woman from the 14th century and there were not many of those.

Nice addition. well done Victuallers (talk) 10:31, 6 November 2021 (UTC) Reopening this because I think the hook is misleading, as according to the source it was usual for women of the nobility, like Neville, to sign with their own names. Gatoclass (talk) 02:10, 19 November 2021 (UTC) @Gatoclass: I don't think most will know that, so maybe we go with ALT1 or some variation on it? We don't need to say it's unusual if we phrase it that way theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 02:14, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Theleekycauldron, the problem with both hooks is that they imply that there was something out-of-the-ordinary in a woman signing something in her own name in that era, whereas the source indicates that was normal practice for women of the nobility. So the hooks are misleading. Gatoclass (talk) 02:19, 19 November 2021 (UTC) All right—I'll ping @Lajmmoore and Victuallers: back here, y'all can work this out. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 02:33, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Was it usual for women in the fourteenth century to sign with their own name ... no. Is is usual for women in the 21st century to sign with just their first name? No. So "did you know that unusually Canada's head of state signs documents with just her first name and an R for Regina?" (Someone shouts) "BUT all British Queens do that!!" (Someone shouts) "That implies that it was unusual for Queens to sign with just their first name." No it doesnt. I think @Gatoclass: is reading the source and then saying that the hook doesnt explain every piece of information in the source... which obviously it doesnt. Its unusual that "a woman" is doing this at all. It WAS unusual for women in the fourteenth century to sign and if they did then they did not usually use just their own name. Its a fact - its unusual. Did You know that women did not sign their own names on documents in the 14th century? No I didnt. That is something that Lajmmoore wrote about and now I know. Thanks. Victuallers (talk) 08:28, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Hello Gatoclass all so the part of the source I was using is this, which is talking about signatures for charitable donation "Although most of the widows declare themselves to be the wife of their late husband, or their father's daughter, others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names, such as 'domina Margareta de Longvl' and 'don-ýina Margareta de Nevill' (the same person). The majority of widows declare that their marital status and their power to act, using a variety of phrases, including 'in pura viduitate', 'in pura viduitate mea et ligia potestate', and 'in viduitate mea propria et potestate legitima' ..." and I read that as it was more usual for (noble) women to use a signature that described them as "wife of, etc..." I read the passage as Legg using Margaret de Neville as an unusual example. Legg is talking about the Coucher Book signatures specifically, but I still think they are marking out unusual practice. In terms of the hook, I wonder whether changing 'woman' to 'literate woman' might work? Lajmmoore (talk) 09:32, 19 November 2021 (UTC) No, it wouldn't work just to add "literate". And your reading of the text just amounts to an unsupported assumption on your part. Because while the text could admittedly be less ambiguous, the statement that others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names does not in any way suggest that it was rare or unusual for a member of the nobility to give their name, it only states that members of the nobility as a class were inclined to give their names. So there isn't sufficient support in that statement for a hook which implies that Neville's act was in any way unusual for a member of her class. The hook makes Neville sound like some sort of proto-feminist who boldly challenged the system, when the underlying source only indicates that either her entire class did the same thing, or at least that it was an accepted practice for members of the nobility. So I still think that either the hook needs to be substantially reworked to more closely reflect the source, or a new hook be found. Gatoclass (talk) 02:53, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks for sharing your interpretation of your text Gatoclass. My interpretation (& so the hook) is based on Legg's use of the word most - in that "most of the widows declare themselves to be the wife of their late husband, or their father's daughter" and you rightly point out "others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names" but I think that needs to be balanced by the "most" earlier in the sentence i.e. for women generally, they don't give their name, but some noble women do but overall, for women signing their name, it is unusual enough to be pointed out in the text.

Whispyhistory (talk) 04:04, 13 November 2021 (UTC) @Whispyhistory: But that would be impossible, the article can't possibly mention IP addresses, it's about broken toes.

It's okay with me if allowed (dyk says hook needs to be in article and in the following ref). Whispyhistory (talk) 06:32, 13 November 2021 (UTC) I don't see that exact sequence of numbers in the source, although there are others that look a bit like an IP address. The trouble is, the nominator seems to be the source for it looking a bit like an IP address, which it does, but we can't use that unless the source makes a similar point, which it does not appear to do. Something like this might work (numbers might need to be changed as mentioned): ALT1 ... that a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone may be described as 88.5.3.2? Philafrenzy (talk) 10:16, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Regarding the image, it's a fun idea but I don't think we run images as quizzes and the image is simply a skeletal foot, and not closely enough related to the hook.

I don't see how the hook you're suggesting is hooky. What exactly is wrong with the hook proposed? It's in the article and it's supported by the sources cited. And the image is directly related to the hook. It engages the reader into a spotting game. Dr. Vogel (talk) 14:57, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Like everyone else, I rather like the IP-address hook. If we wikilinked IP address, it would be supported in the linked articles, and fulfill the requirement that anyone following the links will be able to verify the hook. I don't think we need sourcing that says that a specific sequence of numbers is an IP address, as we have sources giving the general format of an IP address, and creating an example would be a trivial calculation ("Are all four of these numbers separated by periods in the range 0-255?"): "IPv4 and IPv6 address formats". www.ibm.com. An IPv4 address has the following format: x . x . x . x where x is called an octet and must be a decimal value between 0 and 255. Octets are separated by periods. An IPv4 address must contain three periods and four octets. The following examples are valid IPv4 addresses: 1 . 2 . 3 . 4 01 . 102 . 103 . 104 This hook is better than any alternative I can think of, and I don't see anything likely to be problematic about it (it's certainly verifiable). I think we might be in agreement on that? So if some rule technically prohibits it, we might have a good case for applying the WP:Ignore all the rules policy. Broken finger is also currently DYK-eligible and I think it uses the same numbering scheme.[1] HLHJ (talk) 02:07, 14 November 2021 (UTC) [edit: add fulltext url] I don't necessarily agree with the reading of WP:DYKCRIT 3b ( Each fact in the hook must be supported in the article by at least one inline citation to a reliable source [...]) that says that the IP thing needs to be in the article (compare e.g. Template:Did you know nominations/Urine deflector, which similarly took some creative licence in how the proposed hooks were phrased beyond what was stated in either the article or the cited source), and I agree with HLHJ that WP:IAR would be applicable regardless. As for the hooks themselves, writing "a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone may be described as 88.5.3.2" is a much poorer way of writing the hook (less "hooky") than the converse, i.e. "88.5.3.2 may refer to a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone". TompaDompa (talk) 11:28, 14 November 2021 (UTC) This. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 17:01, 16 November 2021 (UTC) We can't use IP address because the nominator just thought it up "oh, that looks like an IP address". It's not in the source as the nominator admits and therefore is not verifiable. And so what if it does look like an IP address? What does that tell us about broken toes? I like clever or quirky hooks and have written many (if I may say so), but they have to be based on something in the sources otherwise it's things made up one day. Philafrenzy (talk) 10:19, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you for all your comments. This is not the place to ignore all rules. The proposed hook is not supported by the source given in the article. I am inclined to approve ALT1 but it needs checking, unless another hook is proposed. Whispyhistory (talk) 15:11, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Oh dear, this has become contentious. I think the contended question is whether it's acceptable to have verified information not found in the nominated article, but only in another article, linked in the hook. Not as hooky, but for illustration: ALT3 ... that the dot-decimal notation string "88.5.3.2" is not only an an IPv4 address, but also a fracture in the middle of the bone at the tip of the little toe? "IPv4 and IPv6 address formats". www.ibm.com., Hallux proximal phalanx fracture in adults: an overlooked diagnosis I don't think we're debating whether the IP-address-hook statement is verifiable. The statement that "88.5.3.2" (and any number in that format) is a valid IPv4 address is supported by the IP address article and the IPv4 article, and this format is the subject of the Dot-decimal notation article. No-one had bothered to cite those statements in those articles, but since they've been challenged here, I've now cited them. So "88.5.3.2 is both an IP address[1] and a code for a broken toebone[2]" is certainly verifiable, and is now verified on Wikipedia. Any DYK reader should have no trouble verifying that the hook is accurate. Alternatives that do not mention IP addressees are not as hooky, but don't contain more information about broken toes: ALT4 ... that "88.5.3.2" is a toe fracture in the middle of the bone at the tip of the little toe, while a "78.5.3.2" is the parallel broken finger?

Philafrenzy (talk) 19:25, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you Philafrenzy ( a very experienced DYK contributor) for your efforts in helping new editors understand DYK. Your comment higher up about "88.5.3.2" and "ip address" not being in the source is true and I am grateful for your suggested alts. Essentially, the initial and subsequent hooks sound good, but none are in the article or the source. I don't wish for personal comments and don't mind if someone else wishes to take over here. With due respect @DrVogel: and @HLHJ:...You may wish to take this up at Wikipedia talk:Did you know. Whispyhistory (talk) 10:41, 15 November 2021 (UTC) I won't say I wish I hadn't written the article; I hope it's useful enough to make up for the social harm to the project here. I don't think the hostility was intended by anyone; I suspect that it's felt partly due to the ease of mininterpretation in a text-only medium and partly due to human cognitive biases.[2] I certainly did, and do, not intend it. I spent a day's editing trying to resolve the conflict by finding references specifically saying that the two things were in notation X and adding that text to the article, but unfortunately non-inductive descriptions of the notations seem to have been considered so needless that an Internet RFC attempting to formalize them died of disinterest. I did find a source that explicitly defines the IPv4 format, and one that explicitly says that 88.1.2.2 is a specific fracture, and I've cited the latter in the article, but I don't think this helps. It is probably a bit unreasonable to expect a reviewer to do more than apply rules as best they can, and Wikipedia talk:Did you know might indeed be a better forum for a more detailed discussion. I don't really want to take part in one, though (nothing to do with this discussion, prior reasons). I posted because I felt responsible for the conflict and thought I might be able to help. My impression is that I made it worse; my apologies to everyone I've offended. HLHJ (talk) 03:41, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Nobody is offended, but if I may say so I think you are still missing the point. IP addresses have nothing to do with broken toes even if that notation may have a similarity. That's why the sources don't make the comparison and why the IP-based hooks are no good. Any of the other hooks might be fine (I haven't checked the numbers) just without the bit about IP addresses. The whole thing reminds me of unusually shaped vegetables where you may see a carrot shaped like a foot, people who see faces in clouds, and even apophenia. My personal observation that one thing looks a bit like another is not the basis for a hook unless reliable sources make the point too. Philafrenzy (talk) 09:09, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Folks, we are wasting a wonderful hook. Really. IP addresses have nothing to do with broken toes even if that notation may have a similarity and that is the whole point of making good hooks. They are supposed to be short, punchy, catchy, and likely to draw the readers in to wanting to read the article – as long as they don't misstate the article content. And one of the best recipes to make a hook good is to make it sound counterintuitive With any other option but the original, we are bound to receive another hook frequented by maybe a few hundred visitors. I would propose something to the tune of in some contexts, 88.5.3.2 might not mean an IP address but a broken bone in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone? so that no one claims here that we somehow delegitimise the IP address but at the same time so that we preserve the core of the hook. As for the claims that because the hook is not cited in the IP part, it can't be there - please don't be that pedantic. In our today's world of informatics we may assume that people who visit Wikipedia more or less imagine what IP addresses are, and may more or less imagine how they look like (in the worst case they will visit the article for details). The other part is cited. I see no problem with the original. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 17:01, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Szmenderowiecki I admit that I'm not very familiar with the topic, and the above discussion was confusing, but is the "this isn't an IP address" claim actually in the source? Because if it's not, then no matter how good the hook proposal is, it can't be used in a hook since hook facts need to be based on a reference. Also, I'm pretty sure that assumptions don't count as sources. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:31, 17 November 2021 (UTC) What I was leading is that we don't need to cite that the sky is blue, or that we have five fingers; or that there exist IP addresses for that matter.

We're allowed to. This is not a massive occasion where we can save the whole project by breaking the rules. Its a trivial example of what some (not all) think may be a breach in the rules, with a small, but amusing, advantage. So I'm not asking the defenders of the rules to admit that this is not a breech ... I am suggesting that they might just concede that the harm done by allowing this hook might not offend anyone ... and it might please a few thousand. Victuallers (talk) 15:28, 20 November 2021 (UTC) We don't need to break the rules. The observation that the notation looks a bit like an IP address is trivial and completely unrelated to broken toes. There are already perfectly good hooks above that work better. Nobody is saying don't use the numbers, just strike the bit about IP addresses. The originally proposed hook is not the work of comic genius and cleverness that some seem to think it is. Philafrenzy (talk) 21:58, 20 November 2021 (UTC) The main issue here is that it's one of the core rules of DYK that hook facts must be mentioned in the article, ideally explicitly or at least implied by supporting information. The thing is that at the moment, IP addresses are not mentioned anywhere in the article, so the hooks using the IP address angle would be ineligible according to that criterion anyway. Even April Fools hooks, which tend to be misleading, are still generally based on hook facts that are mentioned in the respective articles. So if we can't even grant IAR exemptions for that criterion for AFD hooks, the one day of the year where our hooks tend to follow the rules most loosely, I can't see why such a request should be granted here.

Nominated by Victuallers (talk) at 16:21, 6 November 2021 (UTC). Article is new enough. Two correct writers are credited. The article is fully referenced. No copyvio detected. There is a bit of biased POV pushing in Wikipedia voice: "most vulnerable to climate change". This will be something our subject is saying no doubt. And this idea is also reflected in the hook with "endangered". The hook content is referenced and confirmed by the Guardian, apart from the "endangered" bit, which opinion is attributed to Tina Stege. So I suggest that "endangered" is taken out of the hook, or it is reworded so it is clear she is saying that. Hook alt1 is unsuitable as it does not link the article and I cannot tell what it is trying to say in relation to the subject. I can confirm image is CC-BY-3.0 as derived from the video with CC-BY-3.0 license. However I would suggest that a different image is selected from the video, perhaps near the end where the microphone is not obscuring her chin. QPQ is done. Graeme Bartlett (talk) 06:03, 15 November 2021 (UTC) @Graeme Bartlett: Thanks for the review Graeme - I have recut a new image. Surprised that "endangered" wasn't referenced. I'm not sure it is just her opinion -"Projected sea level rise would mean 40% of the buildings in the Marshall Islands’ capital of Majuro would be permanently flooded and entire islands would disappear, potentially costing the Pacific country its status as a nation, according to a devastating new report from the World Bank." is a quote from the reference I have added to balance the idea that "endangered" might by pov.

Graeme Bartlett (talk) 20:56, 22 November 2021 (UTC) @Graeme Bartlett: Are you suggesting that we imply that "endangered" is her opinion despite the fact that she represents a nation and the "endangered" aspect is supported by the World Bank and the Guardian newspaper (and the 1bn people estimated to be part of the "High Ambition" group ) saying so? Is there any evidence that is just her opinion and not that of her country and the World Bank? Am I missing something? It you feel you need to give this "a cross" then can I suggest that we ask for a new reviewer?I have suggested an alt that does not use the endangered word.

Self-nominated at 23:51, 4 November 2021 (UTC). @DferDaisy: This article is about 3300 bytes, and was nominated for DYK shortly after creation, satisfying date and length criteria. There is a factual error, as the article states she was interred in Keokuk, Illinois, but the source says she died in Chicago, Illinois and was interred in Keokuk, Iowa. I am assuming good faith for a few references I cannot access (for example, ref 15 - The National Humane Review), which for me gives a landing page for the document, instead of an inside view). Otherwise, everything is properly sourced and there are no copyvio or close paraphrasing concerns (Earwig cites 3 potential problems, but they are not an issue here.) QPQ not required. Regarding the hooks, ALT0 is incorrect as stated, as it reads as if the study was conducted in the early 1900s by Meigs Crowder, whereas she published it in 1917 based on studies from that period. It'll need minor alteration. ALT1 is fine and sourced. I would prefer to promote an amended ALT0. A minor quibble, though not an issue for DYK: please add page numbers for cited sources. If online access is eliminated from the sources, it'll force anyone investigating those sources to wade through too many pages to find the desired detail.

AleatoryPonderings (???) (!!!) 01:52, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @AleatoryPonderings: Yes, but note that this court case is the "leading case with respect to the issue of common employers", establishing a precedent in Canadian law. At the time the lawsuit was filed, this was not the case, and in fact the trial judge ruled against Alouche (see last paragraph of background section); it was only after the case was brought to the Court of Appeal for Ontario that the "common employer doctrine" was established, and it became entrenched when leave to appeal the decision at the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed. Mindmatrix 15:11, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Ah, so the idea behind the hook is that, since Downtown Eatery changed the law on common employers, before Downtown Eatery Best Beaver would not have been Alouche's employer? That makes more sense. AleatoryPonderings (???) (!!!) 15:20, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: I'm going to inspect this again... Mindmatrix 15:18, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @AleatoryPonderings: Alright, so to ensure everything is correct, the following timeline occurred: Alouche was hired to be manager at For Your Eyes Only (owned by Grad and Grosman), and began work on 29 December 1992 Alouche was sent a Notice of Discipline in May 1993, and was fired on 15 June 1993 In October 1993, Alouche filed action for wrongful dismissal against Best Beaver Management Inc., as that was the source of his paycheques Best Beaver ceased operations in mid-1996, and all assets distributed to other companies owned by Grad and Grosman The trial resolved in favour of Alouche Best Beaver did not pay out the judgement (all its assets had been redistributed) Sherriffs were dispatched to For Your Eyes Only, where they seized $1,855 Downtown Eatery filed claim against Alouche, stating the cash belonged to it Alouche defended, and counterclaimed against Grad, Grosman, and all companies they controlled on the grounds of common employer doctrine, the oppression remedy of the Ontario Business Corporations Act, and fraudulent conveyance the judge in the second trial (at Ontario Superior Court of Justice) ruled against Alouche the case was brought to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, where the previous ruling was overturned in 2001 in January 2002, an application for leave to appeal the decision at the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed So, the common employer doctrine was part of the second trial as a counterclaim to the suit filed by Downtown Eatery. I just wanted to ensure this satisfies your concerns. Mindmatrix 18:25, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks for this incredibly thorough response. My concern is maybe philosophical or definitional. If I say that company A employs person B, that has an ordinary meaning and a legal meaning. It is probably right that Best Beaver did not employ Alouche in the ordinary sense of "employ", because Best Beaver was a "paymaster" and not the name on the front of the building where he went to work. My reading of the case itself is that, before Downtown Eatery, it was at best indeterminate as a legal matter whether Best Beaver, alone or in combination with its affiliate companies, employed Alouche. After Downtown Eatery, it was established—as a matter of legal meaning, but not necessarily ordinary meaning—that Best Beaver was his employer, or part of his employer, or something like that. The reason I brought this up is that it's not clear how one could verify the claim that "Best Beaver was not Alouche's employer", because that claim might be true as a matter of ordinary meaning but the only authoritative legal ruling we have on this (namely, Downtown Eatery) holds that the claim is false. In any event, I'll leave this to the eventual reviewer to sort out. I find my brain twisting into knots. AleatoryPonderings (???)

However, it includes a WP:IMDB source and I am unsure about the reliability of several other sources, including Film Ink, Queer Media Matters, Antaeus.org, Fern TV, Addicted to Horror Movies, Dan's Papers, Go Mag, Three Women in a Box and North Coast Rep. To add to that, the YouTube link does not appear to be uploaded by an official channel, making it unreliable. Additionally, per MOS:FILMCAST uncredited roles need a source. the copyvio checker showed up a 50%+ similarity with a source, which may suggest over quotation. On top of that, the subject has unclear notability. I'm unsure which roles are significant and The House on Pine Street appears to have a questionable notability. None of her awards seem significant and I'm not seeing any significant coverage from reliable, independent sources. ALT0 isn't very interesting given the festival is not significant enough to have an article. I think ALT1 is interesting but it seems to focus more on the character, not the actress which isn't exactly ideal... QPQ not needed. We'll need some work but we'll get there!

Thanks, DanCherek. while the article is over 1,500 prose characters, I'm going to be a stickler and say that this is still a stub.

Moving on, the article was created from a redir and nominated in time and is neutral, although I'm requesting a second opinion on the sourcing. The article seems to be plagiarism free, and a QPQ has been done. As for the hook, I'm not sure it quite checks out—is the church expected to break away?

Once we clear those two up, we're good to go. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 02:41, 21 November 2021 (UTC) @Theleekycauldron: Not entirely sure what the concern on the sourcing is; there are multiple reputable sources.

Thanks! ~ Pbritti (talk) 05:10, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Isn't there a difference between "planned" (alt1) and "expected" (alt0)? planned implies it may or may not happen, expected is like forecasting—at least, that's how i read it. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 05:19, 21 November 2021 (UTC) @Theleekycauldron: Merriam-Webster considers them definitionally synonymous terms (see definition 2).

Maximilian Dood ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that in August 2021, YouTuber Maximilian Dood's viral social media campaign for Marvel vs. Capcom 2's rerelease caught the regards of studio Digital Eclipse, who expressed interest in rereleasing the game? Source: 1 and 2 Comment: This is the first time I’ve ever made a DYK here, so here goes. I personally find this fact interesting because it highlights how the advent of YouTube, and internet fame in general, has allowed people to use their voice to reach people in positions of high influence, bringing hidden ideas to light and advocating for change. While this specific example falls under a video game/pop-culture category, and may not fit Wikipedia’s desire for academic material, I feel that this is interesting enough to share, as it’s one the gaming community can relate to, like with other social media trends such as #FreeSmash and "Rerelease Mother 3." As for the article itself, all of the citations should be reliable enough; they’re all from third-party/secondary source outlets and there isn’t any BLP violation to be found here. One concern I have is criteria #3 - “Each fact in the hook must be supported in the article by at least one inline citation to a reliable source, appearing no later than the end of the sentence(s) offering that fact. Citations at the end of the paragraph are not sufficient.” While the hook is sourced in the article, the refs are at the end of the section rather than per each sentence. I can fix that however. Anyway, I hope this fact does get accepted! If not, I understand, thanks for reviewing this anyway. Created/expanded by PantheonRadiance (talk). Self-nominated at 08:45, 17 November 2021 (UTC).

Newness requirement satisfied by 5x expansion on 11/15 from < 600 to > 3000 characters. Articles also long enough and compliant with core policies on citations and neutrality. The hook is in-line sourced. Photo has appropriate license. QPQ is done. There are, however, two problems: (1) There is some significant overlap with this source. To start, the following sentence is taken from the source without use of quotation marks and with no effort to paraphrase rather than use the precise words: "Local advocacy led to the establishment of Bridle Trails as a state park in 1932." Further, this sentence also strikes me as too closely drawn from the same source: "Initial park development dates to 1933 when Civil Works Administration employees and federal relief workers were employed in state parks as part of the New Deal program. Further work included burning logging debris, clearing brush and building trails and fences." Work needs to be done to put the material into your own words. (2) The hook strikes me as boring in that it states an obvious point. Horses having the right of way on this trail is not unique or special. On trails that are shared by humans and horses, it is the general rule that horses have the right of way. See here ("In general, horses always have the right of way, followed by hikers, then by bikers."). See also here ("For safety reasons, if you come across a horse and rider on any trail they always have right of way. Hikers and bike riders all yield to horses.")

For one, the quote is not actually "could have been made by aliens" so, considering this is all about misquotation, we should either use the actual quote or clarify that it is a misquotation.

Graham87 09:41, 18 November 2021 (UTC) @Gerda Arendt: Thank you for the review. Diamonds were often cut in cabochon style in the 19th century and earlier. This one was cut with a flat bottom like all cabochons, and when viewed from above, it was a large oval, about 1.5 inches long. Modern cabochons usually have a smoothly rounded surface; this one was lightly faceted but the facets don't show on the sculpture. So it looks like half an egg, I suppose. The Koh-i-Noor is the large oval at the bottom of the picture. We have no specific citation for artistic licence - that is just a conclusion that we can probably make, since we have no evidence that Victoria ever had it set in a necklace. Therefore I cannot use "artistic licence" in a hook or in the article. I'll have a go at a hook using a full-length Victoria, and another hook using the Warrior and Wounded Youth sculpture. I'll come back shortly with those.

Self-nominated at 22:50, 16 November 2021 (UTC). @Ritchie333: Article is a new, plagiarism free, neutral, and well sourced not-stub (1633B). As for the hooks, I'm going to reject ALT0 out of hand, because Ben Comeau can take a number on that one. I'm also going to say no to ALT1, not because it's uncivil or uninteresting, but because it should be quoted—I've suggested two minor alts. A QPQ is also needed. Let me know what you think—nice work! — Preceding unsigned comment added by Theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) 02:57, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Re 1a, I don't see how we know that Comeau personally thinks of Trump; these could have been works-for-hire, after all. I've been trying to come up with something catchy on this -- for example, had Comeau invited Trump to participate in a performance of the work, then we could say he told Trump to fugue himself -- but the sourcing just isn't there that I can see. In consolation, here's an enlightening bit of musical history you will want to share with friends and family: Q: Why did Bach have so many children? Unhide for answer A: Because he didn't have any stops in his organ. In fact, he wore out three organs fuguing. Thanks may be left on my talk page. EEng 16:47, 17 November 2021 (UTC) The video for "Boris Johnson is a Lying Shit" includes a description from Comeau that basically screams for people not to vote for him, and the one for "Donald Trump is a Wanker" says "As satisfying as it is to poke fun at the Orange Monster, this video on its own probably won’t do the teeniest thing to reduce the devastation inflicted by the Trump administration. I therefore want to use this platform to suggest ways we can contribute to meaningful anti-Trump resistance.". We'd need to flesh out the article with these WP:BLPPRIMARY sources for the "thinks" to be properly verifiable.

There is over-linking in the hook. Copyvio seems fine (ignoring the 90% violation, which is a website which copies Wikipedia) QPQ not required.

Or that the Abendmusiken were actually presented right after Vespers?[3] Vespers, which themselves lasted two or three hours, in addition to a further three or four hour Hauptgottesdienst in the morning?[4][5] That might be one of the reasons why the audience was reported to be so disorderly, to the point that the town watch had to be hired to maintain a semblance of order.[6] That, and a lot more, which would surely allow to take this to DYK at a later time, after having greatly expanded this.

Fact is, I have the score and the whole text (including in translation) with me, in addition to lots of critical commentary on the piece itself (too much of which is focused on the question of authenticity, but alas...) and on the Abendmusiken in general. This can be used to make a proper article, but it would require time, which at the moment I really need to put into meeting an actual deadline than here. I've given you a list of pertinent sources (many of which are in German, if that's easier for you), if you're interested you know where to ask. On top of all of that, there's the question of article title (should it be at the current one or at Wacht! Euch zum Streit gefasset macht (a title which is used in a fair amount of sources, too...)

Overall: Article meets eligibility criteria. i.e newness and article length. Article is well sourced and is neutral in tone. Hook is interesting and is cited. Copyvio scores ~20% in major part due to a quote that has been attributed rightly. However, the nominator might want to consider removing the quote and rewriting the sentence because the original Nepal Times article does not have it as a quote and is likely a paraphrasing done by the newspaper to begin with. Hence, we should not include it as a quote. In addition, I would encourage the nominator to consider expanding the article - to be clear, the article is good to go as-is. But looking at Hanuman Dhoka for instance there is an opportunity to build this article more than just a "History" section. Handing it back to the nominator. Some work and this is ready for homepage. Good luck.

Further information: Official supplementary guidelines and unofficial guide  Warning: You are not logged in. Please create an account or log in to proceed. Alternatively, you may leave a message at the bottom of the DYK project talk page with the article you would like to nominate and the hook you would like to propose.  Warning: The helper script only works on desktop. Please switch to desktop view to continue. Install the DYK helper script by adding the line {{subst:lusc|User:SD0001/DYK-helper.js}} to your common.js page. Go back to the article, and choose the "DYK" option from the "More" menu (see image). Fill in the form and submit it. Check back periodically to address comments or concerns from the reviewer (it may take several weeks). Manual instructions[edit] Create a subpage for your new DYK suggestion and then list the page below under the date the article was created or the expansion began or it became a good article (not the date you submit it here), with the newest dates at the bottom. Any registered user may nominate a DYK suggestion (if you are not a registered user, please leave a message at the bottom of the DYK project talk page with the details of the article you would like to nominate and the hook you would like to propose); self-nominations are permitted and encouraged. Thanks for participating and please remember to check back for comments on your nomination (consider watchlisting your nomination page). Read these instructions completely before proceeding. For simplified instructions, see User:Rjanag/Quick DYK 2. I. Create the nomination subpage. Enter the article title in the box below and click the button. (To nominate multiple articles together, enter any or all of the article titles.) You will then be taken to a preloaded nomination page. II. Write the nomination. On the nomination page, fill in the relevant information. See Template:NewDYKnomination and {{NewDYKnomination/guide}} for further information. Not every line of the template needs to be filled in. For instance, if you are not nominating an image to appear with your hook, there is no need to fill in the image-related lines. Add an edit summary e.g. "Nominating YOUR ARTICLE TITLE for DYK" and click Publish page. Make sure the nomination page is on your watchlist, so you can follow the review discussion. III. Post at Template talk:Did you know. In the current nominations section find the subsection for the date on which the article was created or on which expansion began (or, if a new Good Article, the date on which it became a GA), not the date on which you make the nomination. At the top of that subsection (before other nominations already there, but below the section head and hidden comment) add {{Did you know nominations/YOUR ARTICLE TITLE}}. Add an edit summary e.g. "Nominating YOUR ARTICLE TITLE for DYK" and click Publish page. Frequently asked questions[edit] How do I write an interesting hook? Successful hooks tend to have several traits. Most importantly, they share a surprising or intriguing fact. They give readers enough context to understand the hook, but leave enough out to make them want to learn more. They are written for a general audience who has no prior knowledge of or interest in the topic area. Lastly, they are concise, and do not attempt to cover multiple facts or present information about the subject beyond what's needed to understand the hook. When will my nomination be reviewed? This page is often backlogged. As long as your submission is still on the page, it will stay there until an editor reviews it. Since editors are encouraged to review the oldest submissions first, it may take several weeks until your submission is reviewed. In the meantime, please consider reviewing another submission (not your own) to help reduce the backlog (see instructions below). Where is my hook? If you can't find the nomination you submitted to this nominations page, it may have been approved and is on the approved nominations page waiting to be promoted. It could also have been added to one of the prep areas, promoted from prep to a queue, or is on the main page. If the nominated hook is in none of those places, then the nomination has probably been rejected. Such a rejection usually only occurs if it was at least a couple of weeks old and had unresolved issues for which any discussion had gone stale. If you think your nomination was unfairly rejected, you can query this on the DYK discussion page, but as a general rule such nominations will only be restored in exceptional circumstances. Instructions for reviewers[edit] Main page: Wikipedia:Did you know/Reviewing guide Any editor who was not involved in writing/expanding or nominating an article may review it by checking to see that the article meets all the DYK criteria (long enough, new enough, no serious editorial or content issues) and the hook is cited. Editors may also alter the suggested hook to improve it, suggest new hooks, or even lend a hand and make edits to the article to which the hook applies so that the hook is supported and accurate. For a more detailed discussion of the DYK rules and review process see the supplementary guidelines and the WP:Did you know/Reviewing guide. To post a comment or review on a DYK nomination, follow the steps outlined below: Look through this page, Template talk:Did you know, to find a nomination you would like to comment on. Click the "Review or comment" link at the top of the nomination. You will be taken to the nomination subpage. The top of the page includes a list of the DYK criteria. Check the article to ensure it meets all the relevant criteria. To indicate the result of the review (i.e., whether the nomination passes, fails, or needs some minor changes), leave a signed comment on the page. Please begin with one of the 5 review symbols that appear at the top of the edit screen, and then indicate all aspects of the article that you have reviewed; your comment should look something like the following: Article length and age are fine, no copyvio or plagiarism concerns, reliable sources are used. But the hook needs to be shortened. If you are the first person to comment on the nomination, there will be a line :* <!-- REPLACE THIS LINE TO WRITE FIRST COMMENT, KEEPING  :* --> showing you where you should put the comment. Save the page. If there is any problem or concern about a nomination, please consider notifying the nominator by placing {{subst:DYKproblem|Article|header=yes|sig=yes}} on the nominator's talk page. Instructions for project members[edit] How to promote an accepted hook[edit] At-a-glance instructions on how to promote an approved hook to a Prep area See Wikipedia:Did you know/Preparation areas for details on verifying a hook's acceptability. Promoters should not promote their own nomination or their own review When promoting hooks intended for a particular date, keep in mind that when the number of available approved nominations exceeds 120 we switch to two sets per day, and when that number drops below 60 we return to one set per day. Check list for nomination review completeness 1) Select a hook from the approved nominations page that has one of these ticks at the bottom post: . 2) Check to make sure basic review requirements were completed. a. Any outstanding issue following needs to be addressed before promoting. 3) Check the article history for any substantive changes since it was nominated or reviewed. 4) Images for the lead slot must be freely licensed. Fair-use images are not permitted. Images loaded on Commons that appear on the Main Page are automatically protected by KrinkleBot. 5) Hook must be stated in both the article and source (which must be cited at the end of the article sentence where stated). 6) Hook should make sense grammatically. 7) Try to vary subject matters within each prep area. 8) Try to select a funny, quirky or otherwise upbeat hook for the last or bottom hook in the set. Steps to add a hook to prep In one tab, open the nomination page of the hook you want to promote. In a second tab, open the prep set you intend to add the hook to. 1) For hooks held for specific dates, refer to "Local update times" section on DYK Queue. a. Completed Prep area number sets will be promoted by an administrator to corresponding Queue number. 2) Copy and paste the hook into a chosen slot. a. Make sure there's a space between ... and that, and a ? at the end. b. Check that there's a bold link to the article. 3) If it's the lead (first) hook, paste the image where indicated at the top of the template. 4) Copy and paste ALL the credit information (the {{DYKmake}} and {{DYKnom}} templates) at the bottom 5) Check your work in the prep's Preview mode. a. At the bottom under "Credits", to the right of each article should have the link "View nom subpage" ; if not, a subpage parameter will need to be added to the DYKmake. 6) Save the Prep page. Closing the DYK nomination page At the upper left Change {{DYKsubpage to {{subst:DYKsubpage Change |passed= to |passed=yes At the bottom Just above the line containing }}<!--Please do not write below this line or remove this line. Place comments above this line.--> insert a new, separate line containing one of the following: To [[T:DYK/P1|Prep 1]] To [[T:DYK/P2|Prep 2]] To [[T:DYK/P3|Prep 3]] To [[T:DYK/P4|Prep 4]] To [[T:DYK/P5|Prep 5]] To [[T:DYK/P6|Prep 6]] To [[T:DYK/P7|Prep 7]] Also paste the same thing into the edit summary. Check in Preview mode. Make sure everything is against a pale blue background (nothing outside) and there are no stray characters, like }}, at the top or bottom. Save. For more information, please see T:TDYK#How to promote an accepted hook. Handy copy sources: To [[T:DYK/P1|Prep 1]] To [[T:DYK/P2|Prep 2]] To [[T:DYK/P3|Prep 3]] To [[T:DYK/P4|Prep 4]] To [[T:DYK/P5|Prep 5]] To [[T:DYK/P6|Prep 6]] To [[T:DYK/P7|Prep 7]] How to remove a rejected hook[edit] Open the DYK nomination subpage of the hook you would like to remove. (It's best to wait several days after a reviewer has rejected the hook, just in case someone contests or the article undergoes a large change.) In the window where the DYK nomination subpage is open, replace the line {{DYKsubpage with {{subst:DYKsubpage, and replace |passed= with |passed=no. Then save the page. This has the effect of wrapping up the discussion on the DYK nomination subpage in a blue archive box and stating that the nomination was unsuccessful, as well as adding the nomination to a category for archival purposes. How to remove a hook from the prep areas or queue[edit] Edit the prep area or queue where the hook is and remove the hook and the credits associated with it. Go to the hook's nomination subpage (there should have been a link to it in the credits section). View the edit history for that page Go back to the last version before the edit where the hook was promoted, and revert to that version to make the nomination active again. Add a new icon on the nomination subpage to cancel the previous tick and leave a comment after it explaining that the hook was removed from the prep area or queue, and why, so that later reviewers are aware of this issue. Add a transclusion of the template back to this page so that reviewers can see it. It goes under the date that it was first created/expanded/listed as a GA. You may need to add back the day header for that date if it had been removed from this page. If you removed the hook from a queue, it is best to either replace it with another hook from one of the prep areas, or to leave a message at WT:DYK asking someone else to do so. How to move a nomination subpage to a new name[edit] Don't; it should not ever be necessary, and will break some links which will later need to be repaired. Even if you change the title of the article, you don't need to move the nomination page. Nominations[edit] Older nominations[edit] Articles created/expanded on September 2[edit] Articles created/expanded on September 27[edit] Roman campaigns in Germania (12 BC – AD 16) ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that the Romans won a series of campaigns against the Germanic tribes following the disaster at Teutoburg, but decided to leave Germany because its land was not considered valuable? Source: Wells (2003), The Battle That Stopped Rome, pp. 206–7 Improved to Good Article status by SpartaN (talk). Self-nominated at 03:34, 29 September 2021 (UTC). General eligibility: New Enough: Y Long Enough: Y Other problems: Y Policy compliance: Adequate sourcing: Y Neutral: Y Free of copyright violations, plagiarism, and close paraphrasing: Y Other problems: Y Hook eligibility: Cited: N - Source is offline but happy to AGF. However, in the article the statement “they considered German lands too poor for annexation” is sourced to p.204 of Wells. pp.206-7 referred to above is used to support that they that “it was too costly in economic and military resources” to go into in Germany. I guess either way the hook is sourced but could you clarify the exact sourcing of the hook. Interesting: Y QPQ: None required. Overall: Interesting thorough article, well-written with good quality sourcing. Earwig shows no issues. Just a minor query around the hook sourcing but otherwise will be good to go. DeCausa (talk) 08:23, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @DeCausa: I found the web link that (for me) shows a preview if you're able to see it: https://books.google.com/books?id=mc30CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA206&lpg=PA206 SpartaN (talk) 10:07, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @SpartaN: Thanks for providing the link. It’s prompted a couple of thoughts for me. Firstly, Wells doesn’t seem to be saying the reason for the withdrawal is definitively known (“… the reasons for these decisions must have lain…”) i.e he’s making an assumption, however well founded. The hook is more definite than Wells is. Secondly, Wells’ emphasis is on the strength of the resistance being behind the reason - the poor value of the territory makes it “not worth it” because of the strength of the resistance. That’s not quite the same as just saying the land wasn’t valuable. (I notice the text you used in the article on this reflects that effort/value ratio issue.) To fix both points would you be prepared to consider an ALT1 which after “…Teutoburg” continues something along the lines of “…likely decided to leave Germany because the military effort was out of proportion to the territory’s value?” although there may need to be some trimming to get it into the 200 character limit. DeCausa (talk) 11:12, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @SpartaN and DeCausa: It's been over a month since the last comments here, have there been any updates? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:31, 13 November 2021 (UTC) From my point of view I’m waiting for SpartaN’s reply to my last post here. But I notice they haven’t edited Wikipedia since then, over a month ago. So I’m not quite sure what can be done. DeCausa (talk) 08:17, 13 November 2021 (UTC) I see. Given that there's really only one issue holding the nomination back, would anyone be willing to adopt this in case SpartaN doesn't return? It would be a shame if the nomination failed at this point. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 06:35, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I’m not sure what exactly are the DYK rules on this but, subject to that, options could be (a) I propose an ALT1 hook and someone else signs it off; (b) someone else proposes an ALT1 hook and I sign it off; (c) if anyone disagrees with me on the original hook I’m happy to step away and they sign it off. DeCausa (talk) 11:04, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I've looked at the Wells source and concur that it is saying the withdrawal was more down to the ratio of effort required to potential reward, and have boldly tweaked the copy in the article to reflect this. For what it's worth, I think ALT1 works just fine. firefly ( t · c ) 11:16, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Ok. I’m just going to formalize the ALT1 and let someone else add the tick and sign off: ALT1:... that the Romans won a series of campaigns against the Germanic tribes after the disaster at Teutoburg but likely decided to leave Germany as the effort was out of proportion to the territory’s value? DeCausa (talk) 12:07, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Since the reviewer has proposed a new hook, another editor will be needed to sign this off. I'm not sure though if the section linking in the bold links is allowed, however. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:29, 15 November 2021 (UTC) sorry, I missed that. It’s not even necessary to link to a section of the article so I’ve taken it out of ALT1. DeCausa (talk) 08:21, 15 November 2021 (UTC) As this doesn’t seem to be moving I’m going to give ALT1 the tick as original reviewer. If the DYK regulars think this is out of process because I came up nwith ALT1 then happy for it to be reverted. DeCausa (talk) 22:46, 21 November 2021 (UTC) DeCausa, there is no rush to approve, and your approval of your own hook was indeed out of process. I have reverted SL93's promotion of the nomination to prep, and with any luck a new reviewer will be around soon enough to review your ALT1. (SL93, you're welcome to review it, but that means you cannot also promote it.) I've also struck the original hook due to the issues noted above. BlueMoonset (talk) 04:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) BlueMoonset Sorry for mixing up who approved it. SL93 (talk) 04:26, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I didn't notice the second sentence of the approval...not sure how that happened. Sorry, again. SL93 (talk) 04:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) DeCausa Reading through the article again, your ALT1 hook seems to be mostly verifed in the Aftermath section, but I'm not seeing any indication of it being "likely". SL93 (talk) 21:14, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, that’s true. Where that came from was, in the above discussion with SpartaN on the original hook, they cited Wells in support. Wells says, in relation to Tiberius’ decision to ‘give up’, that “The reason for these decisions must have lain in the Germans’ tough resistance”. I’ve taken that to mean Wells’ was inferring Tiberius’ reasoning without direct evidence (or certainty) of Tiberius’ actual reason. However, you’re right that the way the article is written is more certain. I’m ok striking the “likely” or, possibly it would be better to amend the final sentence of the first paragraph of the Aftermath section to be more reflectve of Wells. DeCausa (talk) 21:48, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I will leave this here for someone else to look at. It would be helpful if the nominator came back. SL93 (talk) 23:21, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Articles created/expanded on October 9[edit] Pankratius Pfeiffer ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that Salvatorian priest Pankratius Pfeiffer saved hundreds of Jews in Rome during the Second World War? Reviewed: 1936 Northeast Flood Created by Ergo Sum (talk). Self-nominated at 17:52, 9 October 2021 (UTC). New article that was created on 9 October 2021? is 3,212 characters and nominated on the same day. No copyvios detected and duplication detector of [1][2][3][4][5] reveal no close paraphrasing issues (AGF PDF docs which can't go through Dup detector). Article is well-sourced. Hook is 103 characters long (under 200 character max.) and is interesting. Refs 4 and 5 (verifying the hook) are reliable sources. QPQ done. Looks good to go! —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:41, 9 October 2021 (UTC) Too many red flags here. If he really saved hundreds of Jews, you would expect plenty of confirmation of this in scholarly sources and him to be recognized by Yad Vashem. I can't count the number of times that I've seen mainstream newspapers print completely false stories about Jews being rescued during the holocaust, so better sources are definitely needed to confirm these extraordinary claims. Thanks Brigade Piron for letting me know about this. (t · c) buidhe 16:51, 10 October 2021 (UTC) I have to admit I'm just a bit perplexed by the argument. Except in fairly uncommon cases of multiple RS that contradict each other, we don't generally recognize any "hierarchy" of reliable sources. Sources are either RS or they are not. So I'm not sure what kind of sources you have in mind as "better" sources. The ones currently cited in the article are all RS, so that should be the end of it. I might add that if you seek some manner of official imprimatur in the vein of Yad Vashem, the City of Rome named a street after him. Your point about why there isn't more extensive coverage of this historical figure is well taken but can easily be attributed to the fact that all manner of historical figures are lost to history, especially those who are notable really for one major event in their life that did not come to light until years later, as is the case here. Indeed, one of the RS in this article describes Pfeiffer as being "lost to history." I'm adding the new review icon here so that we can get at least one more editor's evaluation of this. Ergo Sum 13:32, 16 October 2021 (UTC) There are very few people who actually saved hundreds of Jews during the Holocaust and plenty of hoaxes that were reported as truth by various news organizations—for example Necdet Kent. In other cases, actual rescue did occur but the numbers are greatly exaggerated and repeated uncritically by news organizations, such as Raoul Wallenberg. If the story is true you would expect to see it covered in many more credible sources. There are plenty of cases where a source is reliable for some info but not others. For example, someone's CV is often reliable for "they worked at X organization" but not "they are a world expert in Z". Extraordinary claims require extraordinary sourcing. (t · c) buidhe 21:27, 16 October 2021 (UTC) I should say that I share Buidhe's concerns. I think saying that "all manner of historical figures are lost to history" rather side-steps the sheer volume of historical scholarship on all aspects of the Holocaust. On a more banal note, I think part of the problem is that the sources cited are, essentially, all journalistic sources published by explicitly Catholic or Salvatorian outlets. The specific sources cited for the "saved" claim are Romereports (I am not familiar with this outlet, but the typo in the video does not inspire confidence) and a self-published Salvatorian newsletter. Neither are scholarly sources and both are, again, explicitly confessional in nature. I think WP:BIASED may on point in a highly sensitive issue touching on the wider disputes about Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust. Do we know what the Samerski book says, for example? —Brigade Piron (talk) 08:55, 17 October 2021 (UTC) Buidhe It is true that the sources cover Catholic issues, but only the Salvatorian one is actually published by a Catholic institution. I need not go into how varied Catholic newspapers are in their adherence/faithfulness to the Catholic hierarchy and beliefs (see e.g. National Catholic Reporter versus National Catholic Register). But more direclty, there actually are many scholarly RS that discussion Pfeiffer and his works in Nazi-occupied Rome. You will find them on the other language versions of this article. The problem is that I do not read Italian or German well enough to use them in the article. Coverage is not the issue. It is English language coverage. Ergo Sum 13:48, 17 October 2021 (UTC) @Ergo Sum: perhaps add the word "reportedly" before "saved". I'm inclined to accept in good faith the sources used as reliable – none of them have not been deprecated nor deemed generally unreliable. —Bloom6132 (talk) 16:41, 26 October 2021 (UTC) DYK should not cover unconfirmed reports or rumors so I strongly disagree with that suggestion. As well as assuming sources are reliable if they've never been discussed at WP:RSN, which disregards important parts of WP:RS such as WP:CONTEXTMATTERS. There is no issue with citing sources in Italian or German, but if it's not confirmed that they support the content then it's incorrect to assume that they do. (t · c) buidhe 20:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Bloom6132: I tend to think that statements are either supported by RS and written in wikivoice or they're not accepted at all. For that reason, I shy away from words like "reportedly." I reiterate though that I think it's quite clear there's nothing wrong with the sources currently used. They're all RS, so that should be the end of it. Hence, why I think your initial review was satisfactory. Ergo Sum 23:40, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Ergo Sum: agreed. I'm still of the view that the hook satisfies criteria 3b. Criteria 4 states that "Nominations should be rejected if an inspection reveals that they are not based on reliable sources". That is not the case here. —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) You're still ignoring the principle in RS that context matters, and some sources are reliable for some but not other info. The two of us who actually write on Holocaust related topics have expressed that the sources cited are not reliable for the exceptional claims being made. (t · c) buidhe 23:59, 26 October 2021 (UTC) With all due respect, I am of the opinion that the sources used are reliable for the info in the hook. The fact that you and Brigade Piron write on Holocaust-related topics is irrelevant – it does not confer a veto over hooks pertaining to that subject. By that logic, I should be able to veto baseball or heraldry hooks ... —Bloom6132 (talk) 01:10, 27 October 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: Three of my DYKs promoted (including Coat of arms of the Falkland Islands from August this year) have included the word "reportedly" in the hook, as well as numerous hooks from other editors. Disagree all you want – this is accepted practice at DYK. —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: I'm aware that you have experience writing about Holocaust-related articles and I put value in your assessment as a solid editor. However, I'm quite comfortable in my ability to vet RS, as well, and my confidence in these sources means I must disagree with your opinion here. Experienced editors do disagree at times, and it is my opinion that I think you have gotten this one wrong; doubtless, you think the same for me. I haven't seen any evidence that these are not RS. Therefore, I recommend if Bloom6132 is inclined to do so, to renew their approval of the hook. In the meantime, I'm going to request the input of additional experienced editors on the DYK talk page. Ergo Sum 01:28, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm going to ping @Bamse, Bermicourt, Jmabel, and Anyfile to see if we can find some reliable sources in other languages. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 01:46, 27 October 2021 (UTC) Oops, @AnyFile theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 01:47, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm currently traveling & very busy, so not much help here, I'm afraid. - Jmabel | Talk 01:53, 27 October 2021 (UTC) That said, more or less this same case is made in The Pope's Jews: The Vatican's Secret Plan to Save Jews from the Nazis by Gordon Thomas (not currently cited in the article). - Jmabel | Talk 02:00, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm unclear as to why the cited sources are unreliable: are we assuming that all information emanating from a Roman Catholic source is unreliable? If so what's the logic? In any case there are dozens of book sources in English, German, French and Italian that mention Pfeiffer, the problem is that few are accessible online. One is an entire biography of Pfeiffer "from baker to Vatican diplomat" which would be useful to track down: Willer, Philomena (2005). P. Pankratius Pfeiffer SDS: (1872-1945); vom Bäckergesellen zum Vatikandiplomat. Pub: Josef Fink. Others that mentions Pfeiffer and the Jews in Rome are: Liebhart (1996) Schwangau. Meding (1992), Flucht vor Nürnberg. Sinn (1976), Illegal. Bermicourt (talk) 08:41, 27 October 2021 (UTC) My issue is with the unreliability of journalistic works and popular history, which have in many cases published inaccurate information about rescues of Jews during the Holocaust. If better sources exist, they should be cited instead. An additional question is, do these sources actually support the claim of "hundreds" of Jews rescued by Pfeiffer personally? (t · c) buidhe 08:51, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I've now found sources that cover most of the article. Here are more: Liebhart (1996) Schwangau. Meding (1992), Flucht vor Nürnberg. Sinn (1976), Illegal. Prince Constantine of Bavaria (1952) Der Papst. Layer (1985), Schwäbisches Ehrenbuch - Pfeiffer credited with "saving Rome and other Italian cities including Chieti, Ascoli and Ovieto from destruction and other calamities" _ (1999). Publik-Forum - Pfeiffer the only German to have a street named after him in Rome and who fought to save Roman Jews. _ (1960). Bayerische Frömmigkeit - Pfeiffer described as the "Saviour of Rome and other cities in Italy" Robert Katz has written a number of books - Death in Rome (1967), Black Sabbath (1969), The Battle for Rome (2010) - which all mention Pfeiffer. Bottum and Dalin (2004). The Pius War has this interesting piece: "7. Pancrazio [sic] Pfeiffer. According to Carroll-Abbing, one of the men used by Pius XII to protest the Nazi roundup of Rome's Jews and intervene for persecuted victims was Father Pancrazio Pfeiffer, superior general of the Salvatorian Fathers, who also served as Pius XII' personal liaison to the German military command in Rome. Because Pfeiffer died tragically in an automobile accident toward the end of the war and thus never took part in the postwar analysis of Pius XII's conduct, many historians have overlooked him. But those who knew him or have researched his life have chronicled his collaborative efforts with Pius XII to rescue Jews and others during the war. See the article "Pfeiffer's List" by Robert Graham, 30 Days, June 1994, pp. 42-46. Prince Constantine of Bavaria's book on Pius XII, The Pope (London: Allan Wingate, 1954) [listed above] contains an excellent section on Pfeiffer, whom he describes as an agent for the pope on behalf of the victims of persecution and the fugitives in hiding" (p. 213). At Pfeiffer's death in May 1945, Vatican Radio paid tribute: "He came into contact with the Commander of the German occupying forces [in Rome in 1943-44]. From that day onwards, he placed his religious and spiritual qualities at the service of many who had been arrested or already condemned to death. He helped countless people in this way, and saved their lives, among them many Jews and other Italian personages. He championed..." In short there seems to be book evidence for virtually everything stated in the article apart from the specific details of the two incidents where 249 or 400 Jews were rescued. Based on my initial searches my expectation is that those incidents are likely to be recorded in the literature - we just need to be able to access more of the sources. Meanwhile there is no harm in pausing to use some of the above sources, plus those I've added to the Further reading section of the article in order to reinforce the existing references and then review where we are.

For example, Salvatorians USA Province is not independent of the article subject and therefore is not reliable for self-serving assertions such as "he saved many Jews in Rome from persecution and ultimately death" or "Every day, Pfeiffer visited the Regina Coeli prison and another prison on Via Tasso, where he would often return with freed prisoners who had been sentenced to death." (t · c) buidhe 08:27, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: would you still object if the article instead relied on the sources found by Bermicourt? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 04:58, 5 November 2021 (UTC) Depends, the Samerski source looks reliable to me but the book published by "Österreichische Provinz der Salvatorianer" has the same issue of close connection to the article subject. (t · c) buidhe 06:27, 5 November 2021 (UTC) All right. @Ergo Sum: I'm not going to promote the nomination without consensus to move forward, so if you want to try and rework the article's sourcing to approval, that can work.

Ergo Sum 15:45, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I have added several inline citations to the article, which refer to sources that were (very helpfully) added by Bermicourt. These sources support several of the very specific claims in the article, as well as the general thrust of the article which is in dispute here, namely that Pfeiffer was a liaison and in that capacity saved many Jews and others from the Nazis. In light of these reliable sources supporting the general claims, I think any concern about the pre-existing ones describing some of his more specific actions is ameliorated. There is a trove of additional sources in the Further Reading section that additionally describe in much greater detail Pfeiffer's actions but they are either in a foreign language which I do not adequately read to make use of as citations or are offline. All being said, I think there is now ample sourcing to back up the article's claims. Ergo Sum 05:49, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks, Ergo Sum—@Buidhe:, if this sourcing is up to your standards, we can move ahead. If not, we're probably going back to WT:DYK and asking for more eyes. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 05:52, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Hi, I've flagged the specific content in the article that supports the hook as needing a better source. There are other active cleanup tags on the article as well. However, I think there's sufficient sourcing for a modified version of the hook without the words "hundreds of". (t · c) buidhe 06:06, 17 November 2021 (UTC) We could cite "countless" using the ref above instead of "hundreds of". Bermicourt (talk) 08:33, 17 November 2021 (UTC) According to the source it's what Vatican Radio said about him after his death. DYK is not for eulogies imo. (t · c) buidhe 08:37, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I'm not following—is the source unreliable because it's after his death? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 08:40, 17 November 2021 (UTC) No, it's because it's Catholic presumably... We could always add "according to Vatican Radio..." But better still, we just need to cite the exact text from one of the many non-Catholic book sources and the problem will be solved. Bermicourt (talk) 08:46, 17 November 2021 (UTC) And yet another source: O'Reilly (2001) in Forgotten Battles: Italy's War of Liberation 1943-45 states that "the Vatican was able to assist many of Rome's Jews and others sought by the Germans through Father Pancrazio Pfeiffer's intervention with the Germans... His work was recounted by Robert Graham who has written extensively on the Vatican's role in World War II." Bermicourt (talk) 09:01, 17 November 2021 (UTC) And another: Bartley (2016) in Catholics Confronting Hitler states that "Father Pancrace [sic] Pfeiffer, a German priest and the superior general of the Salvatorian Order, was the pope's liaison with the German military. Several hundred hostages, including some under sentence of death, owed their release to the efficacious intervention of Father Pfeiffer." I don't know why I'm doing this - you can look up the references yourselves instead of opining and speculating from the sidelines in the classic Wikipedia way. :) Bermicourt (talk) 09:08, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @Bermicourt: Since it seems you have access to several sources that I do not (probably just requires further digging), would you want to add them as inline citations with page numbers, especially to support the proposition regarding hundreds of people saved?

I'd be in favor instead of the hook being split into two separate proposals: one hook about the fact that she was an internet celebrity who grew up in a place without tap water, and a separate hook about her going viral for making hamburgers. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:23, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Full review needed, which can also address the issue of the borderline ALT1 hook. BlueMoonset (talk) 04:23, 5 November 2021 (UTC) As far as I can tell the article meets DYK requirements, and a QPQ has been done. Earwigs finds a close match with Coda Media, but that's only because it was the source for quotes in the article, and all of them are properly referenced. I find the first hook hard to believe given China's international standing, and in any case as brought up by Bowlhover may be inaccurate anyway. As for the second hook, as I mentioned before it's ineligible as it's exactly 200 characters long, and per WP:DYK hooks that are at or shorter than 200 characters may be rejected per reviewer's discretion. Both ALT0 and ALT1 have struck: I am repeating my earlier suggestion that ALT1 instead be split into two separate hooks. As this is a China-related article and there appear to be some political discussion in the article, I'd also like to ask for a second opinion from someone more knowledgeable about China-related articles if the article doesn't fall afoul of relevant guidelines. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 13:12, 6 November 2021 (UTC) From Wikipedia:Did you know#The hook: The hook should be concise: no more than about 200 characters (including spaces and the question mark, but not including the ..., the space immediately following the ..., or any (pictured)). While 200 is a hard limit, hooks near or at this limit may still be rejected at the discretion of reviewers and administrators. This tool can be used for counting words. The guideline says that "200 is a hard limit", so it is not true that the 200-character ALT1 hook is "ineligible" or "simply too long". No reason has been given for rejecting a 200-character hook "at the discretion of reviewers". Here are two additional hooks based on the suggestion: ALT2: ... that Dianxi Xiaoge, who grew up in a remote Yunnan mountain without running water, is an Internet celebrity with roughly 16 million subscribers on all her platforms? ALT3: ... Dianxi Xiaoge went viral in China and internationally after making hamburgers for her grandparents who had never eaten them before? Cunard (talk) 07:48, 7 November 2021 (UTC) Well for one thing, the original was very difficult to read and seemed to combine too many facts into one hook. Usually DYK prefers simpler hooks whenever possible. In any case, I think ALT3 is the best hook here and the nomination is otherwise good to go, I'd just like to hear a second opinion from another editor on the article tone given that I'm a bit uncomfortable doing a solo review here given the "Commentary" section delves into some political matters. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:36, 7 November 2021 (UTC) On second thought, I have some concerns regarding the length of the article. Isn't it rather detailed for an internet celebrity's page? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 11:10, 7 November 2021 (UTC) That the article is "rather detailed for an internet celebrity's page" should not be a concern. The sources provided substantial analysis of her and her work, and this article reflects those sources. Other detailed articles for Internet celebrities include PewDiePie and MrBeast. Cunard (talk) 11:18, 7 November 2021 (UTC) Pinging Gatoclass for his input, as he responded to a discussion I raised about this nomination over at WT:DYK. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:57, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I don't think we need Gatoclass to restate themself. Here's what they said at WT:DYK: The article doesn't use the phrase "one of only three Chinese influencers to gain international influence", so I'm not sure where you got that, but it does say she is one of only three "Chinese Internet celebrities who have reached international prominence", and the problem with that claim is that it's sourced to an article that is two years old and therefore not up-to-date. With regard to the overall length, I would agree that it is overly detailed and could use a trim. I'm not sure this is relevant to DYK however, as "overly detailed" is not one of our criteria. What I would say is that the level of detail does raise the chances of close paraphrasing so the article would need to be carefully checked for that. Anybody else with an opinion on this article?

Thriley (talk) 20:57, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @Thriley: I'll ping BlueMoonset here in case I'm wrong, but I'm going to say no, it isn't. My reasoning here is that if the hook were read as plaintext, without any bolding or linking, it would be read as pretty much only interesting as it concerns the plot. The hook should concern Smit's life; if it concerns her work as an actress, only stating her role and not anything about production doesn't make the hook out-of-universe. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 21:28, 17 November 2021 (UTC) theleekycauldron, I was taking a look at the ALT1 hook and its sources, and the second Biography sentence is basically copied from Esquire—the Google translate version, at any rate. That's a problem. Another problem is that the source doesn't actually say that she was working as a hotel receptionist when she got the call, just that it was "one of these jobs", referring back to the four in the previous sentence, none of which were hotel receptionist. The article also needs a bit of copyediting. I don't think that either of the plot-based hooks should be used, and as Drmies notes, "first film" is not accurate, since it's Cross the Line that's in the source, which appears to be her fifth film. We could only use "first feature film" if the previous four in her filmography were all short films (which would need to be clearly sourced). Perhaps an angle for the information in ALT1 would be to say she was working in whatever job it was when she was cast in Cross the Line, for which she was nominated as best new actress in the Goya Awards. BlueMoonset (talk) 02:31, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Here’s an article that states she was working as a receptionist two years before she was hired to work on Parallel Mothers:[6] Does it appear reliable? Thriley (talk) 05:38, 20 November 2021 (UTC) I don't see a reason to doubt the source. However, it isn't sufficient to support the "when she was called" hook claim, just that she was a hotel receptionist two years before the article was written (and possibly two years and a number of months, since you can't assume it's exactly two years). BlueMoonset (talk) 17:14, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Perhaps the hook should include all her various jobs before her Almodovar role? Thriley (talk) 01:47, 23 November 2021 (UTC) ALT3 “before starring in the Pedro Almodóvar film Parallel Mothers, Milena Smit worked as a model, waitress, shop assistant, babysitter, teleoperator, subway information assistant, and hotel receptionist?” El País Thriley (talk) 01:51, 23 November 2021 (UTC) That hook is 197 characters which puts it in discretionary territory. Given though that the hookiness here is that she did all of these non-acting jobs, I think in this case the length is justified since it hasn't reached the limit.

I do like the hooks and it's an intriguing subject for an article! I wanted to flag the following comments, in case they are helpful (please ignore if not!): I don't quite follow this sentence in the lead: "Moreover, it is still pointed out that the emendation Albruna agrees with the names of other Germanic wise women." Should "instriptions" (before the Drusus heading) be "inscriptions"? Should the names of scholars be wikilinked, where there is a page for the author (e.g. Simek)? What does mss mean, and could this be explained when it is first referenced? The second paragraph of the Aurinia section has two sentences starting with "However" in a row, which is a bit awkward to read.

To be expected, since they're cited almost 20 times each, and since the vast majority of the matches concern long quotes I'm willing to overlook it, but can we add more citations throughout the paragraphs? Particularly with "Conflict with Miles and Reynolds", there's four citations crammed at the end of the section. I think we should cite each after the corresponding sentences, especially where there's a direct quotation. Also for ALT0 we need a citation at the ends of the sentences for "Golden Boy" and "Whiz Kid". Otherwise nice read, and good use of sources.

Its long enough and new and lots of good refs - including the hook fact. It documents a notable woman from the 14th century and there were not many of those.

Nice addition. well done Victuallers (talk) 10:31, 6 November 2021 (UTC) Reopening this because I think the hook is misleading, as according to the source it was usual for women of the nobility, like Neville, to sign with their own names. Gatoclass (talk) 02:10, 19 November 2021 (UTC) @Gatoclass: I don't think most will know that, so maybe we go with ALT1 or some variation on it? We don't need to say it's unusual if we phrase it that way theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 02:14, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Theleekycauldron, the problem with both hooks is that they imply that there was something out-of-the-ordinary in a woman signing something in her own name in that era, whereas the source indicates that was normal practice for women of the nobility. So the hooks are misleading. Gatoclass (talk) 02:19, 19 November 2021 (UTC) All right—I'll ping @Lajmmoore and Victuallers: back here, y'all can work this out. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 02:33, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Was it usual for women in the fourteenth century to sign with their own name ... no. Is is usual for women in the 21st century to sign with just their first name? No. So "did you know that unusually Canada's head of state signs documents with just her first name and an R for Regina?" (Someone shouts) "BUT all British Queens do that!!" (Someone shouts) "That implies that it was unusual for Queens to sign with just their first name." No it doesnt. I think @Gatoclass: is reading the source and then saying that the hook doesnt explain every piece of information in the source... which obviously it doesnt. Its unusual that "a woman" is doing this at all. It WAS unusual for women in the fourteenth century to sign and if they did then they did not usually use just their own name. Its a fact - its unusual. Did You know that women did not sign their own names on documents in the 14th century? No I didnt. That is something that Lajmmoore wrote about and now I know. Thanks. Victuallers (talk) 08:28, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Hello Gatoclass all so the part of the source I was using is this, which is talking about signatures for charitable donation "Although most of the widows declare themselves to be the wife of their late husband, or their father's daughter, others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names, such as 'domina Margareta de Longvl' and 'don-ýina Margareta de Nevill' (the same person). The majority of widows declare that their marital status and their power to act, using a variety of phrases, including 'in pura viduitate', 'in pura viduitate mea et ligia potestate', and 'in viduitate mea propria et potestate legitima' ..." and I read that as it was more usual for (noble) women to use a signature that described them as "wife of, etc..." I read the passage as Legg using Margaret de Neville as an unusual example. Legg is talking about the Coucher Book signatures specifically, but I still think they are marking out unusual practice. In terms of the hook, I wonder whether changing 'woman' to 'literate woman' might work? Lajmmoore (talk) 09:32, 19 November 2021 (UTC) No, it wouldn't work just to add "literate". And your reading of the text just amounts to an unsupported assumption on your part. Because while the text could admittedly be less ambiguous, the statement that others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names does not in any way suggest that it was rare or unusual for a member of the nobility to give their name, it only states that members of the nobility as a class were inclined to give their names. So there isn't sufficient support in that statement for a hook which implies that Neville's act was in any way unusual for a member of her class. The hook makes Neville sound like some sort of proto-feminist who boldly challenged the system, when the underlying source only indicates that either her entire class did the same thing, or at least that it was an accepted practice for members of the nobility. So I still think that either the hook needs to be substantially reworked to more closely reflect the source, or a new hook be found. Gatoclass (talk) 02:53, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks for sharing your interpretation of your text Gatoclass. My interpretation (& so the hook) is based on Legg's use of the word most - in that "most of the widows declare themselves to be the wife of their late husband, or their father's daughter" and you rightly point out "others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names" but I think that needs to be balanced by the "most" earlier in the sentence i.e. for women generally, they don't give their name, but some noble women do but overall, for women signing their name, it is unusual enough to be pointed out in the text.

Whispyhistory (talk) 04:04, 13 November 2021 (UTC) @Whispyhistory: But that would be impossible, the article can't possibly mention IP addresses, it's about broken toes.

It's okay with me if allowed (dyk says hook needs to be in article and in the following ref). Whispyhistory (talk) 06:32, 13 November 2021 (UTC) I don't see that exact sequence of numbers in the source, although there are others that look a bit like an IP address. The trouble is, the nominator seems to be the source for it looking a bit like an IP address, which it does, but we can't use that unless the source makes a similar point, which it does not appear to do. Something like this might work (numbers might need to be changed as mentioned): ALT1 ... that a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone may be described as 88.5.3.2? Philafrenzy (talk) 10:16, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Regarding the image, it's a fun idea but I don't think we run images as quizzes and the image is simply a skeletal foot, and not closely enough related to the hook.

I don't see how the hook you're suggesting is hooky. What exactly is wrong with the hook proposed? It's in the article and it's supported by the sources cited. And the image is directly related to the hook. It engages the reader into a spotting game. Dr. Vogel (talk) 14:57, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Like everyone else, I rather like the IP-address hook. If we wikilinked IP address, it would be supported in the linked articles, and fulfill the requirement that anyone following the links will be able to verify the hook. I don't think we need sourcing that says that a specific sequence of numbers is an IP address, as we have sources giving the general format of an IP address, and creating an example would be a trivial calculation ("Are all four of these numbers separated by periods in the range 0-255?"): "IPv4 and IPv6 address formats". www.ibm.com. An IPv4 address has the following format: x . x . x . x where x is called an octet and must be a decimal value between 0 and 255. Octets are separated by periods. An IPv4 address must contain three periods and four octets. The following examples are valid IPv4 addresses: 1 . 2 . 3 . 4 01 . 102 . 103 . 104 This hook is better than any alternative I can think of, and I don't see anything likely to be problematic about it (it's certainly verifiable). I think we might be in agreement on that? So if some rule technically prohibits it, we might have a good case for applying the WP:Ignore all the rules policy. Broken finger is also currently DYK-eligible and I think it uses the same numbering scheme.[1] HLHJ (talk) 02:07, 14 November 2021 (UTC) [edit: add fulltext url] I don't necessarily agree with the reading of WP:DYKCRIT 3b ( Each fact in the hook must be supported in the article by at least one inline citation to a reliable source [...]) that says that the IP thing needs to be in the article (compare e.g. Template:Did you know nominations/Urine deflector, which similarly took some creative licence in how the proposed hooks were phrased beyond what was stated in either the article or the cited source), and I agree with HLHJ that WP:IAR would be applicable regardless. As for the hooks themselves, writing "a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone may be described as 88.5.3.2" is a much poorer way of writing the hook (less "hooky") than the converse, i.e. "88.5.3.2 may refer to a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone". TompaDompa (talk) 11:28, 14 November 2021 (UTC) This. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 17:01, 16 November 2021 (UTC) We can't use IP address because the nominator just thought it up "oh, that looks like an IP address". It's not in the source as the nominator admits and therefore is not verifiable. And so what if it does look like an IP address? What does that tell us about broken toes? I like clever or quirky hooks and have written many (if I may say so), but they have to be based on something in the sources otherwise it's things made up one day. Philafrenzy (talk) 10:19, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you for all your comments. This is not the place to ignore all rules. The proposed hook is not supported by the source given in the article. I am inclined to approve ALT1 but it needs checking, unless another hook is proposed. Whispyhistory (talk) 15:11, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Oh dear, this has become contentious. I think the contended question is whether it's acceptable to have verified information not found in the nominated article, but only in another article, linked in the hook. Not as hooky, but for illustration: ALT3 ... that the dot-decimal notation string "88.5.3.2" is not only an an IPv4 address, but also a fracture in the middle of the bone at the tip of the little toe? "IPv4 and IPv6 address formats". www.ibm.com., Hallux proximal phalanx fracture in adults: an overlooked diagnosis I don't think we're debating whether the IP-address-hook statement is verifiable. The statement that "88.5.3.2" (and any number in that format) is a valid IPv4 address is supported by the IP address article and the IPv4 article, and this format is the subject of the Dot-decimal notation article. No-one had bothered to cite those statements in those articles, but since they've been challenged here, I've now cited them. So "88.5.3.2 is both an IP address[1] and a code for a broken toebone[2]" is certainly verifiable, and is now verified on Wikipedia. Any DYK reader should have no trouble verifying that the hook is accurate. Alternatives that do not mention IP addressees are not as hooky, but don't contain more information about broken toes: ALT4 ... that "88.5.3.2" is a toe fracture in the middle of the bone at the tip of the little toe, while a "78.5.3.2" is the parallel broken finger?

Philafrenzy (talk) 19:25, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you Philafrenzy ( a very experienced DYK contributor) for your efforts in helping new editors understand DYK. Your comment higher up about "88.5.3.2" and "ip address" not being in the source is true and I am grateful for your suggested alts. Essentially, the initial and subsequent hooks sound good, but none are in the article or the source. I don't wish for personal comments and don't mind if someone else wishes to take over here. With due respect @DrVogel: and @HLHJ:...You may wish to take this up at Wikipedia talk:Did you know. Whispyhistory (talk) 10:41, 15 November 2021 (UTC) I won't say I wish I hadn't written the article; I hope it's useful enough to make up for the social harm to the project here. I don't think the hostility was intended by anyone; I suspect that it's felt partly due to the ease of mininterpretation in a text-only medium and partly due to human cognitive biases.[2] I certainly did, and do, not intend it. I spent a day's editing trying to resolve the conflict by finding references specifically saying that the two things were in notation X and adding that text to the article, but unfortunately non-inductive descriptions of the notations seem to have been considered so needless that an Internet RFC attempting to formalize them died of disinterest. I did find a source that explicitly defines the IPv4 format, and one that explicitly says that 88.1.2.2 is a specific fracture, and I've cited the latter in the article, but I don't think this helps. It is probably a bit unreasonable to expect a reviewer to do more than apply rules as best they can, and Wikipedia talk:Did you know might indeed be a better forum for a more detailed discussion. I don't really want to take part in one, though (nothing to do with this discussion, prior reasons). I posted because I felt responsible for the conflict and thought I might be able to help. My impression is that I made it worse; my apologies to everyone I've offended. HLHJ (talk) 03:41, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Nobody is offended, but if I may say so I think you are still missing the point. IP addresses have nothing to do with broken toes even if that notation may have a similarity. That's why the sources don't make the comparison and why the IP-based hooks are no good. Any of the other hooks might be fine (I haven't checked the numbers) just without the bit about IP addresses. The whole thing reminds me of unusually shaped vegetables where you may see a carrot shaped like a foot, people who see faces in clouds, and even apophenia. My personal observation that one thing looks a bit like another is not the basis for a hook unless reliable sources make the point too. Philafrenzy (talk) 09:09, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Folks, we are wasting a wonderful hook. Really. IP addresses have nothing to do with broken toes even if that notation may have a similarity and that is the whole point of making good hooks. They are supposed to be short, punchy, catchy, and likely to draw the readers in to wanting to read the article – as long as they don't misstate the article content. And one of the best recipes to make a hook good is to make it sound counterintuitive With any other option but the original, we are bound to receive another hook frequented by maybe a few hundred visitors. I would propose something to the tune of in some contexts, 88.5.3.2 might not mean an IP address but a broken bone in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone? so that no one claims here that we somehow delegitimise the IP address but at the same time so that we preserve the core of the hook. As for the claims that because the hook is not cited in the IP part, it can't be there - please don't be that pedantic. In our today's world of informatics we may assume that people who visit Wikipedia more or less imagine what IP addresses are, and may more or less imagine how they look like (in the worst case they will visit the article for details). The other part is cited. I see no problem with the original. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 17:01, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Szmenderowiecki I admit that I'm not very familiar with the topic, and the above discussion was confusing, but is the "this isn't an IP address" claim actually in the source? Because if it's not, then no matter how good the hook proposal is, it can't be used in a hook since hook facts need to be based on a reference. Also, I'm pretty sure that assumptions don't count as sources. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:31, 17 November 2021 (UTC) What I was leading is that we don't need to cite that the sky is blue, or that we have five fingers; or that there exist IP addresses for that matter.

We're allowed to. This is not a massive occasion where we can save the whole project by breaking the rules. Its a trivial example of what some (not all) think may be a breach in the rules, with a small, but amusing, advantage. So I'm not asking the defenders of the rules to admit that this is not a breech ... I am suggesting that they might just concede that the harm done by allowing this hook might not offend anyone ... and it might please a few thousand. Victuallers (talk) 15:28, 20 November 2021 (UTC) We don't need to break the rules. The observation that the notation looks a bit like an IP address is trivial and completely unrelated to broken toes. There are already perfectly good hooks above that work better. Nobody is saying don't use the numbers, just strike the bit about IP addresses. The originally proposed hook is not the work of comic genius and cleverness that some seem to think it is. Philafrenzy (talk) 21:58, 20 November 2021 (UTC) The main issue here is that it's one of the core rules of DYK that hook facts must be mentioned in the article, ideally explicitly or at least implied by supporting information. The thing is that at the moment, IP addresses are not mentioned anywhere in the article, so the hooks using the IP address angle would be ineligible according to that criterion anyway. Even April Fools hooks, which tend to be misleading, are still generally based on hook facts that are mentioned in the respective articles. So if we can't even grant IAR exemptions for that criterion for AFD hooks, the one day of the year where our hooks tend to follow the rules most loosely, I can't see why such a request should be granted here.

Nominated by Victuallers (talk) at 16:21, 6 November 2021 (UTC). Article is new enough. Two correct writers are credited. The article is fully referenced. No copyvio detected. There is a bit of biased POV pushing in Wikipedia voice: "most vulnerable to climate change". This will be something our subject is saying no doubt. And this idea is also reflected in the hook with "endangered". The hook content is referenced and confirmed by the Guardian, apart from the "endangered" bit, which opinion is attributed to Tina Stege. So I suggest that "endangered" is taken out of the hook, or it is reworded so it is clear she is saying that. Hook alt1 is unsuitable as it does not link the article and I cannot tell what it is trying to say in relation to the subject. I can confirm image is CC-BY-3.0 as derived from the video with CC-BY-3.0 license. However I would suggest that a different image is selected from the video, perhaps near the end where the microphone is not obscuring her chin. QPQ is done. Graeme Bartlett (talk) 06:03, 15 November 2021 (UTC) @Graeme Bartlett: Thanks for the review Graeme - I have recut a new image. Surprised that "endangered" wasn't referenced. I'm not sure it is just her opinion -"Projected sea level rise would mean 40% of the buildings in the Marshall Islands’ capital of Majuro would be permanently flooded and entire islands would disappear, potentially costing the Pacific country its status as a nation, according to a devastating new report from the World Bank." is a quote from the reference I have added to balance the idea that "endangered" might by pov.

Graeme Bartlett (talk) 20:56, 22 November 2021 (UTC) @Graeme Bartlett: Are you suggesting that we imply that "endangered" is her opinion despite the fact that she represents a nation and the "endangered" aspect is supported by the World Bank and the Guardian newspaper (and the 1bn people estimated to be part of the "High Ambition" group ) saying so? Is there any evidence that is just her opinion and not that of her country and the World Bank? Am I missing something? It you feel you need to give this "a cross" then can I suggest that we ask for a new reviewer?I have suggested an alt that does not use the endangered word.

Self-nominated at 23:51, 4 November 2021 (UTC). @DferDaisy: This article is about 3300 bytes, and was nominated for DYK shortly after creation, satisfying date and length criteria. There is a factual error, as the article states she was interred in Keokuk, Illinois, but the source says she died in Chicago, Illinois and was interred in Keokuk, Iowa. I am assuming good faith for a few references I cannot access (for example, ref 15 - The National Humane Review), which for me gives a landing page for the document, instead of an inside view). Otherwise, everything is properly sourced and there are no copyvio or close paraphrasing concerns (Earwig cites 3 potential problems, but they are not an issue here.) QPQ not required. Regarding the hooks, ALT0 is incorrect as stated, as it reads as if the study was conducted in the early 1900s by Meigs Crowder, whereas she published it in 1917 based on studies from that period. It'll need minor alteration. ALT1 is fine and sourced. I would prefer to promote an amended ALT0. A minor quibble, though not an issue for DYK: please add page numbers for cited sources. If online access is eliminated from the sources, it'll force anyone investigating those sources to wade through too many pages to find the desired detail.

AleatoryPonderings (???) (!!!) 01:52, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @AleatoryPonderings: Yes, but note that this court case is the "leading case with respect to the issue of common employers", establishing a precedent in Canadian law. At the time the lawsuit was filed, this was not the case, and in fact the trial judge ruled against Alouche (see last paragraph of background section); it was only after the case was brought to the Court of Appeal for Ontario that the "common employer doctrine" was established, and it became entrenched when leave to appeal the decision at the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed. Mindmatrix 15:11, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Ah, so the idea behind the hook is that, since Downtown Eatery changed the law on common employers, before Downtown Eatery Best Beaver would not have been Alouche's employer? That makes more sense. AleatoryPonderings (???) (!!!) 15:20, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: I'm going to inspect this again... Mindmatrix 15:18, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @AleatoryPonderings: Alright, so to ensure everything is correct, the following timeline occurred: Alouche was hired to be manager at For Your Eyes Only (owned by Grad and Grosman), and began work on 29 December 1992 Alouche was sent a Notice of Discipline in May 1993, and was fired on 15 June 1993 In October 1993, Alouche filed action for wrongful dismissal against Best Beaver Management Inc., as that was the source of his paycheques Best Beaver ceased operations in mid-1996, and all assets distributed to other companies owned by Grad and Grosman The trial resolved in favour of Alouche Best Beaver did not pay out the judgement (all its assets had been redistributed) Sherriffs were dispatched to For Your Eyes Only, where they seized $1,855 Downtown Eatery filed claim against Alouche, stating the cash belonged to it Alouche defended, and counterclaimed against Grad, Grosman, and all companies they controlled on the grounds of common employer doctrine, the oppression remedy of the Ontario Business Corporations Act, and fraudulent conveyance the judge in the second trial (at Ontario Superior Court of Justice) ruled against Alouche the case was brought to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, where the previous ruling was overturned in 2001 in January 2002, an application for leave to appeal the decision at the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed So, the common employer doctrine was part of the second trial as a counterclaim to the suit filed by Downtown Eatery. I just wanted to ensure this satisfies your concerns. Mindmatrix 18:25, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks for this incredibly thorough response. My concern is maybe philosophical or definitional. If I say that company A employs person B, that has an ordinary meaning and a legal meaning. It is probably right that Best Beaver did not employ Alouche in the ordinary sense of "employ", because Best Beaver was a "paymaster" and not the name on the front of the building where he went to work. My reading of the case itself is that, before Downtown Eatery, it was at best indeterminate as a legal matter whether Best Beaver, alone or in combination with its affiliate companies, employed Alouche. After Downtown Eatery, it was established—as a matter of legal meaning, but not necessarily ordinary meaning—that Best Beaver was his employer, or part of his employer, or something like that. The reason I brought this up is that it's not clear how one could verify the claim that "Best Beaver was not Alouche's employer", because that claim might be true as a matter of ordinary meaning but the only authoritative legal ruling we have on this (namely, Downtown Eatery) holds that the claim is false. In any event, I'll leave this to the eventual reviewer to sort out. I find my brain twisting into knots. AleatoryPonderings (???)

However, it includes a WP:IMDB source and I am unsure about the reliability of several other sources, including Film Ink, Queer Media Matters, Antaeus.org, Fern TV, Addicted to Horror Movies, Dan's Papers, Go Mag, Three Women in a Box and North Coast Rep. To add to that, the YouTube link does not appear to be uploaded by an official channel, making it unreliable. Additionally, per MOS:FILMCAST uncredited roles need a source. the copyvio checker showed up a 50%+ similarity with a source, which may suggest over quotation. On top of that, the subject has unclear notability. I'm unsure which roles are significant and The House on Pine Street appears to have a questionable notability. None of her awards seem significant and I'm not seeing any significant coverage from reliable, independent sources. ALT0 isn't very interesting given the festival is not significant enough to have an article. I think ALT1 is interesting but it seems to focus more on the character, not the actress which isn't exactly ideal... QPQ not needed. We'll need some work but we'll get there!

Thanks, DanCherek. while the article is over 1,500 prose characters, I'm going to be a stickler and say that this is still a stub.

Moving on, the article was created from a redir and nominated in time and is neutral, although I'm requesting a second opinion on the sourcing. The article seems to be plagiarism free, and a QPQ has been done. As for the hook, I'm not sure it quite checks out—is the church expected to break away?

Once we clear those two up, we're good to go. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 02:41, 21 November 2021 (UTC) @Theleekycauldron: Not entirely sure what the concern on the sourcing is; there are multiple reputable sources.

Thanks! ~ Pbritti (talk) 05:10, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Isn't there a difference between "planned" (alt1) and "expected" (alt0)? planned implies it may or may not happen, expected is like forecasting—at least, that's how i read it. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 05:19, 21 November 2021 (UTC) @Theleekycauldron: Merriam-Webster considers them definitionally synonymous terms (see definition 2).

Maximilian Dood ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that in August 2021, YouTuber Maximilian Dood's viral social media campaign for Marvel vs. Capcom 2's rerelease caught the regards of studio Digital Eclipse, who expressed interest in rereleasing the game? Source: 1 and 2 Comment: This is the first time I’ve ever made a DYK here, so here goes. I personally find this fact interesting because it highlights how the advent of YouTube, and internet fame in general, has allowed people to use their voice to reach people in positions of high influence, bringing hidden ideas to light and advocating for change. While this specific example falls under a video game/pop-culture category, and may not fit Wikipedia’s desire for academic material, I feel that this is interesting enough to share, as it’s one the gaming community can relate to, like with other social media trends such as #FreeSmash and "Rerelease Mother 3." As for the article itself, all of the citations should be reliable enough; they’re all from third-party/secondary source outlets and there isn’t any BLP violation to be found here. One concern I have is criteria #3 - “Each fact in the hook must be supported in the article by at least one inline citation to a reliable source, appearing no later than the end of the sentence(s) offering that fact. Citations at the end of the paragraph are not sufficient.” While the hook is sourced in the article, the refs are at the end of the section rather than per each sentence. I can fix that however. Anyway, I hope this fact does get accepted! If not, I understand, thanks for reviewing this anyway. Created/expanded by PantheonRadiance (talk). Self-nominated at 08:45, 17 November 2021 (UTC).

Newness requirement satisfied by 5x expansion on 11/15 from < 600 to > 3000 characters. Articles also long enough and compliant with core policies on citations and neutrality. The hook is in-line sourced. Photo has appropriate license. QPQ is done. There are, however, two problems: (1) There is some significant overlap with this source. To start, the following sentence is taken from the source without use of quotation marks and with no effort to paraphrase rather than use the precise words: "Local advocacy led to the establishment of Bridle Trails as a state park in 1932." Further, this sentence also strikes me as too closely drawn from the same source: "Initial park development dates to 1933 when Civil Works Administration employees and federal relief workers were employed in state parks as part of the New Deal program. Further work included burning logging debris, clearing brush and building trails and fences." Work needs to be done to put the material into your own words. (2) The hook strikes me as boring in that it states an obvious point. Horses having the right of way on this trail is not unique or special. On trails that are shared by humans and horses, it is the general rule that horses have the right of way. See here ("In general, horses always have the right of way, followed by hikers, then by bikers."). See also here ("For safety reasons, if you come across a horse and rider on any trail they always have right of way. Hikers and bike riders all yield to horses.")

For one, the quote is not actually "could have been made by aliens" so, considering this is all about misquotation, we should either use the actual quote or clarify that it is a misquotation.

Graham87 09:41, 18 November 2021 (UTC) @Gerda Arendt: Thank you for the review. Diamonds were often cut in cabochon style in the 19th century and earlier. This one was cut with a flat bottom like all cabochons, and when viewed from above, it was a large oval, about 1.5 inches long. Modern cabochons usually have a smoothly rounded surface; this one was lightly faceted but the facets don't show on the sculpture. So it looks like half an egg, I suppose. The Koh-i-Noor is the large oval at the bottom of the picture. We have no specific citation for artistic licence - that is just a conclusion that we can probably make, since we have no evidence that Victoria ever had it set in a necklace. Therefore I cannot use "artistic licence" in a hook or in the article. I'll have a go at a hook using a full-length Victoria, and another hook using the Warrior and Wounded Youth sculpture. I'll come back shortly with those.

Self-nominated at 22:50, 16 November 2021 (UTC). @Ritchie333: Article is a new, plagiarism free, neutral, and well sourced not-stub (1633B). As for the hooks, I'm going to reject ALT0 out of hand, because Ben Comeau can take a number on that one. I'm also going to say no to ALT1, not because it's uncivil or uninteresting, but because it should be quoted—I've suggested two minor alts. A QPQ is also needed. Let me know what you think—nice work! — Preceding unsigned comment added by Theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) 02:57, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Re 1a, I don't see how we know that Comeau personally thinks of Trump; these could have been works-for-hire, after all. I've been trying to come up with something catchy on this -- for example, had Comeau invited Trump to participate in a performance of the work, then we could say he told Trump to fugue himself -- but the sourcing just isn't there that I can see. In consolation, here's an enlightening bit of musical history you will want to share with friends and family: Q: Why did Bach have so many children? Unhide for answer A: Because he didn't have any stops in his organ. In fact, he wore out three organs fuguing. Thanks may be left on my talk page. EEng 16:47, 17 November 2021 (UTC) The video for "Boris Johnson is a Lying Shit" includes a description from Comeau that basically screams for people not to vote for him, and the one for "Donald Trump is a Wanker" says "As satisfying as it is to poke fun at the Orange Monster, this video on its own probably won’t do the teeniest thing to reduce the devastation inflicted by the Trump administration. I therefore want to use this platform to suggest ways we can contribute to meaningful anti-Trump resistance.". We'd need to flesh out the article with these WP:BLPPRIMARY sources for the "thinks" to be properly verifiable.

There is over-linking in the hook. Copyvio seems fine (ignoring the 90% violation, which is a website which copies Wikipedia) QPQ not required.

Or that the Abendmusiken were actually presented right after Vespers?[3] Vespers, which themselves lasted two or three hours, in addition to a further three or four hour Hauptgottesdienst in the morning?[4][5] That might be one of the reasons why the audience was reported to be so disorderly, to the point that the town watch had to be hired to maintain a semblance of order.[6] That, and a lot more, which would surely allow to take this to DYK at a later time, after having greatly expanded this.

Fact is, I have the score and the whole text (including in translation) with me, in addition to lots of critical commentary on the piece itself (too much of which is focused on the question of authenticity, but alas...) and on the Abendmusiken in general. This can be used to make a proper article, but it would require time, which at the moment I really need to put into meeting an actual deadline than here. I've given you a list of pertinent sources (many of which are in German, if that's easier for you), if you're interested you know where to ask. On top of all of that, there's the question of article title (should it be at the current one or at Wacht! Euch zum Streit gefasset macht (a title which is used in a fair amount of sources, too...)

Overall: Article meets eligibility criteria. i.e newness and article length. Article is well sourced and is neutral in tone. Hook is interesting and is cited. Copyvio scores ~20% in major part due to a quote that has been attributed rightly. However, the nominator might want to consider removing the quote and rewriting the sentence because the original Nepal Times article does not have it as a quote and is likely a paraphrasing done by the newspaper to begin with. Hence, we should not include it as a quote. In addition, I would encourage the nominator to consider expanding the article - to be clear, the article is good to go as-is. But looking at Hanuman Dhoka for instance there is an opportunity to build this article more than just a "History" section. Handing it back to the nominator. Some work and this is ready for homepage. Good luck.

Further information: Official supplementary guidelines and unofficial guide  Warning: You are not logged in. Please create an account or log in to proceed. Alternatively, you may leave a message at the bottom of the DYK project talk page with the article you would like to nominate and the hook you would like to propose.  Warning: The helper script only works on desktop. Please switch to desktop view to continue. Install the DYK helper script by adding the line {{subst:lusc|User:SD0001/DYK-helper.js}} to your common.js page. Go back to the article, and choose the "DYK" option from the "More" menu (see image). Fill in the form and submit it. Check back periodically to address comments or concerns from the reviewer (it may take several weeks). Manual instructions[edit] Create a subpage for your new DYK suggestion and then list the page below under the date the article was created or the expansion began or it became a good article (not the date you submit it here), with the newest dates at the bottom. Any registered user may nominate a DYK suggestion (if you are not a registered user, please leave a message at the bottom of the DYK project talk page with the details of the article you would like to nominate and the hook you would like to propose); self-nominations are permitted and encouraged. Thanks for participating and please remember to check back for comments on your nomination (consider watchlisting your nomination page). Read these instructions completely before proceeding. For simplified instructions, see User:Rjanag/Quick DYK 2. I. Create the nomination subpage. Enter the article title in the box below and click the button. (To nominate multiple articles together, enter any or all of the article titles.) You will then be taken to a preloaded nomination page. II. Write the nomination. On the nomination page, fill in the relevant information. See Template:NewDYKnomination and {{NewDYKnomination/guide}} for further information. Not every line of the template needs to be filled in. For instance, if you are not nominating an image to appear with your hook, there is no need to fill in the image-related lines. Add an edit summary e.g. "Nominating YOUR ARTICLE TITLE for DYK" and click Publish page. Make sure the nomination page is on your watchlist, so you can follow the review discussion. III. Post at Template talk:Did you know. In the current nominations section find the subsection for the date on which the article was created or on which expansion began (or, if a new Good Article, the date on which it became a GA), not the date on which you make the nomination. At the top of that subsection (before other nominations already there, but below the section head and hidden comment) add {{Did you know nominations/YOUR ARTICLE TITLE}}. Add an edit summary e.g. "Nominating YOUR ARTICLE TITLE for DYK" and click Publish page. Frequently asked questions[edit] How do I write an interesting hook? Successful hooks tend to have several traits. Most importantly, they share a surprising or intriguing fact. They give readers enough context to understand the hook, but leave enough out to make them want to learn more. They are written for a general audience who has no prior knowledge of or interest in the topic area. Lastly, they are concise, and do not attempt to cover multiple facts or present information about the subject beyond what's needed to understand the hook. When will my nomination be reviewed? This page is often backlogged. As long as your submission is still on the page, it will stay there until an editor reviews it. Since editors are encouraged to review the oldest submissions first, it may take several weeks until your submission is reviewed. In the meantime, please consider reviewing another submission (not your own) to help reduce the backlog (see instructions below). Where is my hook? If you can't find the nomination you submitted to this nominations page, it may have been approved and is on the approved nominations page waiting to be promoted. It could also have been added to one of the prep areas, promoted from prep to a queue, or is on the main page. If the nominated hook is in none of those places, then the nomination has probably been rejected. Such a rejection usually only occurs if it was at least a couple of weeks old and had unresolved issues for which any discussion had gone stale. If you think your nomination was unfairly rejected, you can query this on the DYK discussion page, but as a general rule such nominations will only be restored in exceptional circumstances. Instructions for reviewers[edit] Main page: Wikipedia:Did you know/Reviewing guide Any editor who was not involved in writing/expanding or nominating an article may review it by checking to see that the article meets all the DYK criteria (long enough, new enough, no serious editorial or content issues) and the hook is cited. Editors may also alter the suggested hook to improve it, suggest new hooks, or even lend a hand and make edits to the article to which the hook applies so that the hook is supported and accurate. For a more detailed discussion of the DYK rules and review process see the supplementary guidelines and the WP:Did you know/Reviewing guide. To post a comment or review on a DYK nomination, follow the steps outlined below: Look through this page, Template talk:Did you know, to find a nomination you would like to comment on. Click the "Review or comment" link at the top of the nomination. You will be taken to the nomination subpage. The top of the page includes a list of the DYK criteria. Check the article to ensure it meets all the relevant criteria. To indicate the result of the review (i.e., whether the nomination passes, fails, or needs some minor changes), leave a signed comment on the page. Please begin with one of the 5 review symbols that appear at the top of the edit screen, and then indicate all aspects of the article that you have reviewed; your comment should look something like the following: Article length and age are fine, no copyvio or plagiarism concerns, reliable sources are used. But the hook needs to be shortened. If you are the first person to comment on the nomination, there will be a line :* <!-- REPLACE THIS LINE TO WRITE FIRST COMMENT, KEEPING  :* --> showing you where you should put the comment. Save the page. If there is any problem or concern about a nomination, please consider notifying the nominator by placing {{subst:DYKproblem|Article|header=yes|sig=yes}} on the nominator's talk page. Instructions for project members[edit] How to promote an accepted hook[edit] At-a-glance instructions on how to promote an approved hook to a Prep area See Wikipedia:Did you know/Preparation areas for details on verifying a hook's acceptability. Promoters should not promote their own nomination or their own review When promoting hooks intended for a particular date, keep in mind that when the number of available approved nominations exceeds 120 we switch to two sets per day, and when that number drops below 60 we return to one set per day. Check list for nomination review completeness 1) Select a hook from the approved nominations page that has one of these ticks at the bottom post: . 2) Check to make sure basic review requirements were completed. a. Any outstanding issue following needs to be addressed before promoting. 3) Check the article history for any substantive changes since it was nominated or reviewed. 4) Images for the lead slot must be freely licensed. Fair-use images are not permitted. Images loaded on Commons that appear on the Main Page are automatically protected by KrinkleBot. 5) Hook must be stated in both the article and source (which must be cited at the end of the article sentence where stated). 6) Hook should make sense grammatically. 7) Try to vary subject matters within each prep area. 8) Try to select a funny, quirky or otherwise upbeat hook for the last or bottom hook in the set. Steps to add a hook to prep In one tab, open the nomination page of the hook you want to promote. In a second tab, open the prep set you intend to add the hook to. 1) For hooks held for specific dates, refer to "Local update times" section on DYK Queue. a. Completed Prep area number sets will be promoted by an administrator to corresponding Queue number. 2) Copy and paste the hook into a chosen slot. a. Make sure there's a space between ... and that, and a ? at the end. b. Check that there's a bold link to the article. 3) If it's the lead (first) hook, paste the image where indicated at the top of the template. 4) Copy and paste ALL the credit information (the {{DYKmake}} and {{DYKnom}} templates) at the bottom 5) Check your work in the prep's Preview mode. a. At the bottom under "Credits", to the right of each article should have the link "View nom subpage" ; if not, a subpage parameter will need to be added to the DYKmake. 6) Save the Prep page. Closing the DYK nomination page At the upper left Change {{DYKsubpage to {{subst:DYKsubpage Change |passed= to |passed=yes At the bottom Just above the line containing }}<!--Please do not write below this line or remove this line. Place comments above this line.--> insert a new, separate line containing one of the following: To [[T:DYK/P1|Prep 1]] To [[T:DYK/P2|Prep 2]] To [[T:DYK/P3|Prep 3]] To [[T:DYK/P4|Prep 4]] To [[T:DYK/P5|Prep 5]] To [[T:DYK/P6|Prep 6]] To [[T:DYK/P7|Prep 7]] Also paste the same thing into the edit summary. Check in Preview mode. Make sure everything is against a pale blue background (nothing outside) and there are no stray characters, like }}, at the top or bottom. Save. For more information, please see T:TDYK#How to promote an accepted hook. Handy copy sources: To [[T:DYK/P1|Prep 1]] To [[T:DYK/P2|Prep 2]] To [[T:DYK/P3|Prep 3]] To [[T:DYK/P4|Prep 4]] To [[T:DYK/P5|Prep 5]] To [[T:DYK/P6|Prep 6]] To [[T:DYK/P7|Prep 7]] How to remove a rejected hook[edit] Open the DYK nomination subpage of the hook you would like to remove. (It's best to wait several days after a reviewer has rejected the hook, just in case someone contests or the article undergoes a large change.) In the window where the DYK nomination subpage is open, replace the line {{DYKsubpage with {{subst:DYKsubpage, and replace |passed= with |passed=no. Then save the page. This has the effect of wrapping up the discussion on the DYK nomination subpage in a blue archive box and stating that the nomination was unsuccessful, as well as adding the nomination to a category for archival purposes. How to remove a hook from the prep areas or queue[edit] Edit the prep area or queue where the hook is and remove the hook and the credits associated with it. Go to the hook's nomination subpage (there should have been a link to it in the credits section). View the edit history for that page Go back to the last version before the edit where the hook was promoted, and revert to that version to make the nomination active again. Add a new icon on the nomination subpage to cancel the previous tick and leave a comment after it explaining that the hook was removed from the prep area or queue, and why, so that later reviewers are aware of this issue. Add a transclusion of the template back to this page so that reviewers can see it. It goes under the date that it was first created/expanded/listed as a GA. You may need to add back the day header for that date if it had been removed from this page. If you removed the hook from a queue, it is best to either replace it with another hook from one of the prep areas, or to leave a message at WT:DYK asking someone else to do so. How to move a nomination subpage to a new name[edit] Don't; it should not ever be necessary, and will break some links which will later need to be repaired. Even if you change the title of the article, you don't need to move the nomination page. Nominations[edit] Older nominations[edit] Articles created/expanded on September 2[edit] Articles created/expanded on September 27[edit] Roman campaigns in Germania (12 BC – AD 16) ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that the Romans won a series of campaigns against the Germanic tribes following the disaster at Teutoburg, but decided to leave Germany because its land was not considered valuable? Source: Wells (2003), The Battle That Stopped Rome, pp. 206–7 Improved to Good Article status by SpartaN (talk). Self-nominated at 03:34, 29 September 2021 (UTC). General eligibility: New Enough: Y Long Enough: Y Other problems: Y Policy compliance: Adequate sourcing: Y Neutral: Y Free of copyright violations, plagiarism, and close paraphrasing: Y Other problems: Y Hook eligibility: Cited: N - Source is offline but happy to AGF. However, in the article the statement “they considered German lands too poor for annexation” is sourced to p.204 of Wells. pp.206-7 referred to above is used to support that they that “it was too costly in economic and military resources” to go into in Germany. I guess either way the hook is sourced but could you clarify the exact sourcing of the hook. Interesting: Y QPQ: None required. Overall: Interesting thorough article, well-written with good quality sourcing. Earwig shows no issues. Just a minor query around the hook sourcing but otherwise will be good to go. DeCausa (talk) 08:23, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @DeCausa: I found the web link that (for me) shows a preview if you're able to see it: https://books.google.com/books?id=mc30CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA206&lpg=PA206 SpartaN (talk) 10:07, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @SpartaN: Thanks for providing the link. It’s prompted a couple of thoughts for me. Firstly, Wells doesn’t seem to be saying the reason for the withdrawal is definitively known (“… the reasons for these decisions must have lain…”) i.e he’s making an assumption, however well founded. The hook is more definite than Wells is. Secondly, Wells’ emphasis is on the strength of the resistance being behind the reason - the poor value of the territory makes it “not worth it” because of the strength of the resistance. That’s not quite the same as just saying the land wasn’t valuable. (I notice the text you used in the article on this reflects that effort/value ratio issue.) To fix both points would you be prepared to consider an ALT1 which after “…Teutoburg” continues something along the lines of “…likely decided to leave Germany because the military effort was out of proportion to the territory’s value?” although there may need to be some trimming to get it into the 200 character limit. DeCausa (talk) 11:12, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @SpartaN and DeCausa: It's been over a month since the last comments here, have there been any updates? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:31, 13 November 2021 (UTC) From my point of view I’m waiting for SpartaN’s reply to my last post here. But I notice they haven’t edited Wikipedia since then, over a month ago. So I’m not quite sure what can be done. DeCausa (talk) 08:17, 13 November 2021 (UTC) I see. Given that there's really only one issue holding the nomination back, would anyone be willing to adopt this in case SpartaN doesn't return? It would be a shame if the nomination failed at this point. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 06:35, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I’m not sure what exactly are the DYK rules on this but, subject to that, options could be (a) I propose an ALT1 hook and someone else signs it off; (b) someone else proposes an ALT1 hook and I sign it off; (c) if anyone disagrees with me on the original hook I’m happy to step away and they sign it off. DeCausa (talk) 11:04, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I've looked at the Wells source and concur that it is saying the withdrawal was more down to the ratio of effort required to potential reward, and have boldly tweaked the copy in the article to reflect this. For what it's worth, I think ALT1 works just fine. firefly ( t · c ) 11:16, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Ok. I’m just going to formalize the ALT1 and let someone else add the tick and sign off: ALT1:... that the Romans won a series of campaigns against the Germanic tribes after the disaster at Teutoburg but likely decided to leave Germany as the effort was out of proportion to the territory’s value? DeCausa (talk) 12:07, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Since the reviewer has proposed a new hook, another editor will be needed to sign this off. I'm not sure though if the section linking in the bold links is allowed, however. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:29, 15 November 2021 (UTC) sorry, I missed that. It’s not even necessary to link to a section of the article so I’ve taken it out of ALT1. DeCausa (talk) 08:21, 15 November 2021 (UTC) As this doesn’t seem to be moving I’m going to give ALT1 the tick as original reviewer. If the DYK regulars think this is out of process because I came up nwith ALT1 then happy for it to be reverted. DeCausa (talk) 22:46, 21 November 2021 (UTC) DeCausa, there is no rush to approve, and your approval of your own hook was indeed out of process. I have reverted SL93's promotion of the nomination to prep, and with any luck a new reviewer will be around soon enough to review your ALT1. (SL93, you're welcome to review it, but that means you cannot also promote it.) I've also struck the original hook due to the issues noted above. BlueMoonset (talk) 04:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) BlueMoonset Sorry for mixing up who approved it. SL93 (talk) 04:26, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I didn't notice the second sentence of the approval...not sure how that happened. Sorry, again. SL93 (talk) 04:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) DeCausa Reading through the article again, your ALT1 hook seems to be mostly verifed in the Aftermath section, but I'm not seeing any indication of it being "likely". SL93 (talk) 21:14, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, that’s true. Where that came from was, in the above discussion with SpartaN on the original hook, they cited Wells in support. Wells says, in relation to Tiberius’ decision to ‘give up’, that “The reason for these decisions must have lain in the Germans’ tough resistance”. I’ve taken that to mean Wells’ was inferring Tiberius’ reasoning without direct evidence (or certainty) of Tiberius’ actual reason. However, you’re right that the way the article is written is more certain. I’m ok striking the “likely” or, possibly it would be better to amend the final sentence of the first paragraph of the Aftermath section to be more reflectve of Wells. DeCausa (talk) 21:48, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I will leave this here for someone else to look at. It would be helpful if the nominator came back. SL93 (talk) 23:21, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Articles created/expanded on October 9[edit] Pankratius Pfeiffer ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that Salvatorian priest Pankratius Pfeiffer saved hundreds of Jews in Rome during the Second World War? Reviewed: 1936 Northeast Flood Created by Ergo Sum (talk). Self-nominated at 17:52, 9 October 2021 (UTC). New article that was created on 9 October 2021? is 3,212 characters and nominated on the same day. No copyvios detected and duplication detector of [1][2][3][4][5] reveal no close paraphrasing issues (AGF PDF docs which can't go through Dup detector). Article is well-sourced. Hook is 103 characters long (under 200 character max.) and is interesting. Refs 4 and 5 (verifying the hook) are reliable sources. QPQ done. Looks good to go! —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:41, 9 October 2021 (UTC) Too many red flags here. If he really saved hundreds of Jews, you would expect plenty of confirmation of this in scholarly sources and him to be recognized by Yad Vashem. I can't count the number of times that I've seen mainstream newspapers print completely false stories about Jews being rescued during the holocaust, so better sources are definitely needed to confirm these extraordinary claims. Thanks Brigade Piron for letting me know about this. (t · c) buidhe 16:51, 10 October 2021 (UTC) I have to admit I'm just a bit perplexed by the argument. Except in fairly uncommon cases of multiple RS that contradict each other, we don't generally recognize any "hierarchy" of reliable sources. Sources are either RS or they are not. So I'm not sure what kind of sources you have in mind as "better" sources. The ones currently cited in the article are all RS, so that should be the end of it. I might add that if you seek some manner of official imprimatur in the vein of Yad Vashem, the City of Rome named a street after him. Your point about why there isn't more extensive coverage of this historical figure is well taken but can easily be attributed to the fact that all manner of historical figures are lost to history, especially those who are notable really for one major event in their life that did not come to light until years later, as is the case here. Indeed, one of the RS in this article describes Pfeiffer as being "lost to history." I'm adding the new review icon here so that we can get at least one more editor's evaluation of this. Ergo Sum 13:32, 16 October 2021 (UTC) There are very few people who actually saved hundreds of Jews during the Holocaust and plenty of hoaxes that were reported as truth by various news organizations—for example Necdet Kent. In other cases, actual rescue did occur but the numbers are greatly exaggerated and repeated uncritically by news organizations, such as Raoul Wallenberg. If the story is true you would expect to see it covered in many more credible sources. There are plenty of cases where a source is reliable for some info but not others. For example, someone's CV is often reliable for "they worked at X organization" but not "they are a world expert in Z". Extraordinary claims require extraordinary sourcing. (t · c) buidhe 21:27, 16 October 2021 (UTC) I should say that I share Buidhe's concerns. I think saying that "all manner of historical figures are lost to history" rather side-steps the sheer volume of historical scholarship on all aspects of the Holocaust. On a more banal note, I think part of the problem is that the sources cited are, essentially, all journalistic sources published by explicitly Catholic or Salvatorian outlets. The specific sources cited for the "saved" claim are Romereports (I am not familiar with this outlet, but the typo in the video does not inspire confidence) and a self-published Salvatorian newsletter. Neither are scholarly sources and both are, again, explicitly confessional in nature. I think WP:BIASED may on point in a highly sensitive issue touching on the wider disputes about Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust. Do we know what the Samerski book says, for example? —Brigade Piron (talk) 08:55, 17 October 2021 (UTC) Buidhe It is true that the sources cover Catholic issues, but only the Salvatorian one is actually published by a Catholic institution. I need not go into how varied Catholic newspapers are in their adherence/faithfulness to the Catholic hierarchy and beliefs (see e.g. National Catholic Reporter versus National Catholic Register). But more direclty, there actually are many scholarly RS that discussion Pfeiffer and his works in Nazi-occupied Rome. You will find them on the other language versions of this article. The problem is that I do not read Italian or German well enough to use them in the article. Coverage is not the issue. It is English language coverage. Ergo Sum 13:48, 17 October 2021 (UTC) @Ergo Sum: perhaps add the word "reportedly" before "saved". I'm inclined to accept in good faith the sources used as reliable – none of them have not been deprecated nor deemed generally unreliable. —Bloom6132 (talk) 16:41, 26 October 2021 (UTC) DYK should not cover unconfirmed reports or rumors so I strongly disagree with that suggestion. As well as assuming sources are reliable if they've never been discussed at WP:RSN, which disregards important parts of WP:RS such as WP:CONTEXTMATTERS. There is no issue with citing sources in Italian or German, but if it's not confirmed that they support the content then it's incorrect to assume that they do. (t · c) buidhe 20:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Bloom6132: I tend to think that statements are either supported by RS and written in wikivoice or they're not accepted at all. For that reason, I shy away from words like "reportedly." I reiterate though that I think it's quite clear there's nothing wrong with the sources currently used. They're all RS, so that should be the end of it. Hence, why I think your initial review was satisfactory. Ergo Sum 23:40, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Ergo Sum: agreed. I'm still of the view that the hook satisfies criteria 3b. Criteria 4 states that "Nominations should be rejected if an inspection reveals that they are not based on reliable sources". That is not the case here. —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) You're still ignoring the principle in RS that context matters, and some sources are reliable for some but not other info. The two of us who actually write on Holocaust related topics have expressed that the sources cited are not reliable for the exceptional claims being made. (t · c) buidhe 23:59, 26 October 2021 (UTC) With all due respect, I am of the opinion that the sources used are reliable for the info in the hook. The fact that you and Brigade Piron write on Holocaust-related topics is irrelevant – it does not confer a veto over hooks pertaining to that subject. By that logic, I should be able to veto baseball or heraldry hooks ... —Bloom6132 (talk) 01:10, 27 October 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: Three of my DYKs promoted (including Coat of arms of the Falkland Islands from August this year) have included the word "reportedly" in the hook, as well as numerous hooks from other editors. Disagree all you want – this is accepted practice at DYK. —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: I'm aware that you have experience writing about Holocaust-related articles and I put value in your assessment as a solid editor. However, I'm quite comfortable in my ability to vet RS, as well, and my confidence in these sources means I must disagree with your opinion here. Experienced editors do disagree at times, and it is my opinion that I think you have gotten this one wrong; doubtless, you think the same for me. I haven't seen any evidence that these are not RS. Therefore, I recommend if Bloom6132 is inclined to do so, to renew their approval of the hook. In the meantime, I'm going to request the input of additional experienced editors on the DYK talk page. Ergo Sum 01:28, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm going to ping @Bamse, Bermicourt, Jmabel, and Anyfile to see if we can find some reliable sources in other languages. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 01:46, 27 October 2021 (UTC) Oops, @AnyFile theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 01:47, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm currently traveling & very busy, so not much help here, I'm afraid. - Jmabel | Talk 01:53, 27 October 2021 (UTC) That said, more or less this same case is made in The Pope's Jews: The Vatican's Secret Plan to Save Jews from the Nazis by Gordon Thomas (not currently cited in the article). - Jmabel | Talk 02:00, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm unclear as to why the cited sources are unreliable: are we assuming that all information emanating from a Roman Catholic source is unreliable? If so what's the logic? In any case there are dozens of book sources in English, German, French and Italian that mention Pfeiffer, the problem is that few are accessible online. One is an entire biography of Pfeiffer "from baker to Vatican diplomat" which would be useful to track down: Willer, Philomena (2005). P. Pankratius Pfeiffer SDS: (1872-1945); vom Bäckergesellen zum Vatikandiplomat. Pub: Josef Fink. Others that mentions Pfeiffer and the Jews in Rome are: Liebhart (1996) Schwangau. Meding (1992), Flucht vor Nürnberg. Sinn (1976), Illegal. Bermicourt (talk) 08:41, 27 October 2021 (UTC) My issue is with the unreliability of journalistic works and popular history, which have in many cases published inaccurate information about rescues of Jews during the Holocaust. If better sources exist, they should be cited instead. An additional question is, do these sources actually support the claim of "hundreds" of Jews rescued by Pfeiffer personally? (t · c) buidhe 08:51, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I've now found sources that cover most of the article. Here are more: Liebhart (1996) Schwangau. Meding (1992), Flucht vor Nürnberg. Sinn (1976), Illegal. Prince Constantine of Bavaria (1952) Der Papst. Layer (1985), Schwäbisches Ehrenbuch - Pfeiffer credited with "saving Rome and other Italian cities including Chieti, Ascoli and Ovieto from destruction and other calamities" _ (1999). Publik-Forum - Pfeiffer the only German to have a street named after him in Rome and who fought to save Roman Jews. _ (1960). Bayerische Frömmigkeit - Pfeiffer described as the "Saviour of Rome and other cities in Italy" Robert Katz has written a number of books - Death in Rome (1967), Black Sabbath (1969), The Battle for Rome (2010) - which all mention Pfeiffer. Bottum and Dalin (2004). The Pius War has this interesting piece: "7. Pancrazio [sic] Pfeiffer. According to Carroll-Abbing, one of the men used by Pius XII to protest the Nazi roundup of Rome's Jews and intervene for persecuted victims was Father Pancrazio Pfeiffer, superior general of the Salvatorian Fathers, who also served as Pius XII' personal liaison to the German military command in Rome. Because Pfeiffer died tragically in an automobile accident toward the end of the war and thus never took part in the postwar analysis of Pius XII's conduct, many historians have overlooked him. But those who knew him or have researched his life have chronicled his collaborative efforts with Pius XII to rescue Jews and others during the war. See the article "Pfeiffer's List" by Robert Graham, 30 Days, June 1994, pp. 42-46. Prince Constantine of Bavaria's book on Pius XII, The Pope (London: Allan Wingate, 1954) [listed above] contains an excellent section on Pfeiffer, whom he describes as an agent for the pope on behalf of the victims of persecution and the fugitives in hiding" (p. 213). At Pfeiffer's death in May 1945, Vatican Radio paid tribute: "He came into contact with the Commander of the German occupying forces [in Rome in 1943-44]. From that day onwards, he placed his religious and spiritual qualities at the service of many who had been arrested or already condemned to death. He helped countless people in this way, and saved their lives, among them many Jews and other Italian personages. He championed..." In short there seems to be book evidence for virtually everything stated in the article apart from the specific details of the two incidents where 249 or 400 Jews were rescued. Based on my initial searches my expectation is that those incidents are likely to be recorded in the literature - we just need to be able to access more of the sources. Meanwhile there is no harm in pausing to use some of the above sources, plus those I've added to the Further reading section of the article in order to reinforce the existing references and then review where we are.

For example, Salvatorians USA Province is not independent of the article subject and therefore is not reliable for self-serving assertions such as "he saved many Jews in Rome from persecution and ultimately death" or "Every day, Pfeiffer visited the Regina Coeli prison and another prison on Via Tasso, where he would often return with freed prisoners who had been sentenced to death." (t · c) buidhe 08:27, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: would you still object if the article instead relied on the sources found by Bermicourt? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 04:58, 5 November 2021 (UTC) Depends, the Samerski source looks reliable to me but the book published by "Österreichische Provinz der Salvatorianer" has the same issue of close connection to the article subject. (t · c) buidhe 06:27, 5 November 2021 (UTC) All right. @Ergo Sum: I'm not going to promote the nomination without consensus to move forward, so if you want to try and rework the article's sourcing to approval, that can work.

Ergo Sum 15:45, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I have added several inline citations to the article, which refer to sources that were (very helpfully) added by Bermicourt. These sources support several of the very specific claims in the article, as well as the general thrust of the article which is in dispute here, namely that Pfeiffer was a liaison and in that capacity saved many Jews and others from the Nazis. In light of these reliable sources supporting the general claims, I think any concern about the pre-existing ones describing some of his more specific actions is ameliorated. There is a trove of additional sources in the Further Reading section that additionally describe in much greater detail Pfeiffer's actions but they are either in a foreign language which I do not adequately read to make use of as citations or are offline. All being said, I think there is now ample sourcing to back up the article's claims. Ergo Sum 05:49, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks, Ergo Sum—@Buidhe:, if this sourcing is up to your standards, we can move ahead. If not, we're probably going back to WT:DYK and asking for more eyes. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 05:52, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Hi, I've flagged the specific content in the article that supports the hook as needing a better source. There are other active cleanup tags on the article as well. However, I think there's sufficient sourcing for a modified version of the hook without the words "hundreds of". (t · c) buidhe 06:06, 17 November 2021 (UTC) We could cite "countless" using the ref above instead of "hundreds of". Bermicourt (talk) 08:33, 17 November 2021 (UTC) According to the source it's what Vatican Radio said about him after his death. DYK is not for eulogies imo. (t · c) buidhe 08:37, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I'm not following—is the source unreliable because it's after his death? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 08:40, 17 November 2021 (UTC) No, it's because it's Catholic presumably... We could always add "according to Vatican Radio..." But better still, we just need to cite the exact text from one of the many non-Catholic book sources and the problem will be solved. Bermicourt (talk) 08:46, 17 November 2021 (UTC) And yet another source: O'Reilly (2001) in Forgotten Battles: Italy's War of Liberation 1943-45 states that "the Vatican was able to assist many of Rome's Jews and others sought by the Germans through Father Pancrazio Pfeiffer's intervention with the Germans... His work was recounted by Robert Graham who has written extensively on the Vatican's role in World War II." Bermicourt (talk) 09:01, 17 November 2021 (UTC) And another: Bartley (2016) in Catholics Confronting Hitler states that "Father Pancrace [sic] Pfeiffer, a German priest and the superior general of the Salvatorian Order, was the pope's liaison with the German military. Several hundred hostages, including some under sentence of death, owed their release to the efficacious intervention of Father Pfeiffer." I don't know why I'm doing this - you can look up the references yourselves instead of opining and speculating from the sidelines in the classic Wikipedia way. :) Bermicourt (talk) 09:08, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @Bermicourt: Since it seems you have access to several sources that I do not (probably just requires further digging), would you want to add them as inline citations with page numbers, especially to support the proposition regarding hundreds of people saved?

I'd be in favor instead of the hook being split into two separate proposals: one hook about the fact that she was an internet celebrity who grew up in a place without tap water, and a separate hook about her going viral for making hamburgers. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:23, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Full review needed, which can also address the issue of the borderline ALT1 hook. BlueMoonset (talk) 04:23, 5 November 2021 (UTC) As far as I can tell the article meets DYK requirements, and a QPQ has been done. Earwigs finds a close match with Coda Media, but that's only because it was the source for quotes in the article, and all of them are properly referenced. I find the first hook hard to believe given China's international standing, and in any case as brought up by Bowlhover may be inaccurate anyway. As for the second hook, as I mentioned before it's ineligible as it's exactly 200 characters long, and per WP:DYK hooks that are at or shorter than 200 characters may be rejected per reviewer's discretion. Both ALT0 and ALT1 have struck: I am repeating my earlier suggestion that ALT1 instead be split into two separate hooks. As this is a China-related article and there appear to be some political discussion in the article, I'd also like to ask for a second opinion from someone more knowledgeable about China-related articles if the article doesn't fall afoul of relevant guidelines. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 13:12, 6 November 2021 (UTC) From Wikipedia:Did you know#The hook: The hook should be concise: no more than about 200 characters (including spaces and the question mark, but not including the ..., the space immediately following the ..., or any (pictured)). While 200 is a hard limit, hooks near or at this limit may still be rejected at the discretion of reviewers and administrators. This tool can be used for counting words. The guideline says that "200 is a hard limit", so it is not true that the 200-character ALT1 hook is "ineligible" or "simply too long". No reason has been given for rejecting a 200-character hook "at the discretion of reviewers". Here are two additional hooks based on the suggestion: ALT2: ... that Dianxi Xiaoge, who grew up in a remote Yunnan mountain without running water, is an Internet celebrity with roughly 16 million subscribers on all her platforms? ALT3: ... Dianxi Xiaoge went viral in China and internationally after making hamburgers for her grandparents who had never eaten them before? Cunard (talk) 07:48, 7 November 2021 (UTC) Well for one thing, the original was very difficult to read and seemed to combine too many facts into one hook. Usually DYK prefers simpler hooks whenever possible. In any case, I think ALT3 is the best hook here and the nomination is otherwise good to go, I'd just like to hear a second opinion from another editor on the article tone given that I'm a bit uncomfortable doing a solo review here given the "Commentary" section delves into some political matters. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:36, 7 November 2021 (UTC) On second thought, I have some concerns regarding the length of the article. Isn't it rather detailed for an internet celebrity's page? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 11:10, 7 November 2021 (UTC) That the article is "rather detailed for an internet celebrity's page" should not be a concern. The sources provided substantial analysis of her and her work, and this article reflects those sources. Other detailed articles for Internet celebrities include PewDiePie and MrBeast. Cunard (talk) 11:18, 7 November 2021 (UTC) Pinging Gatoclass for his input, as he responded to a discussion I raised about this nomination over at WT:DYK. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:57, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I don't think we need Gatoclass to restate themself. Here's what they said at WT:DYK: The article doesn't use the phrase "one of only three Chinese influencers to gain international influence", so I'm not sure where you got that, but it does say she is one of only three "Chinese Internet celebrities who have reached international prominence", and the problem with that claim is that it's sourced to an article that is two years old and therefore not up-to-date. With regard to the overall length, I would agree that it is overly detailed and could use a trim. I'm not sure this is relevant to DYK however, as "overly detailed" is not one of our criteria. What I would say is that the level of detail does raise the chances of close paraphrasing so the article would need to be carefully checked for that. Anybody else with an opinion on this article?

Thriley (talk) 20:57, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @Thriley: I'll ping BlueMoonset here in case I'm wrong, but I'm going to say no, it isn't. My reasoning here is that if the hook were read as plaintext, without any bolding or linking, it would be read as pretty much only interesting as it concerns the plot. The hook should concern Smit's life; if it concerns her work as an actress, only stating her role and not anything about production doesn't make the hook out-of-universe. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 21:28, 17 November 2021 (UTC) theleekycauldron, I was taking a look at the ALT1 hook and its sources, and the second Biography sentence is basically copied from Esquire—the Google translate version, at any rate. That's a problem. Another problem is that the source doesn't actually say that she was working as a hotel receptionist when she got the call, just that it was "one of these jobs", referring back to the four in the previous sentence, none of which were hotel receptionist. The article also needs a bit of copyediting. I don't think that either of the plot-based hooks should be used, and as Drmies notes, "first film" is not accurate, since it's Cross the Line that's in the source, which appears to be her fifth film. We could only use "first feature film" if the previous four in her filmography were all short films (which would need to be clearly sourced). Perhaps an angle for the information in ALT1 would be to say she was working in whatever job it was when she was cast in Cross the Line, for which she was nominated as best new actress in the Goya Awards. BlueMoonset (talk) 02:31, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Here’s an article that states she was working as a receptionist two years before she was hired to work on Parallel Mothers:[6] Does it appear reliable? Thriley (talk) 05:38, 20 November 2021 (UTC) I don't see a reason to doubt the source. However, it isn't sufficient to support the "when she was called" hook claim, just that she was a hotel receptionist two years before the article was written (and possibly two years and a number of months, since you can't assume it's exactly two years). BlueMoonset (talk) 17:14, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Perhaps the hook should include all her various jobs before her Almodovar role? Thriley (talk) 01:47, 23 November 2021 (UTC) ALT3 “before starring in the Pedro Almodóvar film Parallel Mothers, Milena Smit worked as a model, waitress, shop assistant, babysitter, teleoperator, subway information assistant, and hotel receptionist?” El País Thriley (talk) 01:51, 23 November 2021 (UTC) That hook is 197 characters which puts it in discretionary territory. Given though that the hookiness here is that she did all of these non-acting jobs, I think in this case the length is justified since it hasn't reached the limit.

I do like the hooks and it's an intriguing subject for an article! I wanted to flag the following comments, in case they are helpful (please ignore if not!): I don't quite follow this sentence in the lead: "Moreover, it is still pointed out that the emendation Albruna agrees with the names of other Germanic wise women." Should "instriptions" (before the Drusus heading) be "inscriptions"? Should the names of scholars be wikilinked, where there is a page for the author (e.g. Simek)? What does mss mean, and could this be explained when it is first referenced? The second paragraph of the Aurinia section has two sentences starting with "However" in a row, which is a bit awkward to read.

To be expected, since they're cited almost 20 times each, and since the vast majority of the matches concern long quotes I'm willing to overlook it, but can we add more citations throughout the paragraphs? Particularly with "Conflict with Miles and Reynolds", there's four citations crammed at the end of the section. I think we should cite each after the corresponding sentences, especially where there's a direct quotation. Also for ALT0 we need a citation at the ends of the sentences for "Golden Boy" and "Whiz Kid". Otherwise nice read, and good use of sources.

Its long enough and new and lots of good refs - including the hook fact. It documents a notable woman from the 14th century and there were not many of those.

Nice addition. well done Victuallers (talk) 10:31, 6 November 2021 (UTC) Reopening this because I think the hook is misleading, as according to the source it was usual for women of the nobility, like Neville, to sign with their own names. Gatoclass (talk) 02:10, 19 November 2021 (UTC) @Gatoclass: I don't think most will know that, so maybe we go with ALT1 or some variation on it? We don't need to say it's unusual if we phrase it that way theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 02:14, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Theleekycauldron, the problem with both hooks is that they imply that there was something out-of-the-ordinary in a woman signing something in her own name in that era, whereas the source indicates that was normal practice for women of the nobility. So the hooks are misleading. Gatoclass (talk) 02:19, 19 November 2021 (UTC) All right—I'll ping @Lajmmoore and Victuallers: back here, y'all can work this out. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 02:33, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Was it usual for women in the fourteenth century to sign with their own name ... no. Is is usual for women in the 21st century to sign with just their first name? No. So "did you know that unusually Canada's head of state signs documents with just her first name and an R for Regina?" (Someone shouts) "BUT all British Queens do that!!" (Someone shouts) "That implies that it was unusual for Queens to sign with just their first name." No it doesnt. I think @Gatoclass: is reading the source and then saying that the hook doesnt explain every piece of information in the source... which obviously it doesnt. Its unusual that "a woman" is doing this at all. It WAS unusual for women in the fourteenth century to sign and if they did then they did not usually use just their own name. Its a fact - its unusual. Did You know that women did not sign their own names on documents in the 14th century? No I didnt. That is something that Lajmmoore wrote about and now I know. Thanks. Victuallers (talk) 08:28, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Hello Gatoclass all so the part of the source I was using is this, which is talking about signatures for charitable donation "Although most of the widows declare themselves to be the wife of their late husband, or their father's daughter, others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names, such as 'domina Margareta de Longvl' and 'don-ýina Margareta de Nevill' (the same person). The majority of widows declare that their marital status and their power to act, using a variety of phrases, including 'in pura viduitate', 'in pura viduitate mea et ligia potestate', and 'in viduitate mea propria et potestate legitima' ..." and I read that as it was more usual for (noble) women to use a signature that described them as "wife of, etc..." I read the passage as Legg using Margaret de Neville as an unusual example. Legg is talking about the Coucher Book signatures specifically, but I still think they are marking out unusual practice. In terms of the hook, I wonder whether changing 'woman' to 'literate woman' might work? Lajmmoore (talk) 09:32, 19 November 2021 (UTC) No, it wouldn't work just to add "literate". And your reading of the text just amounts to an unsupported assumption on your part. Because while the text could admittedly be less ambiguous, the statement that others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names does not in any way suggest that it was rare or unusual for a member of the nobility to give their name, it only states that members of the nobility as a class were inclined to give their names. So there isn't sufficient support in that statement for a hook which implies that Neville's act was in any way unusual for a member of her class. The hook makes Neville sound like some sort of proto-feminist who boldly challenged the system, when the underlying source only indicates that either her entire class did the same thing, or at least that it was an accepted practice for members of the nobility. So I still think that either the hook needs to be substantially reworked to more closely reflect the source, or a new hook be found. Gatoclass (talk) 02:53, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks for sharing your interpretation of your text Gatoclass. My interpretation (& so the hook) is based on Legg's use of the word most - in that "most of the widows declare themselves to be the wife of their late husband, or their father's daughter" and you rightly point out "others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names" but I think that needs to be balanced by the "most" earlier in the sentence i.e. for women generally, they don't give their name, but some noble women do but overall, for women signing their name, it is unusual enough to be pointed out in the text.

Whispyhistory (talk) 04:04, 13 November 2021 (UTC) @Whispyhistory: But that would be impossible, the article can't possibly mention IP addresses, it's about broken toes.

It's okay with me if allowed (dyk says hook needs to be in article and in the following ref). Whispyhistory (talk) 06:32, 13 November 2021 (UTC) I don't see that exact sequence of numbers in the source, although there are others that look a bit like an IP address. The trouble is, the nominator seems to be the source for it looking a bit like an IP address, which it does, but we can't use that unless the source makes a similar point, which it does not appear to do. Something like this might work (numbers might need to be changed as mentioned): ALT1 ... that a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone may be described as 88.5.3.2? Philafrenzy (talk) 10:16, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Regarding the image, it's a fun idea but I don't think we run images as quizzes and the image is simply a skeletal foot, and not closely enough related to the hook.

I don't see how the hook you're suggesting is hooky. What exactly is wrong with the hook proposed? It's in the article and it's supported by the sources cited. And the image is directly related to the hook. It engages the reader into a spotting game. Dr. Vogel (talk) 14:57, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Like everyone else, I rather like the IP-address hook. If we wikilinked IP address, it would be supported in the linked articles, and fulfill the requirement that anyone following the links will be able to verify the hook. I don't think we need sourcing that says that a specific sequence of numbers is an IP address, as we have sources giving the general format of an IP address, and creating an example would be a trivial calculation ("Are all four of these numbers separated by periods in the range 0-255?"): "IPv4 and IPv6 address formats". www.ibm.com. An IPv4 address has the following format: x . x . x . x where x is called an octet and must be a decimal value between 0 and 255. Octets are separated by periods. An IPv4 address must contain three periods and four octets. The following examples are valid IPv4 addresses: 1 . 2 . 3 . 4 01 . 102 . 103 . 104 This hook is better than any alternative I can think of, and I don't see anything likely to be problematic about it (it's certainly verifiable). I think we might be in agreement on that? So if some rule technically prohibits it, we might have a good case for applying the WP:Ignore all the rules policy. Broken finger is also currently DYK-eligible and I think it uses the same numbering scheme.[1] HLHJ (talk) 02:07, 14 November 2021 (UTC) [edit: add fulltext url] I don't necessarily agree with the reading of WP:DYKCRIT 3b ( Each fact in the hook must be supported in the article by at least one inline citation to a reliable source [...]) that says that the IP thing needs to be in the article (compare e.g. Template:Did you know nominations/Urine deflector, which similarly took some creative licence in how the proposed hooks were phrased beyond what was stated in either the article or the cited source), and I agree with HLHJ that WP:IAR would be applicable regardless. As for the hooks themselves, writing "a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone may be described as 88.5.3.2" is a much poorer way of writing the hook (less "hooky") than the converse, i.e. "88.5.3.2 may refer to a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone". TompaDompa (talk) 11:28, 14 November 2021 (UTC) This. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 17:01, 16 November 2021 (UTC) We can't use IP address because the nominator just thought it up "oh, that looks like an IP address". It's not in the source as the nominator admits and therefore is not verifiable. And so what if it does look like an IP address? What does that tell us about broken toes? I like clever or quirky hooks and have written many (if I may say so), but they have to be based on something in the sources otherwise it's things made up one day. Philafrenzy (talk) 10:19, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you for all your comments. This is not the place to ignore all rules. The proposed hook is not supported by the source given in the article. I am inclined to approve ALT1 but it needs checking, unless another hook is proposed. Whispyhistory (talk) 15:11, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Oh dear, this has become contentious. I think the contended question is whether it's acceptable to have verified information not found in the nominated article, but only in another article, linked in the hook. Not as hooky, but for illustration: ALT3 ... that the dot-decimal notation string "88.5.3.2" is not only an an IPv4 address, but also a fracture in the middle of the bone at the tip of the little toe? "IPv4 and IPv6 address formats". www.ibm.com., Hallux proximal phalanx fracture in adults: an overlooked diagnosis I don't think we're debating whether the IP-address-hook statement is verifiable. The statement that "88.5.3.2" (and any number in that format) is a valid IPv4 address is supported by the IP address article and the IPv4 article, and this format is the subject of the Dot-decimal notation article. No-one had bothered to cite those statements in those articles, but since they've been challenged here, I've now cited them. So "88.5.3.2 is both an IP address[1] and a code for a broken toebone[2]" is certainly verifiable, and is now verified on Wikipedia. Any DYK reader should have no trouble verifying that the hook is accurate. Alternatives that do not mention IP addressees are not as hooky, but don't contain more information about broken toes: ALT4 ... that "88.5.3.2" is a toe fracture in the middle of the bone at the tip of the little toe, while a "78.5.3.2" is the parallel broken finger?

Philafrenzy (talk) 19:25, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you Philafrenzy ( a very experienced DYK contributor) for your efforts in helping new editors understand DYK. Your comment higher up about "88.5.3.2" and "ip address" not being in the source is true and I am grateful for your suggested alts. Essentially, the initial and subsequent hooks sound good, but none are in the article or the source. I don't wish for personal comments and don't mind if someone else wishes to take over here. With due respect @DrVogel: and @HLHJ:...You may wish to take this up at Wikipedia talk:Did you know. Whispyhistory (talk) 10:41, 15 November 2021 (UTC) I won't say I wish I hadn't written the article; I hope it's useful enough to make up for the social harm to the project here. I don't think the hostility was intended by anyone; I suspect that it's felt partly due to the ease of mininterpretation in a text-only medium and partly due to human cognitive biases.[2] I certainly did, and do, not intend it. I spent a day's editing trying to resolve the conflict by finding references specifically saying that the two things were in notation X and adding that text to the article, but unfortunately non-inductive descriptions of the notations seem to have been considered so needless that an Internet RFC attempting to formalize them died of disinterest. I did find a source that explicitly defines the IPv4 format, and one that explicitly says that 88.1.2.2 is a specific fracture, and I've cited the latter in the article, but I don't think this helps. It is probably a bit unreasonable to expect a reviewer to do more than apply rules as best they can, and Wikipedia talk:Did you know might indeed be a better forum for a more detailed discussion. I don't really want to take part in one, though (nothing to do with this discussion, prior reasons). I posted because I felt responsible for the conflict and thought I might be able to help. My impression is that I made it worse; my apologies to everyone I've offended. HLHJ (talk) 03:41, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Nobody is offended, but if I may say so I think you are still missing the point. IP addresses have nothing to do with broken toes even if that notation may have a similarity. That's why the sources don't make the comparison and why the IP-based hooks are no good. Any of the other hooks might be fine (I haven't checked the numbers) just without the bit about IP addresses. The whole thing reminds me of unusually shaped vegetables where you may see a carrot shaped like a foot, people who see faces in clouds, and even apophenia. My personal observation that one thing looks a bit like another is not the basis for a hook unless reliable sources make the point too. Philafrenzy (talk) 09:09, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Folks, we are wasting a wonderful hook. Really. IP addresses have nothing to do with broken toes even if that notation may have a similarity and that is the whole point of making good hooks. They are supposed to be short, punchy, catchy, and likely to draw the readers in to wanting to read the article – as long as they don't misstate the article content. And one of the best recipes to make a hook good is to make it sound counterintuitive With any other option but the original, we are bound to receive another hook frequented by maybe a few hundred visitors. I would propose something to the tune of in some contexts, 88.5.3.2 might not mean an IP address but a broken bone in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone? so that no one claims here that we somehow delegitimise the IP address but at the same time so that we preserve the core of the hook. As for the claims that because the hook is not cited in the IP part, it can't be there - please don't be that pedantic. In our today's world of informatics we may assume that people who visit Wikipedia more or less imagine what IP addresses are, and may more or less imagine how they look like (in the worst case they will visit the article for details). The other part is cited. I see no problem with the original. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 17:01, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Szmenderowiecki I admit that I'm not very familiar with the topic, and the above discussion was confusing, but is the "this isn't an IP address" claim actually in the source? Because if it's not, then no matter how good the hook proposal is, it can't be used in a hook since hook facts need to be based on a reference. Also, I'm pretty sure that assumptions don't count as sources. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:31, 17 November 2021 (UTC) What I was leading is that we don't need to cite that the sky is blue, or that we have five fingers; or that there exist IP addresses for that matter.

We're allowed to. This is not a massive occasion where we can save the whole project by breaking the rules. Its a trivial example of what some (not all) think may be a breach in the rules, with a small, but amusing, advantage. So I'm not asking the defenders of the rules to admit that this is not a breech ... I am suggesting that they might just concede that the harm done by allowing this hook might not offend anyone ... and it might please a few thousand. Victuallers (talk) 15:28, 20 November 2021 (UTC) We don't need to break the rules. The observation that the notation looks a bit like an IP address is trivial and completely unrelated to broken toes. There are already perfectly good hooks above that work better. Nobody is saying don't use the numbers, just strike the bit about IP addresses. The originally proposed hook is not the work of comic genius and cleverness that some seem to think it is. Philafrenzy (talk) 21:58, 20 November 2021 (UTC) The main issue here is that it's one of the core rules of DYK that hook facts must be mentioned in the article, ideally explicitly or at least implied by supporting information. The thing is that at the moment, IP addresses are not mentioned anywhere in the article, so the hooks using the IP address angle would be ineligible according to that criterion anyway. Even April Fools hooks, which tend to be misleading, are still generally based on hook facts that are mentioned in the respective articles. So if we can't even grant IAR exemptions for that criterion for AFD hooks, the one day of the year where our hooks tend to follow the rules most loosely, I can't see why such a request should be granted here.

Nominated by Victuallers (talk) at 16:21, 6 November 2021 (UTC). Article is new enough. Two correct writers are credited. The article is fully referenced. No copyvio detected. There is a bit of biased POV pushing in Wikipedia voice: "most vulnerable to climate change". This will be something our subject is saying no doubt. And this idea is also reflected in the hook with "endangered". The hook content is referenced and confirmed by the Guardian, apart from the "endangered" bit, which opinion is attributed to Tina Stege. So I suggest that "endangered" is taken out of the hook, or it is reworded so it is clear she is saying that. Hook alt1 is unsuitable as it does not link the article and I cannot tell what it is trying to say in relation to the subject. I can confirm image is CC-BY-3.0 as derived from the video with CC-BY-3.0 license. However I would suggest that a different image is selected from the video, perhaps near the end where the microphone is not obscuring her chin. QPQ is done. Graeme Bartlett (talk) 06:03, 15 November 2021 (UTC) @Graeme Bartlett: Thanks for the review Graeme - I have recut a new image. Surprised that "endangered" wasn't referenced. I'm not sure it is just her opinion -"Projected sea level rise would mean 40% of the buildings in the Marshall Islands’ capital of Majuro would be permanently flooded and entire islands would disappear, potentially costing the Pacific country its status as a nation, according to a devastating new report from the World Bank." is a quote from the reference I have added to balance the idea that "endangered" might by pov.

Graeme Bartlett (talk) 20:56, 22 November 2021 (UTC) @Graeme Bartlett: Are you suggesting that we imply that "endangered" is her opinion despite the fact that she represents a nation and the "endangered" aspect is supported by the World Bank and the Guardian newspaper (and the 1bn people estimated to be part of the "High Ambition" group ) saying so? Is there any evidence that is just her opinion and not that of her country and the World Bank? Am I missing something? It you feel you need to give this "a cross" then can I suggest that we ask for a new reviewer?I have suggested an alt that does not use the endangered word.

Self-nominated at 23:51, 4 November 2021 (UTC). @DferDaisy: This article is about 3300 bytes, and was nominated for DYK shortly after creation, satisfying date and length criteria. There is a factual error, as the article states she was interred in Keokuk, Illinois, but the source says she died in Chicago, Illinois and was interred in Keokuk, Iowa. I am assuming good faith for a few references I cannot access (for example, ref 15 - The National Humane Review), which for me gives a landing page for the document, instead of an inside view). Otherwise, everything is properly sourced and there are no copyvio or close paraphrasing concerns (Earwig cites 3 potential problems, but they are not an issue here.) QPQ not required. Regarding the hooks, ALT0 is incorrect as stated, as it reads as if the study was conducted in the early 1900s by Meigs Crowder, whereas she published it in 1917 based on studies from that period. It'll need minor alteration. ALT1 is fine and sourced. I would prefer to promote an amended ALT0. A minor quibble, though not an issue for DYK: please add page numbers for cited sources. If online access is eliminated from the sources, it'll force anyone investigating those sources to wade through too many pages to find the desired detail.

AleatoryPonderings (???) (!!!) 01:52, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @AleatoryPonderings: Yes, but note that this court case is the "leading case with respect to the issue of common employers", establishing a precedent in Canadian law. At the time the lawsuit was filed, this was not the case, and in fact the trial judge ruled against Alouche (see last paragraph of background section); it was only after the case was brought to the Court of Appeal for Ontario that the "common employer doctrine" was established, and it became entrenched when leave to appeal the decision at the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed. Mindmatrix 15:11, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Ah, so the idea behind the hook is that, since Downtown Eatery changed the law on common employers, before Downtown Eatery Best Beaver would not have been Alouche's employer? That makes more sense. AleatoryPonderings (???) (!!!) 15:20, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: I'm going to inspect this again... Mindmatrix 15:18, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @AleatoryPonderings: Alright, so to ensure everything is correct, the following timeline occurred: Alouche was hired to be manager at For Your Eyes Only (owned by Grad and Grosman), and began work on 29 December 1992 Alouche was sent a Notice of Discipline in May 1993, and was fired on 15 June 1993 In October 1993, Alouche filed action for wrongful dismissal against Best Beaver Management Inc., as that was the source of his paycheques Best Beaver ceased operations in mid-1996, and all assets distributed to other companies owned by Grad and Grosman The trial resolved in favour of Alouche Best Beaver did not pay out the judgement (all its assets had been redistributed) Sherriffs were dispatched to For Your Eyes Only, where they seized $1,855 Downtown Eatery filed claim against Alouche, stating the cash belonged to it Alouche defended, and counterclaimed against Grad, Grosman, and all companies they controlled on the grounds of common employer doctrine, the oppression remedy of the Ontario Business Corporations Act, and fraudulent conveyance the judge in the second trial (at Ontario Superior Court of Justice) ruled against Alouche the case was brought to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, where the previous ruling was overturned in 2001 in January 2002, an application for leave to appeal the decision at the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed So, the common employer doctrine was part of the second trial as a counterclaim to the suit filed by Downtown Eatery. I just wanted to ensure this satisfies your concerns. Mindmatrix 18:25, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks for this incredibly thorough response. My concern is maybe philosophical or definitional. If I say that company A employs person B, that has an ordinary meaning and a legal meaning. It is probably right that Best Beaver did not employ Alouche in the ordinary sense of "employ", because Best Beaver was a "paymaster" and not the name on the front of the building where he went to work. My reading of the case itself is that, before Downtown Eatery, it was at best indeterminate as a legal matter whether Best Beaver, alone or in combination with its affiliate companies, employed Alouche. After Downtown Eatery, it was established—as a matter of legal meaning, but not necessarily ordinary meaning—that Best Beaver was his employer, or part of his employer, or something like that. The reason I brought this up is that it's not clear how one could verify the claim that "Best Beaver was not Alouche's employer", because that claim might be true as a matter of ordinary meaning but the only authoritative legal ruling we have on this (namely, Downtown Eatery) holds that the claim is false. In any event, I'll leave this to the eventual reviewer to sort out. I find my brain twisting into knots. AleatoryPonderings (???)

However, it includes a WP:IMDB source and I am unsure about the reliability of several other sources, including Film Ink, Queer Media Matters, Antaeus.org, Fern TV, Addicted to Horror Movies, Dan's Papers, Go Mag, Three Women in a Box and North Coast Rep. To add to that, the YouTube link does not appear to be uploaded by an official channel, making it unreliable. Additionally, per MOS:FILMCAST uncredited roles need a source. the copyvio checker showed up a 50%+ similarity with a source, which may suggest over quotation. On top of that, the subject has unclear notability. I'm unsure which roles are significant and The House on Pine Street appears to have a questionable notability. None of her awards seem significant and I'm not seeing any significant coverage from reliable, independent sources. ALT0 isn't very interesting given the festival is not significant enough to have an article. I think ALT1 is interesting but it seems to focus more on the character, not the actress which isn't exactly ideal... QPQ not needed. We'll need some work but we'll get there!

Thanks, DanCherek. while the article is over 1,500 prose characters, I'm going to be a stickler and say that this is still a stub.

Moving on, the article was created from a redir and nominated in time and is neutral, although I'm requesting a second opinion on the sourcing. The article seems to be plagiarism free, and a QPQ has been done. As for the hook, I'm not sure it quite checks out—is the church expected to break away?

Once we clear those two up, we're good to go. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 02:41, 21 November 2021 (UTC) @Theleekycauldron: Not entirely sure what the concern on the sourcing is; there are multiple reputable sources.

Thanks! ~ Pbritti (talk) 05:10, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Isn't there a difference between "planned" (alt1) and "expected" (alt0)? planned implies it may or may not happen, expected is like forecasting—at least, that's how i read it. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 05:19, 21 November 2021 (UTC) @Theleekycauldron: Merriam-Webster considers them definitionally synonymous terms (see definition 2).

Maximilian Dood ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that in August 2021, YouTuber Maximilian Dood's viral social media campaign for Marvel vs. Capcom 2's rerelease caught the regards of studio Digital Eclipse, who expressed interest in rereleasing the game? Source: 1 and 2 Comment: This is the first time I’ve ever made a DYK here, so here goes. I personally find this fact interesting because it highlights how the advent of YouTube, and internet fame in general, has allowed people to use their voice to reach people in positions of high influence, bringing hidden ideas to light and advocating for change. While this specific example falls under a video game/pop-culture category, and may not fit Wikipedia’s desire for academic material, I feel that this is interesting enough to share, as it’s one the gaming community can relate to, like with other social media trends such as #FreeSmash and "Rerelease Mother 3." As for the article itself, all of the citations should be reliable enough; they’re all from third-party/secondary source outlets and there isn’t any BLP violation to be found here. One concern I have is criteria #3 - “Each fact in the hook must be supported in the article by at least one inline citation to a reliable source, appearing no later than the end of the sentence(s) offering that fact. Citations at the end of the paragraph are not sufficient.” While the hook is sourced in the article, the refs are at the end of the section rather than per each sentence. I can fix that however. Anyway, I hope this fact does get accepted! If not, I understand, thanks for reviewing this anyway. Created/expanded by PantheonRadiance (talk). Self-nominated at 08:45, 17 November 2021 (UTC).

Newness requirement satisfied by 5x expansion on 11/15 from < 600 to > 3000 characters. Articles also long enough and compliant with core policies on citations and neutrality. The hook is in-line sourced. Photo has appropriate license. QPQ is done. There are, however, two problems: (1) There is some significant overlap with this source. To start, the following sentence is taken from the source without use of quotation marks and with no effort to paraphrase rather than use the precise words: "Local advocacy led to the establishment of Bridle Trails as a state park in 1932." Further, this sentence also strikes me as too closely drawn from the same source: "Initial park development dates to 1933 when Civil Works Administration employees and federal relief workers were employed in state parks as part of the New Deal program. Further work included burning logging debris, clearing brush and building trails and fences." Work needs to be done to put the material into your own words. (2) The hook strikes me as boring in that it states an obvious point. Horses having the right of way on this trail is not unique or special. On trails that are shared by humans and horses, it is the general rule that horses have the right of way. See here ("In general, horses always have the right of way, followed by hikers, then by bikers."). See also here ("For safety reasons, if you come across a horse and rider on any trail they always have right of way. Hikers and bike riders all yield to horses.")

For one, the quote is not actually "could have been made by aliens" so, considering this is all about misquotation, we should either use the actual quote or clarify that it is a misquotation.

Graham87 09:41, 18 November 2021 (UTC) @Gerda Arendt: Thank you for the review. Diamonds were often cut in cabochon style in the 19th century and earlier. This one was cut with a flat bottom like all cabochons, and when viewed from above, it was a large oval, about 1.5 inches long. Modern cabochons usually have a smoothly rounded surface; this one was lightly faceted but the facets don't show on the sculpture. So it looks like half an egg, I suppose. The Koh-i-Noor is the large oval at the bottom of the picture. We have no specific citation for artistic licence - that is just a conclusion that we can probably make, since we have no evidence that Victoria ever had it set in a necklace. Therefore I cannot use "artistic licence" in a hook or in the article. I'll have a go at a hook using a full-length Victoria, and another hook using the Warrior and Wounded Youth sculpture. I'll come back shortly with those.

Self-nominated at 22:50, 16 November 2021 (UTC). @Ritchie333: Article is a new, plagiarism free, neutral, and well sourced not-stub (1633B). As for the hooks, I'm going to reject ALT0 out of hand, because Ben Comeau can take a number on that one. I'm also going to say no to ALT1, not because it's uncivil or uninteresting, but because it should be quoted—I've suggested two minor alts. A QPQ is also needed. Let me know what you think—nice work! — Preceding unsigned comment added by Theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) 02:57, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Re 1a, I don't see how we know that Comeau personally thinks of Trump; these could have been works-for-hire, after all. I've been trying to come up with something catchy on this -- for example, had Comeau invited Trump to participate in a performance of the work, then we could say he told Trump to fugue himself -- but the sourcing just isn't there that I can see. In consolation, here's an enlightening bit of musical history you will want to share with friends and family: Q: Why did Bach have so many children? Unhide for answer A: Because he didn't have any stops in his organ. In fact, he wore out three organs fuguing. Thanks may be left on my talk page. EEng 16:47, 17 November 2021 (UTC) The video for "Boris Johnson is a Lying Shit" includes a description from Comeau that basically screams for people not to vote for him, and the one for "Donald Trump is a Wanker" says "As satisfying as it is to poke fun at the Orange Monster, this video on its own probably won’t do the teeniest thing to reduce the devastation inflicted by the Trump administration. I therefore want to use this platform to suggest ways we can contribute to meaningful anti-Trump resistance.". We'd need to flesh out the article with these WP:BLPPRIMARY sources for the "thinks" to be properly verifiable.

There is over-linking in the hook. Copyvio seems fine (ignoring the 90% violation, which is a website which copies Wikipedia) QPQ not required.

Or that the Abendmusiken were actually presented right after Vespers?[3] Vespers, which themselves lasted two or three hours, in addition to a further three or four hour Hauptgottesdienst in the morning?[4][5] That might be one of the reasons why the audience was reported to be so disorderly, to the point that the town watch had to be hired to maintain a semblance of order.[6] That, and a lot more, which would surely allow to take this to DYK at a later time, after having greatly expanded this.

Fact is, I have the score and the whole text (including in translation) with me, in addition to lots of critical commentary on the piece itself (too much of which is focused on the question of authenticity, but alas...) and on the Abendmusiken in general. This can be used to make a proper article, but it would require time, which at the moment I really need to put into meeting an actual deadline than here. I've given you a list of pertinent sources (many of which are in German, if that's easier for you), if you're interested you know where to ask. On top of all of that, there's the question of article title (should it be at the current one or at Wacht! Euch zum Streit gefasset macht (a title which is used in a fair amount of sources, too...)

Overall: Article meets eligibility criteria. i.e newness and article length. Article is well sourced and is neutral in tone. Hook is interesting and is cited. Copyvio scores ~20% in major part due to a quote that has been attributed rightly. However, the nominator might want to consider removing the quote and rewriting the sentence because the original Nepal Times article does not have it as a quote and is likely a paraphrasing done by the newspaper to begin with. Hence, we should not include it as a quote. In addition, I would encourage the nominator to consider expanding the article - to be clear, the article is good to go as-is. But looking at Hanuman Dhoka for instance there is an opportunity to build this article more than just a "History" section. Handing it back to the nominator. Some work and this is ready for homepage. Good luck.

Further information: Official supplementary guidelines and unofficial guide  Warning: You are not logged in. Please create an account or log in to proceed. Alternatively, you may leave a message at the bottom of the DYK project talk page with the article you would like to nominate and the hook you would like to propose.  Warning: The helper script only works on desktop. Please switch to desktop view to continue. Install the DYK helper script by adding the line {{subst:lusc|User:SD0001/DYK-helper.js}} to your common.js page. Go back to the article, and choose the "DYK" option from the "More" menu (see image). Fill in the form and submit it. Check back periodically to address comments or concerns from the reviewer (it may take several weeks). Manual instructions[edit] Create a subpage for your new DYK suggestion and then list the page below under the date the article was created or the expansion began or it became a good article (not the date you submit it here), with the newest dates at the bottom. Any registered user may nominate a DYK suggestion (if you are not a registered user, please leave a message at the bottom of the DYK project talk page with the details of the article you would like to nominate and the hook you would like to propose); self-nominations are permitted and encouraged. Thanks for participating and please remember to check back for comments on your nomination (consider watchlisting your nomination page). Read these instructions completely before proceeding. For simplified instructions, see User:Rjanag/Quick DYK 2. I. Create the nomination subpage. Enter the article title in the box below and click the button. (To nominate multiple articles together, enter any or all of the article titles.) You will then be taken to a preloaded nomination page. II. Write the nomination. On the nomination page, fill in the relevant information. See Template:NewDYKnomination and {{NewDYKnomination/guide}} for further information. Not every line of the template needs to be filled in. For instance, if you are not nominating an image to appear with your hook, there is no need to fill in the image-related lines. Add an edit summary e.g. "Nominating YOUR ARTICLE TITLE for DYK" and click Publish page. Make sure the nomination page is on your watchlist, so you can follow the review discussion. III. Post at Template talk:Did you know. In the current nominations section find the subsection for the date on which the article was created or on which expansion began (or, if a new Good Article, the date on which it became a GA), not the date on which you make the nomination. At the top of that subsection (before other nominations already there, but below the section head and hidden comment) add {{Did you know nominations/YOUR ARTICLE TITLE}}. Add an edit summary e.g. "Nominating YOUR ARTICLE TITLE for DYK" and click Publish page. Frequently asked questions[edit] How do I write an interesting hook? Successful hooks tend to have several traits. Most importantly, they share a surprising or intriguing fact. They give readers enough context to understand the hook, but leave enough out to make them want to learn more. They are written for a general audience who has no prior knowledge of or interest in the topic area. Lastly, they are concise, and do not attempt to cover multiple facts or present information about the subject beyond what's needed to understand the hook. When will my nomination be reviewed? This page is often backlogged. As long as your submission is still on the page, it will stay there until an editor reviews it. Since editors are encouraged to review the oldest submissions first, it may take several weeks until your submission is reviewed. In the meantime, please consider reviewing another submission (not your own) to help reduce the backlog (see instructions below). Where is my hook? If you can't find the nomination you submitted to this nominations page, it may have been approved and is on the approved nominations page waiting to be promoted. It could also have been added to one of the prep areas, promoted from prep to a queue, or is on the main page. If the nominated hook is in none of those places, then the nomination has probably been rejected. Such a rejection usually only occurs if it was at least a couple of weeks old and had unresolved issues for which any discussion had gone stale. If you think your nomination was unfairly rejected, you can query this on the DYK discussion page, but as a general rule such nominations will only be restored in exceptional circumstances. Instructions for reviewers[edit] Main page: Wikipedia:Did you know/Reviewing guide Any editor who was not involved in writing/expanding or nominating an article may review it by checking to see that the article meets all the DYK criteria (long enough, new enough, no serious editorial or content issues) and the hook is cited. Editors may also alter the suggested hook to improve it, suggest new hooks, or even lend a hand and make edits to the article to which the hook applies so that the hook is supported and accurate. For a more detailed discussion of the DYK rules and review process see the supplementary guidelines and the WP:Did you know/Reviewing guide. To post a comment or review on a DYK nomination, follow the steps outlined below: Look through this page, Template talk:Did you know, to find a nomination you would like to comment on. Click the "Review or comment" link at the top of the nomination. You will be taken to the nomination subpage. The top of the page includes a list of the DYK criteria. Check the article to ensure it meets all the relevant criteria. To indicate the result of the review (i.e., whether the nomination passes, fails, or needs some minor changes), leave a signed comment on the page. Please begin with one of the 5 review symbols that appear at the top of the edit screen, and then indicate all aspects of the article that you have reviewed; your comment should look something like the following: Article length and age are fine, no copyvio or plagiarism concerns, reliable sources are used. But the hook needs to be shortened. If you are the first person to comment on the nomination, there will be a line :* <!-- REPLACE THIS LINE TO WRITE FIRST COMMENT, KEEPING  :* --> showing you where you should put the comment. Save the page. If there is any problem or concern about a nomination, please consider notifying the nominator by placing {{subst:DYKproblem|Article|header=yes|sig=yes}} on the nominator's talk page. Instructions for project members[edit] How to promote an accepted hook[edit] At-a-glance instructions on how to promote an approved hook to a Prep area See Wikipedia:Did you know/Preparation areas for details on verifying a hook's acceptability. Promoters should not promote their own nomination or their own review When promoting hooks intended for a particular date, keep in mind that when the number of available approved nominations exceeds 120 we switch to two sets per day, and when that number drops below 60 we return to one set per day. Check list for nomination review completeness 1) Select a hook from the approved nominations page that has one of these ticks at the bottom post: . 2) Check to make sure basic review requirements were completed. a. Any outstanding issue following needs to be addressed before promoting. 3) Check the article history for any substantive changes since it was nominated or reviewed. 4) Images for the lead slot must be freely licensed. Fair-use images are not permitted. Images loaded on Commons that appear on the Main Page are automatically protected by KrinkleBot. 5) Hook must be stated in both the article and source (which must be cited at the end of the article sentence where stated). 6) Hook should make sense grammatically. 7) Try to vary subject matters within each prep area. 8) Try to select a funny, quirky or otherwise upbeat hook for the last or bottom hook in the set. Steps to add a hook to prep In one tab, open the nomination page of the hook you want to promote. In a second tab, open the prep set you intend to add the hook to. 1) For hooks held for specific dates, refer to "Local update times" section on DYK Queue. a. Completed Prep area number sets will be promoted by an administrator to corresponding Queue number. 2) Copy and paste the hook into a chosen slot. a. Make sure there's a space between ... and that, and a ? at the end. b. Check that there's a bold link to the article. 3) If it's the lead (first) hook, paste the image where indicated at the top of the template. 4) Copy and paste ALL the credit information (the {{DYKmake}} and {{DYKnom}} templates) at the bottom 5) Check your work in the prep's Preview mode. a. At the bottom under "Credits", to the right of each article should have the link "View nom subpage" ; if not, a subpage parameter will need to be added to the DYKmake. 6) Save the Prep page. Closing the DYK nomination page At the upper left Change {{DYKsubpage to {{subst:DYKsubpage Change |passed= to |passed=yes At the bottom Just above the line containing }}<!--Please do not write below this line or remove this line. Place comments above this line.--> insert a new, separate line containing one of the following: To [[T:DYK/P1|Prep 1]] To [[T:DYK/P2|Prep 2]] To [[T:DYK/P3|Prep 3]] To [[T:DYK/P4|Prep 4]] To [[T:DYK/P5|Prep 5]] To [[T:DYK/P6|Prep 6]] To [[T:DYK/P7|Prep 7]] Also paste the same thing into the edit summary. Check in Preview mode. Make sure everything is against a pale blue background (nothing outside) and there are no stray characters, like }}, at the top or bottom. Save. For more information, please see T:TDYK#How to promote an accepted hook. Handy copy sources: To [[T:DYK/P1|Prep 1]] To [[T:DYK/P2|Prep 2]] To [[T:DYK/P3|Prep 3]] To [[T:DYK/P4|Prep 4]] To [[T:DYK/P5|Prep 5]] To [[T:DYK/P6|Prep 6]] To [[T:DYK/P7|Prep 7]] How to remove a rejected hook[edit] Open the DYK nomination subpage of the hook you would like to remove. (It's best to wait several days after a reviewer has rejected the hook, just in case someone contests or the article undergoes a large change.) In the window where the DYK nomination subpage is open, replace the line {{DYKsubpage with {{subst:DYKsubpage, and replace |passed= with |passed=no. Then save the page. This has the effect of wrapping up the discussion on the DYK nomination subpage in a blue archive box and stating that the nomination was unsuccessful, as well as adding the nomination to a category for archival purposes. How to remove a hook from the prep areas or queue[edit] Edit the prep area or queue where the hook is and remove the hook and the credits associated with it. Go to the hook's nomination subpage (there should have been a link to it in the credits section). View the edit history for that page Go back to the last version before the edit where the hook was promoted, and revert to that version to make the nomination active again. Add a new icon on the nomination subpage to cancel the previous tick and leave a comment after it explaining that the hook was removed from the prep area or queue, and why, so that later reviewers are aware of this issue. Add a transclusion of the template back to this page so that reviewers can see it. It goes under the date that it was first created/expanded/listed as a GA. You may need to add back the day header for that date if it had been removed from this page. If you removed the hook from a queue, it is best to either replace it with another hook from one of the prep areas, or to leave a message at WT:DYK asking someone else to do so. How to move a nomination subpage to a new name[edit] Don't; it should not ever be necessary, and will break some links which will later need to be repaired. Even if you change the title of the article, you don't need to move the nomination page. Nominations[edit] Older nominations[edit] Articles created/expanded on September 2[edit] Articles created/expanded on September 27[edit] Roman campaigns in Germania (12 BC – AD 16) ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that the Romans won a series of campaigns against the Germanic tribes following the disaster at Teutoburg, but decided to leave Germany because its land was not considered valuable? Source: Wells (2003), The Battle That Stopped Rome, pp. 206–7 Improved to Good Article status by SpartaN (talk). Self-nominated at 03:34, 29 September 2021 (UTC). General eligibility: New Enough: Y Long Enough: Y Other problems: Y Policy compliance: Adequate sourcing: Y Neutral: Y Free of copyright violations, plagiarism, and close paraphrasing: Y Other problems: Y Hook eligibility: Cited: N - Source is offline but happy to AGF. However, in the article the statement “they considered German lands too poor for annexation” is sourced to p.204 of Wells. pp.206-7 referred to above is used to support that they that “it was too costly in economic and military resources” to go into in Germany. I guess either way the hook is sourced but could you clarify the exact sourcing of the hook. Interesting: Y QPQ: None required. Overall: Interesting thorough article, well-written with good quality sourcing. Earwig shows no issues. Just a minor query around the hook sourcing but otherwise will be good to go. DeCausa (talk) 08:23, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @DeCausa: I found the web link that (for me) shows a preview if you're able to see it: https://books.google.com/books?id=mc30CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA206&lpg=PA206 SpartaN (talk) 10:07, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @SpartaN: Thanks for providing the link. It’s prompted a couple of thoughts for me. Firstly, Wells doesn’t seem to be saying the reason for the withdrawal is definitively known (“… the reasons for these decisions must have lain…”) i.e he’s making an assumption, however well founded. The hook is more definite than Wells is. Secondly, Wells’ emphasis is on the strength of the resistance being behind the reason - the poor value of the territory makes it “not worth it” because of the strength of the resistance. That’s not quite the same as just saying the land wasn’t valuable. (I notice the text you used in the article on this reflects that effort/value ratio issue.) To fix both points would you be prepared to consider an ALT1 which after “…Teutoburg” continues something along the lines of “…likely decided to leave Germany because the military effort was out of proportion to the territory’s value?” although there may need to be some trimming to get it into the 200 character limit. DeCausa (talk) 11:12, 10 October 2021 (UTC) @SpartaN and DeCausa: It's been over a month since the last comments here, have there been any updates? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:31, 13 November 2021 (UTC) From my point of view I’m waiting for SpartaN’s reply to my last post here. But I notice they haven’t edited Wikipedia since then, over a month ago. So I’m not quite sure what can be done. DeCausa (talk) 08:17, 13 November 2021 (UTC) I see. Given that there's really only one issue holding the nomination back, would anyone be willing to adopt this in case SpartaN doesn't return? It would be a shame if the nomination failed at this point. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 06:35, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I’m not sure what exactly are the DYK rules on this but, subject to that, options could be (a) I propose an ALT1 hook and someone else signs it off; (b) someone else proposes an ALT1 hook and I sign it off; (c) if anyone disagrees with me on the original hook I’m happy to step away and they sign it off. DeCausa (talk) 11:04, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I've looked at the Wells source and concur that it is saying the withdrawal was more down to the ratio of effort required to potential reward, and have boldly tweaked the copy in the article to reflect this. For what it's worth, I think ALT1 works just fine. firefly ( t · c ) 11:16, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Ok. I’m just going to formalize the ALT1 and let someone else add the tick and sign off: ALT1:... that the Romans won a series of campaigns against the Germanic tribes after the disaster at Teutoburg but likely decided to leave Germany as the effort was out of proportion to the territory’s value? DeCausa (talk) 12:07, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Since the reviewer has proposed a new hook, another editor will be needed to sign this off. I'm not sure though if the section linking in the bold links is allowed, however. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:29, 15 November 2021 (UTC) sorry, I missed that. It’s not even necessary to link to a section of the article so I’ve taken it out of ALT1. DeCausa (talk) 08:21, 15 November 2021 (UTC) As this doesn’t seem to be moving I’m going to give ALT1 the tick as original reviewer. If the DYK regulars think this is out of process because I came up nwith ALT1 then happy for it to be reverted. DeCausa (talk) 22:46, 21 November 2021 (UTC) DeCausa, there is no rush to approve, and your approval of your own hook was indeed out of process. I have reverted SL93's promotion of the nomination to prep, and with any luck a new reviewer will be around soon enough to review your ALT1. (SL93, you're welcome to review it, but that means you cannot also promote it.) I've also struck the original hook due to the issues noted above. BlueMoonset (talk) 04:20, 22 November 2021 (UTC) BlueMoonset Sorry for mixing up who approved it. SL93 (talk) 04:26, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I didn't notice the second sentence of the approval...not sure how that happened. Sorry, again. SL93 (talk) 04:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) DeCausa Reading through the article again, your ALT1 hook seems to be mostly verifed in the Aftermath section, but I'm not seeing any indication of it being "likely". SL93 (talk) 21:14, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, that’s true. Where that came from was, in the above discussion with SpartaN on the original hook, they cited Wells in support. Wells says, in relation to Tiberius’ decision to ‘give up’, that “The reason for these decisions must have lain in the Germans’ tough resistance”. I’ve taken that to mean Wells’ was inferring Tiberius’ reasoning without direct evidence (or certainty) of Tiberius’ actual reason. However, you’re right that the way the article is written is more certain. I’m ok striking the “likely” or, possibly it would be better to amend the final sentence of the first paragraph of the Aftermath section to be more reflectve of Wells. DeCausa (talk) 21:48, 22 November 2021 (UTC) I will leave this here for someone else to look at. It would be helpful if the nominator came back. SL93 (talk) 23:21, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Articles created/expanded on October 9[edit] Pankratius Pfeiffer ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that Salvatorian priest Pankratius Pfeiffer saved hundreds of Jews in Rome during the Second World War? Reviewed: 1936 Northeast Flood Created by Ergo Sum (talk). Self-nominated at 17:52, 9 October 2021 (UTC). New article that was created on 9 October 2021? is 3,212 characters and nominated on the same day. No copyvios detected and duplication detector of [1][2][3][4][5] reveal no close paraphrasing issues (AGF PDF docs which can't go through Dup detector). Article is well-sourced. Hook is 103 characters long (under 200 character max.) and is interesting. Refs 4 and 5 (verifying the hook) are reliable sources. QPQ done. Looks good to go! —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:41, 9 October 2021 (UTC) Too many red flags here. If he really saved hundreds of Jews, you would expect plenty of confirmation of this in scholarly sources and him to be recognized by Yad Vashem. I can't count the number of times that I've seen mainstream newspapers print completely false stories about Jews being rescued during the holocaust, so better sources are definitely needed to confirm these extraordinary claims. Thanks Brigade Piron for letting me know about this. (t · c) buidhe 16:51, 10 October 2021 (UTC) I have to admit I'm just a bit perplexed by the argument. Except in fairly uncommon cases of multiple RS that contradict each other, we don't generally recognize any "hierarchy" of reliable sources. Sources are either RS or they are not. So I'm not sure what kind of sources you have in mind as "better" sources. The ones currently cited in the article are all RS, so that should be the end of it. I might add that if you seek some manner of official imprimatur in the vein of Yad Vashem, the City of Rome named a street after him. Your point about why there isn't more extensive coverage of this historical figure is well taken but can easily be attributed to the fact that all manner of historical figures are lost to history, especially those who are notable really for one major event in their life that did not come to light until years later, as is the case here. Indeed, one of the RS in this article describes Pfeiffer as being "lost to history." I'm adding the new review icon here so that we can get at least one more editor's evaluation of this. Ergo Sum 13:32, 16 October 2021 (UTC) There are very few people who actually saved hundreds of Jews during the Holocaust and plenty of hoaxes that were reported as truth by various news organizations—for example Necdet Kent. In other cases, actual rescue did occur but the numbers are greatly exaggerated and repeated uncritically by news organizations, such as Raoul Wallenberg. If the story is true you would expect to see it covered in many more credible sources. There are plenty of cases where a source is reliable for some info but not others. For example, someone's CV is often reliable for "they worked at X organization" but not "they are a world expert in Z". Extraordinary claims require extraordinary sourcing. (t · c) buidhe 21:27, 16 October 2021 (UTC) I should say that I share Buidhe's concerns. I think saying that "all manner of historical figures are lost to history" rather side-steps the sheer volume of historical scholarship on all aspects of the Holocaust. On a more banal note, I think part of the problem is that the sources cited are, essentially, all journalistic sources published by explicitly Catholic or Salvatorian outlets. The specific sources cited for the "saved" claim are Romereports (I am not familiar with this outlet, but the typo in the video does not inspire confidence) and a self-published Salvatorian newsletter. Neither are scholarly sources and both are, again, explicitly confessional in nature. I think WP:BIASED may on point in a highly sensitive issue touching on the wider disputes about Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust. Do we know what the Samerski book says, for example? —Brigade Piron (talk) 08:55, 17 October 2021 (UTC) Buidhe It is true that the sources cover Catholic issues, but only the Salvatorian one is actually published by a Catholic institution. I need not go into how varied Catholic newspapers are in their adherence/faithfulness to the Catholic hierarchy and beliefs (see e.g. National Catholic Reporter versus National Catholic Register). But more direclty, there actually are many scholarly RS that discussion Pfeiffer and his works in Nazi-occupied Rome. You will find them on the other language versions of this article. The problem is that I do not read Italian or German well enough to use them in the article. Coverage is not the issue. It is English language coverage. Ergo Sum 13:48, 17 October 2021 (UTC) @Ergo Sum: perhaps add the word "reportedly" before "saved". I'm inclined to accept in good faith the sources used as reliable – none of them have not been deprecated nor deemed generally unreliable. —Bloom6132 (talk) 16:41, 26 October 2021 (UTC) DYK should not cover unconfirmed reports or rumors so I strongly disagree with that suggestion. As well as assuming sources are reliable if they've never been discussed at WP:RSN, which disregards important parts of WP:RS such as WP:CONTEXTMATTERS. There is no issue with citing sources in Italian or German, but if it's not confirmed that they support the content then it's incorrect to assume that they do. (t · c) buidhe 20:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Bloom6132: I tend to think that statements are either supported by RS and written in wikivoice or they're not accepted at all. For that reason, I shy away from words like "reportedly." I reiterate though that I think it's quite clear there's nothing wrong with the sources currently used. They're all RS, so that should be the end of it. Hence, why I think your initial review was satisfactory. Ergo Sum 23:40, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Ergo Sum: agreed. I'm still of the view that the hook satisfies criteria 3b. Criteria 4 states that "Nominations should be rejected if an inspection reveals that they are not based on reliable sources". That is not the case here. —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) You're still ignoring the principle in RS that context matters, and some sources are reliable for some but not other info. The two of us who actually write on Holocaust related topics have expressed that the sources cited are not reliable for the exceptional claims being made. (t · c) buidhe 23:59, 26 October 2021 (UTC) With all due respect, I am of the opinion that the sources used are reliable for the info in the hook. The fact that you and Brigade Piron write on Holocaust-related topics is irrelevant – it does not confer a veto over hooks pertaining to that subject. By that logic, I should be able to veto baseball or heraldry hooks ... —Bloom6132 (talk) 01:10, 27 October 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: Three of my DYKs promoted (including Coat of arms of the Falkland Islands from August this year) have included the word "reportedly" in the hook, as well as numerous hooks from other editors. Disagree all you want – this is accepted practice at DYK. —Bloom6132 (talk) 23:55, 26 October 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: I'm aware that you have experience writing about Holocaust-related articles and I put value in your assessment as a solid editor. However, I'm quite comfortable in my ability to vet RS, as well, and my confidence in these sources means I must disagree with your opinion here. Experienced editors do disagree at times, and it is my opinion that I think you have gotten this one wrong; doubtless, you think the same for me. I haven't seen any evidence that these are not RS. Therefore, I recommend if Bloom6132 is inclined to do so, to renew their approval of the hook. In the meantime, I'm going to request the input of additional experienced editors on the DYK talk page. Ergo Sum 01:28, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm going to ping @Bamse, Bermicourt, Jmabel, and Anyfile to see if we can find some reliable sources in other languages. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 01:46, 27 October 2021 (UTC) Oops, @AnyFile theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 01:47, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm currently traveling & very busy, so not much help here, I'm afraid. - Jmabel | Talk 01:53, 27 October 2021 (UTC) That said, more or less this same case is made in The Pope's Jews: The Vatican's Secret Plan to Save Jews from the Nazis by Gordon Thomas (not currently cited in the article). - Jmabel | Talk 02:00, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I'm unclear as to why the cited sources are unreliable: are we assuming that all information emanating from a Roman Catholic source is unreliable? If so what's the logic? In any case there are dozens of book sources in English, German, French and Italian that mention Pfeiffer, the problem is that few are accessible online. One is an entire biography of Pfeiffer "from baker to Vatican diplomat" which would be useful to track down: Willer, Philomena (2005). P. Pankratius Pfeiffer SDS: (1872-1945); vom Bäckergesellen zum Vatikandiplomat. Pub: Josef Fink. Others that mentions Pfeiffer and the Jews in Rome are: Liebhart (1996) Schwangau. Meding (1992), Flucht vor Nürnberg. Sinn (1976), Illegal. Bermicourt (talk) 08:41, 27 October 2021 (UTC) My issue is with the unreliability of journalistic works and popular history, which have in many cases published inaccurate information about rescues of Jews during the Holocaust. If better sources exist, they should be cited instead. An additional question is, do these sources actually support the claim of "hundreds" of Jews rescued by Pfeiffer personally? (t · c) buidhe 08:51, 27 October 2021 (UTC) I've now found sources that cover most of the article. Here are more: Liebhart (1996) Schwangau. Meding (1992), Flucht vor Nürnberg. Sinn (1976), Illegal. Prince Constantine of Bavaria (1952) Der Papst. Layer (1985), Schwäbisches Ehrenbuch - Pfeiffer credited with "saving Rome and other Italian cities including Chieti, Ascoli and Ovieto from destruction and other calamities" _ (1999). Publik-Forum - Pfeiffer the only German to have a street named after him in Rome and who fought to save Roman Jews. _ (1960). Bayerische Frömmigkeit - Pfeiffer described as the "Saviour of Rome and other cities in Italy" Robert Katz has written a number of books - Death in Rome (1967), Black Sabbath (1969), The Battle for Rome (2010) - which all mention Pfeiffer. Bottum and Dalin (2004). The Pius War has this interesting piece: "7. Pancrazio [sic] Pfeiffer. According to Carroll-Abbing, one of the men used by Pius XII to protest the Nazi roundup of Rome's Jews and intervene for persecuted victims was Father Pancrazio Pfeiffer, superior general of the Salvatorian Fathers, who also served as Pius XII' personal liaison to the German military command in Rome. Because Pfeiffer died tragically in an automobile accident toward the end of the war and thus never took part in the postwar analysis of Pius XII's conduct, many historians have overlooked him. But those who knew him or have researched his life have chronicled his collaborative efforts with Pius XII to rescue Jews and others during the war. See the article "Pfeiffer's List" by Robert Graham, 30 Days, June 1994, pp. 42-46. Prince Constantine of Bavaria's book on Pius XII, The Pope (London: Allan Wingate, 1954) [listed above] contains an excellent section on Pfeiffer, whom he describes as an agent for the pope on behalf of the victims of persecution and the fugitives in hiding" (p. 213). At Pfeiffer's death in May 1945, Vatican Radio paid tribute: "He came into contact with the Commander of the German occupying forces [in Rome in 1943-44]. From that day onwards, he placed his religious and spiritual qualities at the service of many who had been arrested or already condemned to death. He helped countless people in this way, and saved their lives, among them many Jews and other Italian personages. He championed..." In short there seems to be book evidence for virtually everything stated in the article apart from the specific details of the two incidents where 249 or 400 Jews were rescued. Based on my initial searches my expectation is that those incidents are likely to be recorded in the literature - we just need to be able to access more of the sources. Meanwhile there is no harm in pausing to use some of the above sources, plus those I've added to the Further reading section of the article in order to reinforce the existing references and then review where we are.

For example, Salvatorians USA Province is not independent of the article subject and therefore is not reliable for self-serving assertions such as "he saved many Jews in Rome from persecution and ultimately death" or "Every day, Pfeiffer visited the Regina Coeli prison and another prison on Via Tasso, where he would often return with freed prisoners who had been sentenced to death." (t · c) buidhe 08:27, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @Buidhe: would you still object if the article instead relied on the sources found by Bermicourt? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 04:58, 5 November 2021 (UTC) Depends, the Samerski source looks reliable to me but the book published by "Österreichische Provinz der Salvatorianer" has the same issue of close connection to the article subject. (t · c) buidhe 06:27, 5 November 2021 (UTC) All right. @Ergo Sum: I'm not going to promote the nomination without consensus to move forward, so if you want to try and rework the article's sourcing to approval, that can work.

Ergo Sum 15:45, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I have added several inline citations to the article, which refer to sources that were (very helpfully) added by Bermicourt. These sources support several of the very specific claims in the article, as well as the general thrust of the article which is in dispute here, namely that Pfeiffer was a liaison and in that capacity saved many Jews and others from the Nazis. In light of these reliable sources supporting the general claims, I think any concern about the pre-existing ones describing some of his more specific actions is ameliorated. There is a trove of additional sources in the Further Reading section that additionally describe in much greater detail Pfeiffer's actions but they are either in a foreign language which I do not adequately read to make use of as citations or are offline. All being said, I think there is now ample sourcing to back up the article's claims. Ergo Sum 05:49, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks, Ergo Sum—@Buidhe:, if this sourcing is up to your standards, we can move ahead. If not, we're probably going back to WT:DYK and asking for more eyes. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 05:52, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Hi, I've flagged the specific content in the article that supports the hook as needing a better source. There are other active cleanup tags on the article as well. However, I think there's sufficient sourcing for a modified version of the hook without the words "hundreds of". (t · c) buidhe 06:06, 17 November 2021 (UTC) We could cite "countless" using the ref above instead of "hundreds of". Bermicourt (talk) 08:33, 17 November 2021 (UTC) According to the source it's what Vatican Radio said about him after his death. DYK is not for eulogies imo. (t · c) buidhe 08:37, 17 November 2021 (UTC) I'm not following—is the source unreliable because it's after his death? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 08:40, 17 November 2021 (UTC) No, it's because it's Catholic presumably... We could always add "according to Vatican Radio..." But better still, we just need to cite the exact text from one of the many non-Catholic book sources and the problem will be solved. Bermicourt (talk) 08:46, 17 November 2021 (UTC) And yet another source: O'Reilly (2001) in Forgotten Battles: Italy's War of Liberation 1943-45 states that "the Vatican was able to assist many of Rome's Jews and others sought by the Germans through Father Pancrazio Pfeiffer's intervention with the Germans... His work was recounted by Robert Graham who has written extensively on the Vatican's role in World War II." Bermicourt (talk) 09:01, 17 November 2021 (UTC) And another: Bartley (2016) in Catholics Confronting Hitler states that "Father Pancrace [sic] Pfeiffer, a German priest and the superior general of the Salvatorian Order, was the pope's liaison with the German military. Several hundred hostages, including some under sentence of death, owed their release to the efficacious intervention of Father Pfeiffer." I don't know why I'm doing this - you can look up the references yourselves instead of opining and speculating from the sidelines in the classic Wikipedia way. :) Bermicourt (talk) 09:08, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @Bermicourt: Since it seems you have access to several sources that I do not (probably just requires further digging), would you want to add them as inline citations with page numbers, especially to support the proposition regarding hundreds of people saved?

I'd be in favor instead of the hook being split into two separate proposals: one hook about the fact that she was an internet celebrity who grew up in a place without tap water, and a separate hook about her going viral for making hamburgers. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:23, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Full review needed, which can also address the issue of the borderline ALT1 hook. BlueMoonset (talk) 04:23, 5 November 2021 (UTC) As far as I can tell the article meets DYK requirements, and a QPQ has been done. Earwigs finds a close match with Coda Media, but that's only because it was the source for quotes in the article, and all of them are properly referenced. I find the first hook hard to believe given China's international standing, and in any case as brought up by Bowlhover may be inaccurate anyway. As for the second hook, as I mentioned before it's ineligible as it's exactly 200 characters long, and per WP:DYK hooks that are at or shorter than 200 characters may be rejected per reviewer's discretion. Both ALT0 and ALT1 have struck: I am repeating my earlier suggestion that ALT1 instead be split into two separate hooks. As this is a China-related article and there appear to be some political discussion in the article, I'd also like to ask for a second opinion from someone more knowledgeable about China-related articles if the article doesn't fall afoul of relevant guidelines. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 13:12, 6 November 2021 (UTC) From Wikipedia:Did you know#The hook: The hook should be concise: no more than about 200 characters (including spaces and the question mark, but not including the ..., the space immediately following the ..., or any (pictured)). While 200 is a hard limit, hooks near or at this limit may still be rejected at the discretion of reviewers and administrators. This tool can be used for counting words. The guideline says that "200 is a hard limit", so it is not true that the 200-character ALT1 hook is "ineligible" or "simply too long". No reason has been given for rejecting a 200-character hook "at the discretion of reviewers". Here are two additional hooks based on the suggestion: ALT2: ... that Dianxi Xiaoge, who grew up in a remote Yunnan mountain without running water, is an Internet celebrity with roughly 16 million subscribers on all her platforms? ALT3: ... Dianxi Xiaoge went viral in China and internationally after making hamburgers for her grandparents who had never eaten them before? Cunard (talk) 07:48, 7 November 2021 (UTC) Well for one thing, the original was very difficult to read and seemed to combine too many facts into one hook. Usually DYK prefers simpler hooks whenever possible. In any case, I think ALT3 is the best hook here and the nomination is otherwise good to go, I'd just like to hear a second opinion from another editor on the article tone given that I'm a bit uncomfortable doing a solo review here given the "Commentary" section delves into some political matters. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:36, 7 November 2021 (UTC) On second thought, I have some concerns regarding the length of the article. Isn't it rather detailed for an internet celebrity's page? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 11:10, 7 November 2021 (UTC) That the article is "rather detailed for an internet celebrity's page" should not be a concern. The sources provided substantial analysis of her and her work, and this article reflects those sources. Other detailed articles for Internet celebrities include PewDiePie and MrBeast. Cunard (talk) 11:18, 7 November 2021 (UTC) Pinging Gatoclass for his input, as he responded to a discussion I raised about this nomination over at WT:DYK. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:57, 14 November 2021 (UTC) I don't think we need Gatoclass to restate themself. Here's what they said at WT:DYK: The article doesn't use the phrase "one of only three Chinese influencers to gain international influence", so I'm not sure where you got that, but it does say she is one of only three "Chinese Internet celebrities who have reached international prominence", and the problem with that claim is that it's sourced to an article that is two years old and therefore not up-to-date. With regard to the overall length, I would agree that it is overly detailed and could use a trim. I'm not sure this is relevant to DYK however, as "overly detailed" is not one of our criteria. What I would say is that the level of detail does raise the chances of close paraphrasing so the article would need to be carefully checked for that. Anybody else with an opinion on this article?

Thriley (talk) 20:57, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @Thriley: I'll ping BlueMoonset here in case I'm wrong, but I'm going to say no, it isn't. My reasoning here is that if the hook were read as plaintext, without any bolding or linking, it would be read as pretty much only interesting as it concerns the plot. The hook should concern Smit's life; if it concerns her work as an actress, only stating her role and not anything about production doesn't make the hook out-of-universe. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 21:28, 17 November 2021 (UTC) theleekycauldron, I was taking a look at the ALT1 hook and its sources, and the second Biography sentence is basically copied from Esquire—the Google translate version, at any rate. That's a problem. Another problem is that the source doesn't actually say that she was working as a hotel receptionist when she got the call, just that it was "one of these jobs", referring back to the four in the previous sentence, none of which were hotel receptionist. The article also needs a bit of copyediting. I don't think that either of the plot-based hooks should be used, and as Drmies notes, "first film" is not accurate, since it's Cross the Line that's in the source, which appears to be her fifth film. We could only use "first feature film" if the previous four in her filmography were all short films (which would need to be clearly sourced). Perhaps an angle for the information in ALT1 would be to say she was working in whatever job it was when she was cast in Cross the Line, for which she was nominated as best new actress in the Goya Awards. BlueMoonset (talk) 02:31, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Here’s an article that states she was working as a receptionist two years before she was hired to work on Parallel Mothers:[6] Does it appear reliable? Thriley (talk) 05:38, 20 November 2021 (UTC) I don't see a reason to doubt the source. However, it isn't sufficient to support the "when she was called" hook claim, just that she was a hotel receptionist two years before the article was written (and possibly two years and a number of months, since you can't assume it's exactly two years). BlueMoonset (talk) 17:14, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Perhaps the hook should include all her various jobs before her Almodovar role? Thriley (talk) 01:47, 23 November 2021 (UTC) ALT3 “before starring in the Pedro Almodóvar film Parallel Mothers, Milena Smit worked as a model, waitress, shop assistant, babysitter, teleoperator, subway information assistant, and hotel receptionist?” El País Thriley (talk) 01:51, 23 November 2021 (UTC) That hook is 197 characters which puts it in discretionary territory. Given though that the hookiness here is that she did all of these non-acting jobs, I think in this case the length is justified since it hasn't reached the limit.

I do like the hooks and it's an intriguing subject for an article! I wanted to flag the following comments, in case they are helpful (please ignore if not!): I don't quite follow this sentence in the lead: "Moreover, it is still pointed out that the emendation Albruna agrees with the names of other Germanic wise women." Should "instriptions" (before the Drusus heading) be "inscriptions"? Should the names of scholars be wikilinked, where there is a page for the author (e.g. Simek)? What does mss mean, and could this be explained when it is first referenced? The second paragraph of the Aurinia section has two sentences starting with "However" in a row, which is a bit awkward to read.

To be expected, since they're cited almost 20 times each, and since the vast majority of the matches concern long quotes I'm willing to overlook it, but can we add more citations throughout the paragraphs? Particularly with "Conflict with Miles and Reynolds", there's four citations crammed at the end of the section. I think we should cite each after the corresponding sentences, especially where there's a direct quotation. Also for ALT0 we need a citation at the ends of the sentences for "Golden Boy" and "Whiz Kid". Otherwise nice read, and good use of sources.

Its long enough and new and lots of good refs - including the hook fact. It documents a notable woman from the 14th century and there were not many of those.

Nice addition. well done Victuallers (talk) 10:31, 6 November 2021 (UTC) Reopening this because I think the hook is misleading, as according to the source it was usual for women of the nobility, like Neville, to sign with their own names. Gatoclass (talk) 02:10, 19 November 2021 (UTC) @Gatoclass: I don't think most will know that, so maybe we go with ALT1 or some variation on it? We don't need to say it's unusual if we phrase it that way theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 02:14, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Theleekycauldron, the problem with both hooks is that they imply that there was something out-of-the-ordinary in a woman signing something in her own name in that era, whereas the source indicates that was normal practice for women of the nobility. So the hooks are misleading. Gatoclass (talk) 02:19, 19 November 2021 (UTC) All right—I'll ping @Lajmmoore and Victuallers: back here, y'all can work this out. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 02:33, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Was it usual for women in the fourteenth century to sign with their own name ... no. Is is usual for women in the 21st century to sign with just their first name? No. So "did you know that unusually Canada's head of state signs documents with just her first name and an R for Regina?" (Someone shouts) "BUT all British Queens do that!!" (Someone shouts) "That implies that it was unusual for Queens to sign with just their first name." No it doesnt. I think @Gatoclass: is reading the source and then saying that the hook doesnt explain every piece of information in the source... which obviously it doesnt. Its unusual that "a woman" is doing this at all. It WAS unusual for women in the fourteenth century to sign and if they did then they did not usually use just their own name. Its a fact - its unusual. Did You know that women did not sign their own names on documents in the 14th century? No I didnt. That is something that Lajmmoore wrote about and now I know. Thanks. Victuallers (talk) 08:28, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Hello Gatoclass all so the part of the source I was using is this, which is talking about signatures for charitable donation "Although most of the widows declare themselves to be the wife of their late husband, or their father's daughter, others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names, such as 'domina Margareta de Longvl' and 'don-ýina Margareta de Nevill' (the same person). The majority of widows declare that their marital status and their power to act, using a variety of phrases, including 'in pura viduitate', 'in pura viduitate mea et ligia potestate', and 'in viduitate mea propria et potestate legitima' ..." and I read that as it was more usual for (noble) women to use a signature that described them as "wife of, etc..." I read the passage as Legg using Margaret de Neville as an unusual example. Legg is talking about the Coucher Book signatures specifically, but I still think they are marking out unusual practice. In terms of the hook, I wonder whether changing 'woman' to 'literate woman' might work? Lajmmoore (talk) 09:32, 19 November 2021 (UTC) No, it wouldn't work just to add "literate". And your reading of the text just amounts to an unsupported assumption on your part. Because while the text could admittedly be less ambiguous, the statement that others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names does not in any way suggest that it was rare or unusual for a member of the nobility to give their name, it only states that members of the nobility as a class were inclined to give their names. So there isn't sufficient support in that statement for a hook which implies that Neville's act was in any way unusual for a member of her class. The hook makes Neville sound like some sort of proto-feminist who boldly challenged the system, when the underlying source only indicates that either her entire class did the same thing, or at least that it was an accepted practice for members of the nobility. So I still think that either the hook needs to be substantially reworked to more closely reflect the source, or a new hook be found. Gatoclass (talk) 02:53, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks for sharing your interpretation of your text Gatoclass. My interpretation (& so the hook) is based on Legg's use of the word most - in that "most of the widows declare themselves to be the wife of their late husband, or their father's daughter" and you rightly point out "others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names" but I think that needs to be balanced by the "most" earlier in the sentence i.e. for women generally, they don't give their name, but some noble women do but overall, for women signing their name, it is unusual enough to be pointed out in the text.

Whispyhistory (talk) 04:04, 13 November 2021 (UTC) @Whispyhistory: But that would be impossible, the article can't possibly mention IP addresses, it's about broken toes.

It's okay with me if allowed (dyk says hook needs to be in article and in the following ref). Whispyhistory (talk) 06:32, 13 November 2021 (UTC) I don't see that exact sequence of numbers in the source, although there are others that look a bit like an IP address. The trouble is, the nominator seems to be the source for it looking a bit like an IP address, which it does, but we can't use that unless the source makes a similar point, which it does not appear to do. Something like this might work (numbers might need to be changed as mentioned): ALT1 ... that a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone may be described as 88.5.3.2? Philafrenzy (talk) 10:16, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Regarding the image, it's a fun idea but I don't think we run images as quizzes and the image is simply a skeletal foot, and not closely enough related to the hook.

I don't see how the hook you're suggesting is hooky. What exactly is wrong with the hook proposed? It's in the article and it's supported by the sources cited. And the image is directly related to the hook. It engages the reader into a spotting game. Dr. Vogel (talk) 14:57, 13 November 2021 (UTC) Like everyone else, I rather like the IP-address hook. If we wikilinked IP address, it would be supported in the linked articles, and fulfill the requirement that anyone following the links will be able to verify the hook. I don't think we need sourcing that says that a specific sequence of numbers is an IP address, as we have sources giving the general format of an IP address, and creating an example would be a trivial calculation ("Are all four of these numbers separated by periods in the range 0-255?"): "IPv4 and IPv6 address formats". www.ibm.com. An IPv4 address has the following format: x . x . x . x where x is called an octet and must be a decimal value between 0 and 255. Octets are separated by periods. An IPv4 address must contain three periods and four octets. The following examples are valid IPv4 addresses: 1 . 2 . 3 . 4 01 . 102 . 103 . 104 This hook is better than any alternative I can think of, and I don't see anything likely to be problematic about it (it's certainly verifiable). I think we might be in agreement on that? So if some rule technically prohibits it, we might have a good case for applying the WP:Ignore all the rules policy. Broken finger is also currently DYK-eligible and I think it uses the same numbering scheme.[1] HLHJ (talk) 02:07, 14 November 2021 (UTC) [edit: add fulltext url] I don't necessarily agree with the reading of WP:DYKCRIT 3b ( Each fact in the hook must be supported in the article by at least one inline citation to a reliable source [...]) that says that the IP thing needs to be in the article (compare e.g. Template:Did you know nominations/Urine deflector, which similarly took some creative licence in how the proposed hooks were phrased beyond what was stated in either the article or the cited source), and I agree with HLHJ that WP:IAR would be applicable regardless. As for the hooks themselves, writing "a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone may be described as 88.5.3.2" is a much poorer way of writing the hook (less "hooky") than the converse, i.e. "88.5.3.2 may refer to a fracture in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone". TompaDompa (talk) 11:28, 14 November 2021 (UTC) This. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 17:01, 16 November 2021 (UTC) We can't use IP address because the nominator just thought it up "oh, that looks like an IP address". It's not in the source as the nominator admits and therefore is not verifiable. And so what if it does look like an IP address? What does that tell us about broken toes? I like clever or quirky hooks and have written many (if I may say so), but they have to be based on something in the sources otherwise it's things made up one day. Philafrenzy (talk) 10:19, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you for all your comments. This is not the place to ignore all rules. The proposed hook is not supported by the source given in the article. I am inclined to approve ALT1 but it needs checking, unless another hook is proposed. Whispyhistory (talk) 15:11, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Oh dear, this has become contentious. I think the contended question is whether it's acceptable to have verified information not found in the nominated article, but only in another article, linked in the hook. Not as hooky, but for illustration: ALT3 ... that the dot-decimal notation string "88.5.3.2" is not only an an IPv4 address, but also a fracture in the middle of the bone at the tip of the little toe? "IPv4 and IPv6 address formats". www.ibm.com., Hallux proximal phalanx fracture in adults: an overlooked diagnosis I don't think we're debating whether the IP-address-hook statement is verifiable. The statement that "88.5.3.2" (and any number in that format) is a valid IPv4 address is supported by the IP address article and the IPv4 article, and this format is the subject of the Dot-decimal notation article. No-one had bothered to cite those statements in those articles, but since they've been challenged here, I've now cited them. So "88.5.3.2 is both an IP address[1] and a code for a broken toebone[2]" is certainly verifiable, and is now verified on Wikipedia. Any DYK reader should have no trouble verifying that the hook is accurate. Alternatives that do not mention IP addressees are not as hooky, but don't contain more information about broken toes: ALT4 ... that "88.5.3.2" is a toe fracture in the middle of the bone at the tip of the little toe, while a "78.5.3.2" is the parallel broken finger?

Philafrenzy (talk) 19:25, 14 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you Philafrenzy ( a very experienced DYK contributor) for your efforts in helping new editors understand DYK. Your comment higher up about "88.5.3.2" and "ip address" not being in the source is true and I am grateful for your suggested alts. Essentially, the initial and subsequent hooks sound good, but none are in the article or the source. I don't wish for personal comments and don't mind if someone else wishes to take over here. With due respect @DrVogel: and @HLHJ:...You may wish to take this up at Wikipedia talk:Did you know. Whispyhistory (talk) 10:41, 15 November 2021 (UTC) I won't say I wish I hadn't written the article; I hope it's useful enough to make up for the social harm to the project here. I don't think the hostility was intended by anyone; I suspect that it's felt partly due to the ease of mininterpretation in a text-only medium and partly due to human cognitive biases.[2] I certainly did, and do, not intend it. I spent a day's editing trying to resolve the conflict by finding references specifically saying that the two things were in notation X and adding that text to the article, but unfortunately non-inductive descriptions of the notations seem to have been considered so needless that an Internet RFC attempting to formalize them died of disinterest. I did find a source that explicitly defines the IPv4 format, and one that explicitly says that 88.1.2.2 is a specific fracture, and I've cited the latter in the article, but I don't think this helps. It is probably a bit unreasonable to expect a reviewer to do more than apply rules as best they can, and Wikipedia talk:Did you know might indeed be a better forum for a more detailed discussion. I don't really want to take part in one, though (nothing to do with this discussion, prior reasons). I posted because I felt responsible for the conflict and thought I might be able to help. My impression is that I made it worse; my apologies to everyone I've offended. HLHJ (talk) 03:41, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Nobody is offended, but if I may say so I think you are still missing the point. IP addresses have nothing to do with broken toes even if that notation may have a similarity. That's why the sources don't make the comparison and why the IP-based hooks are no good. Any of the other hooks might be fine (I haven't checked the numbers) just without the bit about IP addresses. The whole thing reminds me of unusually shaped vegetables where you may see a carrot shaped like a foot, people who see faces in clouds, and even apophenia. My personal observation that one thing looks a bit like another is not the basis for a hook unless reliable sources make the point too. Philafrenzy (talk) 09:09, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Folks, we are wasting a wonderful hook. Really. IP addresses have nothing to do with broken toes even if that notation may have a similarity and that is the whole point of making good hooks. They are supposed to be short, punchy, catchy, and likely to draw the readers in to wanting to read the article – as long as they don't misstate the article content. And one of the best recipes to make a hook good is to make it sound counterintuitive With any other option but the original, we are bound to receive another hook frequented by maybe a few hundred visitors. I would propose something to the tune of in some contexts, 88.5.3.2 might not mean an IP address but a broken bone in the middle of the little toe's outermost bone? so that no one claims here that we somehow delegitimise the IP address but at the same time so that we preserve the core of the hook. As for the claims that because the hook is not cited in the IP part, it can't be there - please don't be that pedantic. In our today's world of informatics we may assume that people who visit Wikipedia more or less imagine what IP addresses are, and may more or less imagine how they look like (in the worst case they will visit the article for details). The other part is cited. I see no problem with the original. Szmenderowiecki (talk) 17:01, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Szmenderowiecki I admit that I'm not very familiar with the topic, and the above discussion was confusing, but is the "this isn't an IP address" claim actually in the source? Because if it's not, then no matter how good the hook proposal is, it can't be used in a hook since hook facts need to be based on a reference. Also, I'm pretty sure that assumptions don't count as sources. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:31, 17 November 2021 (UTC) What I was leading is that we don't need to cite that the sky is blue, or that we have five fingers; or that there exist IP addresses for that matter.

We're allowed to. This is not a massive occasion where we can save the whole project by breaking the rules. Its a trivial example of what some (not all) think may be a breach in the rules, with a small, but amusing, advantage. So I'm not asking the defenders of the rules to admit that this is not a breech ... I am suggesting that they might just concede that the harm done by allowing this hook might not offend anyone ... and it might please a few thousand. Victuallers (talk) 15:28, 20 November 2021 (UTC) We don't need to break the rules. The observation that the notation looks a bit like an IP address is trivial and completely unrelated to broken toes. There are already perfectly good hooks above that work better. Nobody is saying don't use the numbers, just strike the bit about IP addresses. The originally proposed hook is not the work of comic genius and cleverness that some seem to think it is. Philafrenzy (talk) 21:58, 20 November 2021 (UTC) The main issue here is that it's one of the core rules of DYK that hook facts must be mentioned in the article, ideally explicitly or at least implied by supporting information. The thing is that at the moment, IP addresses are not mentioned anywhere in the article, so the hooks using the IP address angle would be ineligible according to that criterion anyway. Even April Fools hooks, which tend to be misleading, are still generally based on hook facts that are mentioned in the respective articles. So if we can't even grant IAR exemptions for that criterion for AFD hooks, the one day of the year where our hooks tend to follow the rules most loosely, I can't see why such a request should be granted here.

Nominated by Victuallers (talk) at 16:21, 6 November 2021 (UTC). Article is new enough. Two correct writers are credited. The article is fully referenced. No copyvio detected. There is a bit of biased POV pushing in Wikipedia voice: "most vulnerable to climate change". This will be something our subject is saying no doubt. And this idea is also reflected in the hook with "endangered". The hook content is referenced and confirmed by the Guardian, apart from the "endangered" bit, which opinion is attributed to Tina Stege. So I suggest that "endangered" is taken out of the hook, or it is reworded so it is clear she is saying that. Hook alt1 is unsuitable as it does not link the article and I cannot tell what it is trying to say in relation to the subject. I can confirm image is CC-BY-3.0 as derived from the video with CC-BY-3.0 license. However I would suggest that a different image is selected from the video, perhaps near the end where the microphone is not obscuring her chin. QPQ is done. Graeme Bartlett (talk) 06:03, 15 November 2021 (UTC) @Graeme Bartlett: Thanks for the review Graeme - I have recut a new image. Surprised that "endangered" wasn't referenced. I'm not sure it is just her opinion -"Projected sea level rise would mean 40% of the buildings in the Marshall Islands’ capital of Majuro would be permanently flooded and entire islands would disappear, potentially costing the Pacific country its status as a nation, according to a devastating new report from the World Bank." is a quote from the reference I have added to balance the idea that "endangered" might by pov.

Graeme Bartlett (talk) 20:56, 22 November 2021 (UTC) @Graeme Bartlett: Are you suggesting that we imply that "endangered" is her opinion despite the fact that she represents a nation and the "endangered" aspect is supported by the World Bank and the Guardian newspaper (and the 1bn people estimated to be part of the "High Ambition" group ) saying so? Is there any evidence that is just her opinion and not that of her country and the World Bank? Am I missing something? It you feel you need to give this "a cross" then can I suggest that we ask for a new reviewer?I have suggested an alt that does not use the endangered word.

Self-nominated at 23:51, 4 November 2021 (UTC). @DferDaisy: This article is about 3300 bytes, and was nominated for DYK shortly after creation, satisfying date and length criteria. There is a factual error, as the article states she was interred in Keokuk, Illinois, but the source says she died in Chicago, Illinois and was interred in Keokuk, Iowa. I am assuming good faith for a few references I cannot access (for example, ref 15 - The National Humane Review), which for me gives a landing page for the document, instead of an inside view). Otherwise, everything is properly sourced and there are no copyvio or close paraphrasing concerns (Earwig cites 3 potential problems, but they are not an issue here.) QPQ not required. Regarding the hooks, ALT0 is incorrect as stated, as it reads as if the study was conducted in the early 1900s by Meigs Crowder, whereas she published it in 1917 based on studies from that period. It'll need minor alteration. ALT1 is fine and sourced. I would prefer to promote an amended ALT0. A minor quibble, though not an issue for DYK: please add page numbers for cited sources. If online access is eliminated from the sources, it'll force anyone investigating those sources to wade through too many pages to find the desired detail.

AleatoryPonderings (???) (!!!) 01:52, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @AleatoryPonderings: Yes, but note that this court case is the "leading case with respect to the issue of common employers", establishing a precedent in Canadian law. At the time the lawsuit was filed, this was not the case, and in fact the trial judge ruled against Alouche (see last paragraph of background section); it was only after the case was brought to the Court of Appeal for Ontario that the "common employer doctrine" was established, and it became entrenched when leave to appeal the decision at the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed. Mindmatrix 15:11, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Ah, so the idea behind the hook is that, since Downtown Eatery changed the law on common employers, before Downtown Eatery Best Beaver would not have been Alouche's employer? That makes more sense. AleatoryPonderings (???) (!!!) 15:20, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Comment: I'm going to inspect this again... Mindmatrix 15:18, 4 November 2021 (UTC) @AleatoryPonderings: Alright, so to ensure everything is correct, the following timeline occurred: Alouche was hired to be manager at For Your Eyes Only (owned by Grad and Grosman), and began work on 29 December 1992 Alouche was sent a Notice of Discipline in May 1993, and was fired on 15 June 1993 In October 1993, Alouche filed action for wrongful dismissal against Best Beaver Management Inc., as that was the source of his paycheques Best Beaver ceased operations in mid-1996, and all assets distributed to other companies owned by Grad and Grosman The trial resolved in favour of Alouche Best Beaver did not pay out the judgement (all its assets had been redistributed) Sherriffs were dispatched to For Your Eyes Only, where they seized $1,855 Downtown Eatery filed claim against Alouche, stating the cash belonged to it Alouche defended, and counterclaimed against Grad, Grosman, and all companies they controlled on the grounds of common employer doctrine, the oppression remedy of the Ontario Business Corporations Act, and fraudulent conveyance the judge in the second trial (at Ontario Superior Court of Justice) ruled against Alouche the case was brought to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, where the previous ruling was overturned in 2001 in January 2002, an application for leave to appeal the decision at the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed So, the common employer doctrine was part of the second trial as a counterclaim to the suit filed by Downtown Eatery. I just wanted to ensure this satisfies your concerns. Mindmatrix 18:25, 4 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks for this incredibly thorough response. My concern is maybe philosophical or definitional. If I say that company A employs person B, that has an ordinary meaning and a legal meaning. It is probably right that Best Beaver did not employ Alouche in the ordinary sense of "employ", because Best Beaver was a "paymaster" and not the name on the front of the building where he went to work. My reading of the case itself is that, before Downtown Eatery, it was at best indeterminate as a legal matter whether Best Beaver, alone or in combination with its affiliate companies, employed Alouche. After Downtown Eatery, it was established—as a matter of legal meaning, but not necessarily ordinary meaning—that Best Beaver was his employer, or part of his employer, or something like that. The reason I brought this up is that it's not clear how one could verify the claim that "Best Beaver was not Alouche's employer", because that claim might be true as a matter of ordinary meaning but the only authoritative legal ruling we have on this (namely, Downtown Eatery) holds that the claim is false. In any event, I'll leave this to the eventual reviewer to sort out. I find my brain twisting into knots. AleatoryPonderings (???)

However, it includes a WP:IMDB source and I am unsure about the reliability of several other sources, including Film Ink, Queer Media Matters, Antaeus.org, Fern TV, Addicted to Horror Movies, Dan's Papers, Go Mag, Three Women in a Box and North Coast Rep. To add to that, the YouTube link does not appear to be uploaded by an official channel, making it unreliable. Additionally, per MOS:FILMCAST uncredited roles need a source. the copyvio checker showed up a 50%+ similarity with a source, which may suggest over quotation. On top of that, the subject has unclear notability. I'm unsure which roles are significant and The House on Pine Street appears to have a questionable notability. None of her awards seem significant and I'm not seeing any significant coverage from reliable, independent sources. ALT0 isn't very interesting given the festival is not significant enough to have an article. I think ALT1 is interesting but it seems to focus more on the character, not the actress which isn't exactly ideal... QPQ not needed. We'll need some work but we'll get there!

Thanks, DanCherek. while the article is over 1,500 prose characters, I'm going to be a stickler and say that this is still a stub.

Moving on, the article was created from a redir and nominated in time and is neutral, although I'm requesting a second opinion on the sourcing. The article seems to be plagiarism free, and a QPQ has been done. As for the hook, I'm not sure it quite checks out—is the church expected to break away?

Once we clear those two up, we're good to go. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 02:41, 21 November 2021 (UTC) @Theleekycauldron: Not entirely sure what the concern on the sourcing is; there are multiple reputable sources.

Thanks! ~ Pbritti (talk) 05:10, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Isn't there a difference between "planned" (alt1) and "expected" (alt0)? planned implies it may or may not happen, expected is like forecasting—at least, that's how i read it. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 05:19, 21 November 2021 (UTC) @Theleekycauldron: Merriam-Webster considers them definitionally synonymous terms (see definition 2).

Maximilian Dood ( Review or comment Article history ) ... that in August 2021, YouTuber Maximilian Dood's viral social media campaign for Marvel vs. Capcom 2's rerelease caught the regards of studio Digital Eclipse, who expressed interest in rereleasing the game? Source: 1 and 2 Comment: This is the first time I’ve ever made a DYK here, so here goes. I personally find this fact interesting because it highlights how the advent of YouTube, and internet fame in general, has allowed people to use their voice to reach people in positions of high influence, bringing hidden ideas to light and advocating for change. While this specific example falls under a video game/pop-culture category, and may not fit Wikipedia’s desire for academic material, I feel that this is interesting enough to share, as it’s one the gaming community can relate to, like with other social media trends such as #FreeSmash and "Rerelease Mother 3." As for the article itself, all of the citations should be reliable enough; they’re all from third-party/secondary source outlets and there isn’t any BLP violation to be found here. One concern I have is criteria #3 - “Each fact in the hook must be supported in the article by at least one inline citation to a reliable source, appearing no later than the end of the sentence(s) offering that fact. Citations at the end of the paragraph are not sufficient.” While the hook is sourced in the article, the refs are at the end of the section rather than per each sentence. I can fix that however. Anyway, I hope this fact does get accepted! If not, I understand, thanks for reviewing this anyway. Created/expanded by PantheonRadiance (talk). Self-nominated at 08:45, 17 November 2021 (UTC).

Newness requirement satisfied by 5x expansion on 11/15 from < 600 to > 3000 characters. Articles also long enough and compliant with core policies on citations and neutrality. The hook is in-line sourced. Photo has appropriate license. QPQ is done. There are, however, two problems: (1) There is some significant overlap with this source. To start, the following sentence is taken from the source without use of quotation marks and with no effort to paraphrase rather than use the precise words: "Local advocacy led to the establishment of Bridle Trails as a state park in 1932." Further, this sentence also strikes me as too closely drawn from the same source: "Initial park development dates to 1933 when Civil Works Administration employees and federal relief workers were employed in state parks as part of the New Deal program. Further work included burning logging debris, clearing brush and building trails and fences." Work needs to be done to put the material into your own words. (2) The hook strikes me as boring in that it states an obvious point. Horses having the right of way on this trail is not unique or special. On trails that are shared by humans and horses, it is the general rule that horses have the right of way. See here ("In general, horses always have the right of way, followed by hikers, then by bikers."). See also here ("For safety reasons, if you come across a horse and rider on any trail they always have right of way. Hikers and bike riders all yield to horses.")

For one, the quote is not actually "could have been made by aliens" so, considering this is all about misquotation, we should either use the actual quote or clarify that it is a misquotation.

Graham87 09:41, 18 November 2021 (UTC) @Gerda Arendt: Thank you for the review. Diamonds were often cut in cabochon style in the 19th century and earlier. This one was cut with a flat bottom like all cabochons, and when viewed from above, it was a large oval, about 1.5 inches long. Modern cabochons usually have a smoothly rounded surface; this one was lightly faceted but the facets don't show on the sculpture. So it looks like half an egg, I suppose. The Koh-i-Noor is the large oval at the bottom of the picture. We have no specific citation for artistic licence - that is just a conclusion that we can probably make, since we have no evidence that Victoria ever had it set in a necklace. Therefore I cannot use "artistic licence" in a hook or in the article. I'll have a go at a hook using a full-length Victoria, and another hook using the Warrior and Wounded Youth sculpture. I'll come back shortly with those.

Self-nominated at 22:50, 16 November 2021 (UTC). @Ritchie333: Article is a new, plagiarism free, neutral, and well sourced not-stub (1633B). As for the hooks, I'm going to reject ALT0 out of hand, because Ben Comeau can take a number on that one. I'm also going to say no to ALT1, not because it's uncivil or uninteresting, but because it should be quoted—I've suggested two minor alts. A QPQ is also needed. Let me know what you think—nice work! — Preceding unsigned comment added by Theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) 02:57, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Re 1a, I don't see how we know that Comeau personally thinks of Trump; these could have been works-for-hire, after all. I've been trying to come up with something catchy on this -- for example, had Comeau invited Trump to participate in a performance of the work, then we could say he told Trump to fugue himself -- but the sourcing just isn't there that I can see. In consolation, here's an enlightening bit of musical history you will want to share with friends and family: Q: Why did Bach have so many children? Unhide for answer A: Because he didn't have any stops in his organ. In fact, he wore out three organs fuguing. Thanks may be left on my talk page. EEng 16:47, 17 November 2021 (UTC) The video for "Boris Johnson is a Lying Shit" includes a description from Comeau that basically screams for people not to vote for him, and the one for "Donald Trump is a Wanker" says "As satisfying as it is to poke fun at the Orange Monster, this video on its own probably won’t do the teeniest thing to reduce the devastation inflicted by the Trump administration. I therefore want to use this platform to suggest ways we can contribute to meaningful anti-Trump resistance.". We'd need to flesh out the article with these WP:BLPPRIMARY sources for the "thinks" to be properly verifiable.

There is over-linking in the hook. Copyvio seems fine (ignoring the 90% violation, which is a website which copies Wikipedia) QPQ not required.

Or that the Abendmusiken were actually presented right after Vespers?[3] Vespers, which themselves lasted two or three hours, in addition to a further three or four hour Hauptgottesdienst in the morning?[4][5] That might be one of the reasons why the audience was reported to be so disorderly, to the point that the town watch had to be hired to maintain a semblance of order.[6] That, and a lot more, which would surely allow to take this to DYK at a later time, after having greatly expanded this.

Fact is, I have the score and the whole text (including in translation) with me, in addition to lots of critical commentary on the piece itself (too much of which is focused on the question of authenticity, but alas...) and on the Abendmusiken in general. This can be used to make a proper article, but it would require time, which at the moment I really need to put into meeting an actual deadline than here. I've given you a list of pertinent sources (many of which are in German, if that's easier for you), if you're interested you know where to ask. On top of all of that, there's the question of article title (should it be at the current one or at Wacht! Euch zum Streit gefasset macht (a title which is used in a fair amount of sources, too...)

Overall: Article meets eligibility criteria. i.e newness and article length. Article is well sourced and is neutral in tone. Hook is interesting and is cited. Copyvio scores ~20% in major part due to a quote that has been attributed rightly. However, the nominator might want to consider removing the quote and rewriting the sentence because the original Nepal Times article does not have it as a quote and is likely a paraphrasing done by the newspaper to begin with. Hence, we should not include it as a quote. In addition, I would encourage the nominator to consider expanding the article - to be clear, the article is good to go as-is. But looking at Hanuman Dhoka for instance there is an opportunity to build this article more than just a "History" section. Handing it back to the nominator. Some work and this is ready for homepage. Good luck.

There's also a missing citation in the "Career" section. I've done some MOS and copy-editing, but left these for the nominator to resolve, presumably with sources that exist and have already been used in the article.
