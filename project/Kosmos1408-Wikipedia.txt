It was launched into low Earth orbit on 16 September 1982, replacing Kosmos 1378. On 15 November 2021, it was destroyed in a Russian anti-satellite weapons test, resulting in space debris in orbits between 300 and 1,100 km (190 and 680 miles) above the Earth. The threat of potential collision with debris forced the crew of the International Space Station to take shelter in their escape capsules. Contents 1 Purpose and launch 2 Destruction 3 See also 4 References Purpose and launch[edit] The satellite was part of the Tselina-D system of ELINT military surveillance satellites.[2][3] It was developed by Yuzhnoye, and had a mass of around 2,200 kg (4,900 lb),[4] with an expected lifespan of around six months.[5] It replaced Kosmos 1378 in the Tselina system.[4] Kosmos 1408 was launched on a Tsyklon-3 launch vehicle on 16 September 1982,[5] from Site 32/2[6] at the Plesetsk Cosmodrome.[4] It was placed in low Earth orbit, with a perigee of 645 km (401 mi), an apogee of 679 km (422 mi), and an inclination of 82.5°. Its orbital period was 97.8 minutes.[1] Destruction[edit] On 15 November 2021, the satellite was destroyed, generating a space debris cloud that threatened the International Space Station (ISS).[2] The seven crew members aboard the ISS (four American, two Russian, one German)[7] took shelter in the crew capsules[8] so they could quickly return to Earth if debris struck the station.[9] The satellite had been in an orbit at an altitude just above the ISS orbital altitude,[3] and the debris passes by the ISS every 93 minutes.[10] The crew only sheltered for the second and third passes through the debris field, due to an assessment of the debris risk.[11] The debris also poses a risk to other low Earth orbit satellites.[9] The United States Department of State subsequently accused Russia of having targeted Kosmos 1408 during an anti-satellite weapon test, using a ground-based missile against their own defunct satellite,[10] saying that it was "dangerous and irresponsible".[7] The following day, Sergei Shoigu, the Russian minister of defence, acknowledged that the debris was due to a Russian missile test, but argued that it posed no threat to any space activities.[12] The A-235 missile ("Nudol")[6] was launched from Plesetsk Cosmodrome.[9] The system has been undergoing testing since 2014, but this was the first satellite it had destroyed.[6] The Outer Space Treaty, which Russia has ratified, bans some types of military activities in space, but not anti-satellite missiles using conventional warheads.[13] The US spokesperson, Ned Price, said the event generated about 1500 pieces of debris that can be tracked by ground-based radars,[10][14] and hundreds of thousands more that are more difficult to track.[9] The debris is expected to continue in orbit for several years, potentially decades.[15] As of 16 November 2021[update], the debris was orbiting at altitudes between 440 to 520 km (270 to 320 miles);[9] by 17 November this range increased to 300 to 1,100 km (190 to 680 miles).[16] NASA administrator Bill Nelson stated that, "With its long and storied history in human spaceflight, it is unthinkable that Russia would endanger not only the American and international partner astronauts on the ISS, but also their own cosmonauts" with two Russian cosmonauts on the ISS out of seven astronaut personnel, and the "actions are reckless and dangerous, threatening as well the Chinese space station."[17] See also[edit] Spaceflight portal 1985 ASM-135 ASAT test – 1985 United States anti-satellite missile test 2007 Chinese anti-satellite missile test Operation Burnt Frost – 2008 United States anti-satellite missile test Mission Shakti – 2019 Indian anti-satellite missile test Kessler syndrome – runaway debris cascade making low Earth orbit inaccessible for centuries Gravity (2013) - movie where a Russian satellite shoot-down creates a catastrophic Kessler syndrome-inciting debris swarm References[edit] ^ a b "Trajectory: Kosmos-1408 1982-092A".

Its orbital period was 97.8 minutes.[1] Destruction[edit] On 15 November 2021, the satellite was destroyed, generating a space debris cloud that threatened the International Space Station.[2] The seven crew members aboard the ISS (four American, two Russian, one German)[7] had to put on their spacesuits[8] and take shelter in the crew capsules[9] so they could quickly return to Earth if debris struck the station.[10] The satellite had been in an orbit at an altitude just above the ISS orbital altitude,[3] and the debris passes by the ISS every 93 minutes.[11] The crew sheltered for only the second and third passes through the debris field, due to an assessment of the debris risk.[12] The debris also poses a risk to other low Earth orbit satellites.[10] The United States Department of State subsequently accused Russia of having targeted Kosmos 1408 during an anti-satellite weapon test, using a ground-based missile against their own defunct satellite,[11] saying that it was "dangerous and irresponsible".[7] The following day, Sergei Shoigu, the Russian minister of defence, acknowledged that the debris was due to a Russian missile test, but argued that it posed no threat to any space activities.[7] The direct-ascent anti-satellite[8] A-235 missile ("Nudol")[6] was launched from Plesetsk Cosmodrome.[10] The system has been undergoing testing since 2014, but this was the first satellite it had destroyed.[6] The Outer Space Treaty, which Russia has ratified, bans some types of military activities in space, but not anti-satellite missiles using conventional warheads.[13] The US spokesperson, Ned Price, said the event generated about 1500 pieces of debris that can be tracked by ground-based radars,[11][14] and hundreds of thousands more that are more difficult to track.[10] The debris is expected to continue in orbit for several years, potentially decades.[15] As of 16 November 2021[update], the debris was orbiting at altitudes between 440 and 520 km (270 and 320 miles);[10] by 17 November this range increased to 300 to 1,100 km (190 to 680 miles).[16] Reactions[edit] NASA administrator Bill Nelson stated that, "With its long and storied history in human spaceflight, it is unthinkable that Russia would endanger not only the American and international partner astronauts on the ISS, but also their own cosmonauts" with two Russian cosmonauts on the ISS out of seven astronaut personnel, and the "actions are reckless and dangerous, threatening as well the Chinese space station."[17][8] The Secure World Foundation, which is dedicated to preserving a safe space environment, noted that other countries have conducted anti-satellite tests in recent years, and called upon the United States, Russia, China, and India to declare unilateral moratoriums on further testing of their antisatellite weapons.[18] See also[edit] Spaceflight portal Anti-satellite missile tests: 1985 ASM-135 ASAT test – United States anti-satellite missile test 2007 Chinese anti-satellite missile test Mission Shakti – 2019 Indian anti-satellite missile test Operation Burnt Frost – 2008 United States anti-satellite missile test Hypothetical: Kessler syndrome – hypothetical runaway debris cascade making low Earth orbit inaccessible for centuries Fictional: Gravity – 2013 science fiction movie in which a Russian satellite shoot-down creates a catastrophic Kessler syndrome-inciting debris swarm References[edit] ^ a b "Trajectory: Kosmos-1408 1982-092A".

It was launched into low Earth orbit on 16 September 1982, at 14:55 UTC, replacing Kosmos 1378. On 15 November 2021, it was destroyed in a Russian anti-satellite weapon test, resulting in space debris in orbits between 300 and 1,100 km (190 and 680 mi) above the Earth. The threat of potential collision with debris forced the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) to take shelter in their escape capsules. Contents 1 Mission 2 Spacecraft 3 Launch 4 Destruction 5 Reactions 6 See also 7 References Mission[edit] From 1965 to 1967 two dedicated ELINT systems were tested: the Tselina-O and Tselina-D. Both reached service, since the Ministry of Defence could not force a single system on the military services. Tselina was developed by Yuzhnoye and consisted of two satellites: Tselina-O for general observations and Tselina-D for detailed observations. ELINT systems for Tselina were first tested under the Kosmos designation in 1962 to 1965. The first Tselina-O was launched in 1970. The Tselina-D took a long time to enter service due to delays in payload development and weight growth. The whole Tselina system was not operational until 1976. Constant improvement resulted in Tselina-O being abandoned in 1984 and all systems being put on Tselina-D.[3] Spacecraft[edit] The satellite was part of the Tselina-D system of ELINT military surveillance satellites.[4][5] It was developed by Yuzhnoye,[3] and had a mass of around 1,750 kg (3,860 lb),[6] and a radius of around 2.5 m (8 ft 2 in),[7] with an expected lifespan of around six months.[8] It replaced Kosmos-1378 in the Tselina system.[3] Launch[edit] The orbital decay of Kosmos-1408 since 1980, compared with the ISS Kosmos-1408 was launched on a Tsyklon-3 launch vehicle on 16 September 1982,[8] from Site 32/2,[9] at the Plesetsk Cosmodrome.[3] It was placed in low Earth orbit, with a perigee of 645 km (401 mi), an apogee of 679 km (422 mi), and an inclination of 82.5°. Its orbital period was 97.8 minutes.[10] It did not have a propulsion system, and its orbit was slowly decaying.[2][1] Destruction[edit] The warning periods coincided with ISS and Kosmos-1408 orbits crossing, by Jonathan McDowell. On 15 November 2021, at around 02:50 UTC,[2] the satellite was destroyed, generating a space debris cloud that threatened the International Space Station.[4] The seven crew members aboard the ISS (four American, two Russian, one German),[11] had to put on their spacesuits,[12] and take shelter in the crew capsules,[13] so they could quickly return to Earth if debris struck the station.[14] The satellite had been in orbit at an altitude just above the ISS orbital altitude,[5] with the debris passing by the ISS every 93 minutes.[15] The crew sheltered for only the second and third passes through the debris field, due to an assessment of the debris risk,[16] and there is no evidence that any debris hit the station.[2] The debris also poses a risk to other low Earth orbit satellites.[14][7] The United States Department of State subsequently accused Russia of having targeted Kosmos 1408 during an anti-satellite weapon test, using a ground-based missile against their own defunct satellite,[15] saying that it was "dangerous and irresponsible".[11] The following day, Sergei Shoigu, the Russian minister of defence, acknowledged that the destruction of the satellite was due to a Russian missile test, but argued that it posed no threat to any space activities.[11] The direct-ascent anti-satellite,[12] A-235 missile ("Nudol"),[9] was launched from Plesetsk Cosmodrome,[14] at around 02:45 UTC.[2] The system has been undergoing testing since 2014, but this was the first satellite it had destroyed.[9] The Outer Space Treaty, which Russia has ratified, bans some types of military activities in space, but not anti-satellite missiles using conventional warheads.[17] The U.S. spokesperson, Ned Price, said the event generated about 1500 pieces of debris that can be tracked by ground-based radars,[15][18] and hundreds of thousands more that are more difficult to track.[14] LeoLabs detected around 300 pieces on 18 November 2021, and also estimated that there were around 1500 ground-trackable pieces in total. They also noted that this is lower than expected compared to other anti-satellite tests, meaning that the pieces are expected to have higher masses so will stay in orbit for longer,[7] and that the lower-than-expected number of debris pieces might be because it was not a hypervelocity collision.[19] The debris is expected to continue in orbit for several years, potentially decades.[20] By 16 November 2021, the debris was orbiting at altitudes between 440 and 520 km (270 and 320 mi);[14] by 17 November 2021 this range increased to 300 to 1,100 km (190 to 680 mi).[21] Reactions[edit] NASA administrator Bill Nelson stated that: "With its long and storied history in human spaceflight, it is unthinkable that Russia would endanger not only the American and international partner astronauts on the ISS, but also their own cosmonauts" with two Russian cosmonauts on the ISS out of seven astronaut personnel, and the "actions are reckless and dangerous, threatening as well the Chinese space station".[22][12] The Secure World Foundation, which is dedicated to preserving a safe space environment, noted that other countries have conducted anti-satellite tests in recent years, and called upon the United States, Russia, China, and India to declare unilateral moratoriums on further testing of their antisatellite weapons.[23] See also[edit] Wikimedia Commons has media related to Kosmos 1408.

It was launched into low Earth orbit on 16 September 1982, at 14:55 UTC, replacing Kosmos-1378. On 15 November 2021, it was destroyed in a Russian anti-satellite weapon test, resulting in space debris in orbits between 300 and 1,100 km (190 and 680 mi) above the Earth. The threat of potential collision with debris forced the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) to take shelter in their escape capsules.

Both reached service, since the Ministry of Defence could not force a single system on the military services. Tselina was developed by Yuzhnoye and consisted of two satellites: Tselina-O for general observations and Tselina-D for detailed observations. ELINT systems for Tselina were first tested under the Kosmos designation in 1962 to 1965. The first Tselina-O was launched in 1970. The Tselina-D took a long time to enter service because of delays in payload development and weight growth. The whole Tselina system was not operational until 1976. Constant improvement resulted in Tselina-O being abandoned in 1984 and all systems being put on Tselina-D.[3] Spacecraft[edit] The satellite was part of the Tselina-D system of ELINT military surveillance satellites.[4][5] It was developed by Yuzhnoye,[3] and had a mass of around 1,750 kg (3,860 lb),[6] and a radius of around 2.5 m (8 ft 2 in),[7] with an expected lifespan of around six months.[8] It replaced Kosmos-1378 in the Tselina system.[3] Launch[edit] The orbital decay of Kosmos-1408 since 1980, compared with the ISS Kosmos-1408 was launched on a Tsyklon-3 launch vehicle on 16 September 1982,[8] from Site 32/2,[9] at the Plesetsk Cosmodrome.[3] It was placed in low Earth orbit, with a perigee of 645 km (401 mi), an apogee of 679 km (422 mi), and an inclination of 82.5°. Its orbital period was 97.8 minutes.[10] It did not have a propulsion system, and its orbit was slowly decaying.[2][1] Destruction[edit] The warning periods coincided with ISS and Kosmos-1408 orbits crossing, by Jonathan McDowell. On 15 November 2021, at around 02:50 UTC,[2] the satellite was destroyed as part of an anti-satellite weapons test by Russia, generating a space debris cloud that threatened the International Space Station.[11][4] The seven crew members aboard the ISS (four American, two Russian, one German)[11] were told to put on their spacesuits[12] and take shelter in the crew capsules[13] so they could quickly return to Earth if debris struck the station.[14] The satellite had been in orbit at an altitude ~50 kilometers (~30 miles) above the ISS orbital altitude,[5] with the debris intersecting the orbit of the ISS every 93 minutes.[15] The crew sheltered for only the second and third passes through the debris field, based on an assessment of the debris risk.[16] There is no evidence that any debris hit the station.[2] The debris can also pose a risk to other low Earth orbit satellites.[14][7] The United States Department of State subsequently accused Russia of having targeted Kosmos 1408 during an anti-satellite weapon test, using a ground-based missile against their own defunct satellite,[15] saying that it was "dangerous and irresponsible".[11] The following day, Sergei Shoigu, the Russian minister of defense, acknowledged that the destruction of the satellite was due to a Russian missile test, but argued that it posed no threat to any space activities.[11] The direct-ascent anti-satellite[12] A-235 "Nudol" anti-ballistic missile[9] was launched from Plesetsk Cosmodrome[14] at around 02:45 UTC.[2] The system has been undergoing testing since 2014, but this was the first satellite it has destroyed.[9] The Outer Space Treaty, which Russia has ratified, bans some types of military activities in space, but not anti-satellite missiles using conventional warheads.[17] U.S. spokesperson Ned Price said the event generated about 1500 pieces of debris that can be tracked by ground-based radar,[15][18] and hundreds of thousands more that are more difficult to track.[14] LeoLabs detected around 300 pieces on 18 November 2021, and also estimated that there were around 1500 ground-trackable pieces in total. They also noted that this is lower than expected compared to other anti-satellite tests, meaning that the pieces are expected to have higher masses so will stay in orbit for longer,[7] and that the lower-than-expected number of debris pieces might be because it was not a hypervelocity collision.[19] The debris is expected to continue to orbit for several years, potentially decades.[20] By 16 November 2021, the debris was orbiting at altitudes between 440 and 520 km (270 and 320 mi);[14] by 17 November 2021 this range increased to 300 to 1,100 km (190 to 680 mi).[21] Reactions[edit] NASA administrator Bill Nelson stated that: "With its long and storied history in human spaceflight, it is unthinkable that Russia would endanger not only the American and international partner astronauts on the ISS, but also their own cosmonauts" with two Russian cosmonauts on the ISS out of seven astronaut personnel, and the "actions are reckless and dangerous, threatening as well the Chinese space station".[22][12] The Secure World Foundation, a U.S. think tank, called upon the United States, Russia, China, and India to declare unilateral moratoriums on further testing of their antisatellite weapons.[23] See also[edit] Wikimedia Commons has media related to Kosmos 1408.
