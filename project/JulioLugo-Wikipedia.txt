the Youth Service League in Brooklyn; alumni of that program include Manny Ramírez and Shawon Dunston.[3] He went on to play college baseball at Connors State College in Oklahoma.[4] Houston Astros[edit] The Houston Astros selected Lugo in the 43rd round of the 1994 MLB draft, although he did not sign with the team until May 1995.[5] He made his professional debut in 1995 with the Auburn Astros, a Class A Short Season team in the New York–Penn League; appearing in 59 games, he had a .291 batting average with one home run and 16 runs batted in (RBIs).[6] He advanced through the Houston farm system, reaching the Triple-A level in 2000 with the New Orleans Zephyrs.[6] Early that season, Lugo was promoted to the major-league Astros,[7] and made his MLB debut on April 15, 2000.[8] Lugo played in 116 games for the Astros that year, batting .283 with 10 home runs and 40 RBIs.[9] He made appearances at shortstop, second base, all three outfield positions, and designated hitter.[9] In

wife.[11] He was designated for assignment and subsequently released by the Astros.[12] Lugo had appeared with 22 games that season with Houston.[9] Overall, Lugo appeared in 366 games for the Astros, batting .268 with 28 home runs and 114 RBIs.[9] He appeared in one postseason series with Houston, the 2001 National League Division Series, batting 0-for-8 in three games.[9] Tampa Bay Devil

she had instigated the incident and he did not intend to hurt her.[14] Lugo appeared in 117 games with the Rays through the end of the season, batting .275 with 15 home runs and 53 RBIs.[9] He hit home runs in four consecutive games against the Toronto Blue Jays during September 22–25.[15] In 2004, Lugo batted .275 with seven home runs and 75 RBIs in 157 games.[9] The following season, he

time, Lugo had a .189 batting average.[20] Since 1996, only Greg Vaughn—who had a .163 average with Tampa Bay on June 27, 2002—had a lower batting average with more than 250 at bats 80 games into a

and 73 RBIs in 147 games.[9] The Red Sox advanced to the World Series where they swept the Colorado Rockies in four games;[23] Lugo played in 14 postseason games with Boston,[9] while batting .385 (5-for-13) in the World Series.[24] During 2008, Lugo committed 16 errors through July 5,[25] nearly one-third of the 50 errors made by the Red Sox as a team to that point in the season.[26] Six days later, Lugo injured his left quad running out a hit;[27] he was placed on the disabled list and missed the rest of the season.[28] In 82 games, he batted .268 with one home run and 22 RBIs.[9] On March 17, 2009, Lugo underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right knee to repair a torn meniscus cartilage.[29] He returned to the team in late April, batting .284 in 37 games through early July,[30][9] while committing seven errors.[31] On July 17, Lugo was designated for assignment by the Red Sox.[32] Overall during 2007–2009 with the Red Sox, Lugo appeared in 266 games while batting .251 with 10 home runs and 103 RBIs.[9] Later career[edit] On July 22, 2009, Lugo was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals for Chris Duncan and cash considerations.[33] In 51 games with the Cardinals through the end of the season, Lugo batted .277 with two home runs and 13 RBIs.[9] Defensively, he split time between shortstop (24 appearances) and second base (30 appearances).[9] He batted 2-for-5 in three games of the 2009 National League Division Series, which the Cardinals lost to the Dodgers.[9] On April 1, 2010, Lugo was traded to the Baltimore Orioles for a player to be named later.[34] He batted .249 in 93 games with no home runs and 20 RBIs during the season.[9] He was used primarily at second base (59 appearances) while also seeing time at shortstop, third base, left field, and designated hitter.[9] Lugo signed a minor-league contract with the Atlanta Braves on May 23, 2011.[35] He was added to the Braves' major-league roster when they purchased his contract on June 21.[36] In 22 games with Atlanta, Lugo batted .136 (6-for-44) with no home runs and three RBIs.[9] The Braves released Lugo on September 2.[37] On January 21, 2012, Lugo agreed to a minor league contract with the Cleveland Indians with an invitation to spring training.[38] On January 30, the deal was reported to have fallen apart and he remained a free agent.[39] Lugo did not play professionally during the 2012 regular season.[9] His final season was in 2013, as a member of the Peoria Explorers of the Freedom Pro Baseball League, an independent baseball league.[40] In 1352 MLB games over 12 seasons, Lugo batted .269 with 80 home runs and 475 RBIs; he stole 198 bases.[9] In eight minor-league seasons, he batted .294 with 39 home runs and 250 RBIs in 570 games.[6] He also played three seasons in

Lugo was born in the Dominican Republic and at age 13 moved to Sunset Park, Brooklyn, where he attended Fort Hamilton High School.[1] In addition to playing baseball for Fort Hamilton,[2] he played in the Youth Service League in Brooklyn; alumni of that program include Manny Ramírez and Shawon Dunston.[3] He went on to play college baseball at Connors State College in Oklahoma.[4] Houston Astros[edit] The Houston Astros selected Lugo in the 43rd round of the 1994 MLB draft, although he did not sign with the team until May 1995.[5] He made his professional debut in 1995 with the Auburn Astros, a Class A Short Season team in the New York–Penn League; appearing in 59 games, he had a .291 batting average with one home run and 16 runs batted in (RBIs).[6] He advanced through the Houston farm system, reaching the Triple-A level in 2000 with the New Orleans Zephyrs.[6] Early that season, Lugo was promoted to the major-league Astros,[7] and made his MLB debut on April 15, 2000.[8] Lugo played in 116 games for the Astros that year, batting .283 with 10 home runs and 40 RBIs.[9] He made appearances at shortstop, second base, all three outfield positions, and designated hitter.[9] In 2001, Lugo played in 140 games, batting .263 with 10 home runs and 37 RBIs.[9] The following season, he batted .261 with eight home runs and 35 RBIs in 88 games.[9] In mid-August, Lugo's left arm was broken when he was hit by a pitch from Kerry Wood of the Chicago Cubs, ending his 2002 season.[10] On April 30, 2003, Lugo was arrested after a game at Minute Maid Park and charged with assaulting his wife.[11] He was designated for assignment and subsequently released by the Astros.[12] Lugo had appeared with 22 games that season with Houston.[9] Overall, Lugo appeared in 366 games for the Astros, batting .268 with 28 home runs and 114 RBIs.[9] He appeared in one postseason series with Houston, the 2001 National League Division Series, batting 0-for-8 in three games.[9] Tampa Bay Devil Rays[edit] In mid-May 2003, Lugo signed with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.[13] In mid-July, he was acquitted of the assault charges after his then-wife (the couple had filed for divorce) testified that she had instigated the incident and he did not intend to hurt her.[14] Lugo appeared in 117 games with the Rays through the end of the season, batting .275 with 15 home runs and 53 RBIs.[9] He hit home runs in four consecutive games against the Toronto Blue Jays during September 22–25.[15] In 2004, Lugo batted .275 with seven home runs and 75 RBIs in 157 games.[9] The following season, he

of his home runs came in a single inning, the fifth, of a home game against the Baltimore Orioles on July 22.[16] Overall with Tampa Bay in parts of four seasons, Lugo had a .287 average with 40 home

time, Lugo had a .189 batting average.[20] Since 1996, only Greg Vaughn—who had a .163 average with Tampa Bay on June 27, 2002—had a lower batting average with more than 250 at bats 80 games into a

his average from .189 to .226.[5] He had a streak of 20 consecutive stolen bases that ended on July 2, setting a club record.[22] Lugo ended the regular season with a .237 average with eight home runs and 73 RBIs in 147 games.[9] The Red Sox advanced to the World Series where they swept the Colorado Rockies in four games;[23] Lugo played in 14 postseason games with Boston,[9] while batting .385 (5-for-13) in the World Series.[24] During 2008, Lugo committed 16 errors through July 5,[25] nearly one-third of the 50 errors made by the Red Sox as a team to that point in the season.[26] Six days later, Lugo injured his left quad running out a hit;[27] he was placed on the disabled list and missed the rest of the season.[28] In 82 games, he batted .268 with one home run and 22 RBIs.[9] On March 17, 2009, Lugo underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right knee to repair a torn meniscus cartilage.[29] He returned to the team in late April, batting .284 in 37 games through early July,[30][9] while committing seven errors.[31] On July 17, Lugo was designated for assignment by the Red Sox.[32] Overall during 2007–2009 with the Red Sox, Lugo appeared in 266 games while batting .251 with 10 home runs and 103 RBIs.[9] Later career[edit] On July 22, 2009, Lugo was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals for Chris Duncan and cash considerations.[33] In 51 games with the Cardinals through the end of the season, Lugo batted .277 with two home runs and 13 RBIs.[9] Defensively, he split time between shortstop (24 appearances) and second base (30 appearances).[9] He batted 2-for-5 in three games of the 2009 National League Division Series, which the Cardinals lost to the Dodgers.[9] On April 1, 2010, Lugo was traded to the Baltimore Orioles for a player to be named later.[34] He batted .249 in 93 games with no home runs and 20 RBIs during the season.[9] He was used primarily at second base (59 appearances) while also seeing time at shortstop, third base, left field, and designated hitter.[9] Lugo signed a minor-league contract with the Atlanta Braves on May 23, 2011.[35] He was added to the Braves' major-league roster when they purchased his contract on June 21.[36] In 22 games with Atlanta, Lugo batted .136 (6-for-44) with no home runs and three RBIs.[9] The Braves released Lugo on September 2.[37] On January 21, 2012, Lugo agreed to a minor league contract with the Cleveland Indians with an invitation to spring training.[38] On January 30, the deal was reported to have fallen apart and he remained a free agent.[39] Lugo did not play professionally during the 2012 regular season.[9] His final season was in 2013, as a member of the Peoria Explorers of the Freedom Pro Baseball League, an independent baseball league.[40] In 1352 MLB games over 12 seasons, Lugo batted .269 with 80 home runs and 475 RBIs; he stole 198 bases.[9] In eight minor-league seasons, he batted .294 with 39 home runs and 250 RBIs in 570 games.[6] He also played three seasons in the Dominican Winter League for Leones del Escogido, and played for the Dominican Republic three times in the Caribbean Series.[6] Personal life[edit] Lugo and his wife had one son and two daughters; he also had an older son with his former spouse.[41] In 2013, Lugo was inducted to the Connors State College athletic hall of fame.[42] In 2018, the Boston Red Sox held their first alumni game since 1993;[43] Lugo hit a two-run homer off of Pedro Martínez for the only runs in the game.[44] Lugo died of a heart attack on November 15, 2021, one day before his 46th birthday.[45][46] References[edit]
