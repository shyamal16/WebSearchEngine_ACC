Emperor of the Romans Imperator Romanorum Kaiser der Römer Imperial Double-headed Reichsadler used by the Habsburg emperors of the early modern period First to reign Charlemagne 25 December AD 800 – 28 January AD 814 Details First monarch Charlemagne (AD 800 formation) Otto the Great (AD 962 formation) Last monarch Francis II Formation 25 December 800 Abolition 6 August 1806 The Holy Roman Emperor, originally and officially the Emperor of the Romans (Latin: Imperator Romanorum, German: Kaiser der Römer) during the middle ages, and also known as the German-Roman Emperor since the early modern period[1] (Latin: Imperator Germanorum, German: Römisch-deutscher Kaiser, lit.?'Roman-German emperor'), was the ruler and head of state of the Holy Roman Empire. The empire was considered by the Roman Catholic Church to be the only legal successor of the Roman Empire during the Middle Ages and the early modern period. The title was held in conjunction with the title of king of Italy (Rex Italiae) from the 8th to the 16th century, and, almost without interruption, with the title of king of Germany (Rex Teutonicorum, lit. “King of the Teutons”) throughout the 12th to 18th centuries.[2] In theory and diplomacy, the emperors were considered primus inter pares, regarded as first among equals among other Roman Catholic monarchs across Europe.[3] In practice, an emperor was only as strong as his army and alliances, including marriage alliances, made him. However, the Reformation of the 16th century had made managing the empire more difficult because it made the empire's role as "holy" questionable in Protestant parts of Europe. From an autocracy in Carolingian times (AD 800–924) the title by the 13th century evolved into an elective monarchy, with the emperor chosen by the prince-electors. Various royal houses of Europe, at different times, became de facto hereditary holders of the title, notably the Ottonians (962–1024) and the Salians (1027–1125). Following the late medieval crisis of government, the Habsburgs kept possession of the title without interruption from 1440 to 1740. The final emperors were from the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, from 1765 to 1806. The Holy Roman Empire was dissolved by Francis II, after a devastating defeat by Napoleon at the Battle of Austerlitz. The emperor was widely perceived to rule by divine right, though he often contradicted or rivaled the pope, most notably during the Investiture controversy. The Holy Roman Empire never had an empress regnant, though women such as Theophanu and Maria Theresa exerted strong influence. Throughout its history, the position was viewed as a defender of the Roman Catholic faith. Until Maximilian I in 1508, the emperor-elect (Imperator electus) was required to be crowned by the pope before assuming the imperial title. Charles V was the last to be crowned by the pope in 1530. Even after the Reformation, the elected emperor was always a Roman Catholic. There were short periods in history when the electoral college was dominated by Protestants, and the electors usually voted in their own political interest.

Further information: Emperor, Translatio imperii, and Problem of two emperors From the time of Constantine I (r. 306–337), the Roman emperors had, with very few exceptions, taken on a role as promoters and defenders of Christianity. The reign of Constantine established a precedent for the position of the Christian emperor in the Church. Emperors considered themselves responsible to the gods for the spiritual health of their subjects, and after Constantine they had a duty to help the Church define and maintain orthodoxy. The emperor's role was to enforce doctrine, root out heresy, and uphold ecclesiastical unity.[4] Both the title and connection between Emperor and Church continued in the Eastern Roman Empire throughout the medieval period (in exile during 1204–1261). The ecumenical councils of the 5th to 8th centuries were convoked by the Eastern Roman Emperors.[5] In Western Europe, the title of Emperor in the West lapsed after the death of Julius Nepos in 480, although the rulers of the barbarian kingdoms continued to recognize the authority of the Eastern Emperor at least nominally well into the 6th century. While the reconquest of Justinian I had reestablished Byzantine presence in Italy, religious frictions existed with the Papacy who sought dominance over the Constantinople Church. Toward the end of the 8th century the Papacy still recognised the ruler at Constantinople as the Roman Emperor, though Byzantine military support in Italy had increasingly waned, leading to the Papacy to look to the Franks for protection. In 800 Pope Leo III owed a great debt to Charlemagne, the King of the Franks and King of Italy, for securing his life and position. By this time, the Eastern Emperor Constantine VI has been deposed in 797 and replaced as monarch by his mother, Irene.[6] Under the pretext that a woman cannot rule the empire, Pope Leo III declared the throne vacant and crowned Charlemagne Emperor of the Romans (Imperator Romanorum), the successor of Constantine VI as Roman emperor under the concept of translatio imperii.[6] On his coins, the name and title used by Charlemagne is Karolus Imperator Augustus and in his documents, he used Imperator Augustus Romanum gubernans Imperium ("August Emperor, governing the Roman Empire") and serenissimus Augustus a Deo coronatus, magnus pacificus Imperator Romanorum gubernans Imperium ("most serene Augustus crowned by God, great peaceful emperor governing the empire of the Romans"). The Eastern Empire eventually relented to recognizing Charlemagne and his successors as emperors, but as "Frankish" and "German emperors", at no point referring to them as Roman, a label they reserved for themselves.[7] The title of emperor in the West implied recognition by the pope. As the power of the papacy grew during the Middle Ages, popes and emperors came into conflict over church administration. The best-known and most bitter conflict was that known as the investiture controversy, fought during the 11th century between Henry IV and Pope Gregory VII. After the coronation of Charlemagne, his successors maintained the title until the death of Berengar I of Italy in 924. The comparatively brief interregnum between 924 and the coronation of Otto the Great in 962 is taken as marking the transition from the Frankish Empire to the Holy Roman Empire. Under the Ottonians, much of the former Carolingian kingdom of Eastern Francia fell within the boundaries of the Holy Roman Empire. Since 911, the various German princes had elected the King of the Germans from among their peers. The King of the Germans would then be crowned as emperor following the precedent set by Charlemagne, during the period of 962–1530. Charles V was the last emperor to be crowned by the pope, and his successor, Ferdinand I, merely adopted the title of "Emperor elect" in 1558. The final Holy Roman emperor-elect, Francis II, abdicated in 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars that saw the Empire's final dissolution. The term sacrum (i.e., "holy") in connection with the German Roman Empire was first used in 1157 under Frederick I Barbarossa.[8] The Holy Roman Emperor's standard designation was "August Emperor of the Romans" (Romanorum Imperator Augustus). When Charlemagne was crowned in 800, he was styled as "most serene Augustus, crowned by God, great and pacific emperor, governing the Roman Empire," thus constituting the elements of "Holy" and "Roman" in the imperial title.[9] The word Roman was a reflection of the principle of translatio imperii (or in this case restauratio imperii) that regarded the (Germanic) Holy Roman emperors as the inheritors of the title of emperor of the Western Roman Empire, despite the continued existence of the Eastern Roman Empire. In German-language historiography, the term Römisch-deutscher Kaiser ("Roman-German emperor") is used to distinguish the title from that of Roman emperor on one hand, and that of German emperor (Deutscher Kaiser) on the other. The English term "Holy Roman Emperor" is a modern shorthand for "emperor of the Holy Roman Empire" not corresponding to the historical style or title, i.e., the adjective "holy" is not intended as modifying "emperor"; the English term "Holy Roman Emperor" gained currency in the interbellum period (the 1920s to 1930s); formerly the title had also been rendered "German-Roman emperor" in English.[1] Succession[edit] Further information: Imperial election, Italienzug, and Family tree of the German monarchs Illustration of the election of Henry VII (27 November 1308) showing (left to right) the Archbishop of Cologne, Archbishop of Mainz, Archbishop of Trier, Count Palatine of the Rhine, Duke of Saxony, Margrave of Brandenburg and King of Bohemia (Codex Balduini Trevirorum, c. 1340). The elective monarchy of the kingdom of Germany goes back to the early 10th century, the election of Conrad I of Germany in 911 following the death without issue of Louis the Child, the last Carolingian ruler of Germany. Elections meant the kingship of Germany was only partially hereditary, unlike the kingship of France, although sovereignty frequently remained in a dynasty until there were no more male successors. The process of an election meant that the prime candidate had to make concessions, by which the voters were kept on his side, which was known as Wahlkapitulationen (electoral capitulation). Conrad was elected by the German dukes, and it is not known precisely when the system of seven prince-electors was established. The papal decree Venerabilem by Innocent III (1202), addressed to Berthold V, Duke of Zähringen, establishes the election procedure by (unnamed) princes of the realm, reserving for the pope the right to approve of the candidates. A letter of Pope Urban IV (1263), in the context of the disputed vote of 1256 and the subsequent interregnum, suggests that by "immemorial custom", seven princes had the right to elect the king and future emperor. The seven prince-electors are named in the Golden Bull of 1356: the archbishop of Mainz, the archbishop of Trier, the archbishop of Cologne, the king of Bohemia, the count palatine of the Rhine, the duke of Saxony and the margrave of Brandenburg. After 1438, the kings remained in the house of Habsburg and Habsburg-Lorraine, with the brief exception of Charles VII, who was a Wittelsbach. Maximilian I (emperor 1508–1519) and his successors no longer travelled to Rome to be crowned as emperor by the pope. Maximilian, therefore, named himself elected Roman emperor (Erwählter Römischer Kaiser) in 1508 with papal approval. This title was in use by all his uncrowned successors. Of his successors, only Charles V, the immediate one, received a papal coronation. The elector palatine's seat was conferred on the duke of Bavaria in 1621, but in 1648, in the wake of the Thirty Years' War, the elector palatine was restored, as the eighth elector. Electorate of Hanover was added as a ninth elector in 1692. The whole college was reshuffled in the German mediatization of 1803 with a total of ten electors, a mere three years before the dissolution of the Empire. List of emperors[edit] See also: List of German monarchs This list includes all 47 German monarchs crowned from Charlemagne until the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire (800–1806). Several rulers were crowned king of the Romans (king of Germany) but not emperor, although they styled themselves thus, among whom were: Conrad I and Henry the Fowler in the 10th century, and Conrad IV, Rudolf I, Adolf and Albert I during the interregnum of the late 13th century. Traditional historiography assumes a continuity between the Carolingian Empire and the Holy Roman Empire, while a modern convention takes the coronation of Otto I in 962 as the starting point of the Holy Roman Empire (although the term Sacrum Imperium Romanum was not in use before the 13th century). Frankish emperors[edit] Further information: List of Frankish kings § Carolingians The rulers who were crowned as Holy Roman Emperors between AD 800 and 915 were as follows: 800–888: Carolingian dynasty[edit] Main article: Carolingian dynasty Portrait Name Lifespan Reign Relationship with predecessor(s) Other title(s) Charlemagne (Charles I) 742–814 25 December 800 28 January 814 King of the Franks King of the Lombards Louis I, the Pious 778–840 11 September 813[10] 20 June 840 Son of Charles I King of the Franks King of Italy King of Aquitaine Lothair I 795–855 5 April 823 29 September 855 Son of Louis I King of Italy King of Middle Francia Louis II 825–875 29 September 855 12 August 875 Son of Lothair I King of Italy Charles II, the Bald 823–877 29 December 875 6 October 877 Son of Louis I, younger brother of Lothair I King of West Francia King of Italy Charles III, the Fat 839–888 12 February 881 13 January 888 Grandson of Louis I King of West Francia King of East Francia King of Italy 891–898: Widonid dynasty[edit] Main article: Widonids Portrait Name Lifespan Reign Relationship with predecessor(s) Other title(s) Guy I ?–894 21 February 891 12 December 894 Great-great-grandson of Charles I King of Italy Duke of Spoleto Lambert I 880–898 30 April 892 15 October 898 Son of Guy I King of Italy Duke of Spoleto 896–899: Carolingian dynasty[edit] Portrait Name Lifespan Reign Relationship with predecessor(s) Other title(s) Arnulph 850–899 22 February 896 8 December 899 Nephew of Charles III King of Italy King of East Francia 901–905: Bosonid dynasty[edit] Main article: Bosonids Portrait Name Lifespan Reign Relationship with predecessor(s) Other title(s) Louis III, the Blind 880–928 22 February 901 21 July 905 Grandson of Louis II King of Italy King of Provence 915–924: Unruoching dynasty[edit] Main article: Unruochings Portrait Name Lifespan Reign Relationship with predecessor(s) Other title(s) Berengar I 845–924 December 915 7 April 924 Grandson of Louis I King of Italy Margrave of Friuli Holy Roman Emperors[edit] There was no Holy Roman emperor between 924 and 962. While earlier Germanic and Italian monarchs had been crowned as Roman emperors, the actual Holy Roman Empire is usually considered to have begun with the crowning of the Saxon king Otto I. It was officially an elective position, though at times it ran in families, notably the four generations of the Salian dynasty in the 11th century. From the end of the Salian dynasty through the middle 15th century, the emperors drew from many different German dynasties, and it was rare for the throne to pass from father to son. That changed with the ascension of the Austrian House of Habsburg, as an unbroken line of Habsburgs held the imperial throne until the 18th century. Later a cadet branch known as the House of Habsburg-Lorraine passed it from father to son until the abolition of the Empire in 1806. Notably, the Habsburgs dispensed with the requirement that emperors be crowned by the pope before exercising their office. Starting with Ferdinand I, all successive emperors forwent the traditional coronation. 962–1024: Ottonian dynasty[edit] Main article: Ottonian dynasty Portrait Name Lifespan King Emperor Ended Relationship with predecessor(s) Other title(s) Otto I, the Great 912–973 7 August 936 2 February 962 7 May 973 King of Italy King of Germany Duke of Saxony Otto II, the Red 955–983 26 May 961 25 December 967 7 December 983 Son of Otto I King of Italy King of Germany Otto III 980–1002 25 December 983 21 May 996 23 January 1002 Son of Otto II King of Italy King of Germany Henry II[note 1] 973–1024 7 June 1002 14 February 1014 13 July 1024 Second cousin of Otto III King of Italy King of Germany Duke of Bavaria Duke of Carinthia 1027–1125: Salian dynasty[edit] Main article: Salian dynasty Portrait Name Lifespan King Emperor Ended Relationship with predecessor(s) Other title(s) Conrad II, the Elder[note 2] 990–1039 8 September 1024 26 March 1027 4 June 1039 Great-great-grandson of Otto I King of Burgundy King of Italy King of Germany Henry III, the Black 1017–1056 14 April 1028 25 December 1046 5 October 1056 Son of Conrad II King of Burgundy King of Italy King of Germany Duke of Bavaria Duke of Swabia Duke of Carinthia Margrave of Meissen Henry IV 1050–1106 17 July 1054 1 April 1084 7 August 1106 Son of Henry III King of Burgundy King of Italy King of Germany Duke of Bavaria Henry V[11] 1086–1125 6 January 1099 13 April 1111 23 May 1125 Son of Henry IV King of Italy King of Germany King of Burgundy 1133–1137: Supplinburg dynasty[edit] Portrait Name Lifespan King Emperor Ended Relationship with predecessor(s) Other title(s) Lothair II[note 3] 1075–1137 30 August 1125 4 June 1133 4 December 1137 Great-great-great-great-great-great-grandnephew of Otto I King of Italy King of Germany King of Burgundy Duke of Saxony 1155–1197: Staufen dynasty[edit] Main article: Hohenstaufen Portrait Name Lifespan King Emperor Ended Relationship with predecessor(s) Other title(s) Frederick I Barbarossa 1122–1190 4 March 1152 18 June 1155 10 June 1190 Great-grandson of Henry IV King of Germany King of Italy King of Burgundy Henry VI 1165–1197 15 August 1169 14 April 1191 28 September 1197 Son of Frederick I King of Germany King of Italy King of Burgundy Co-King of Sicily 1198–1215: Welf dynasty[edit] Main article: House of Welf Portrait Coat of arms Name Lifespan King Emperor Ended Relationship with predecessor(s) Other title(s) Otto IV 1175–1218 9 June 1198 21 October 1209 1215 Great-grandson of Lothair II King of Germany King of Italy King of Burgundy 1220–1250: Staufen dynasty[edit] Portrait Name Lifespan King Emperor Ended Relationship with predecessor(s) Other title(s) Frederick II, Stupor Mundi 1194–1250 5 December 1212 22 November 1220 13 December 1250 Son of Henry VI King of Germany King of Italy King of Sicily King of Jerusalem The interregnum of the Holy Roman Empire is taken to have lasted from the deposition of Frederick II by Pope Innocent IV (1245, alternatively from the death of Frederick 1250 or the death of Conrad IV 1254) to the election of Rudolf I of Germany (1273). Rudolf was not crowned emperor, nor were his successors Adolf and Albert.

Emperor of the Romans Imperator Romanorum Kaiser der Römer Imperial Double-headed Reichsadler used by the Habsburg emperors of the early modern period First to reign Charlemagne 25 December AD 800 – 28 January AD 814 Details First monarch Charlemagne (AD 800 formation) Otto the Great (AD 962 formation) Last monarch Francis II Formation 25 December 800 Abolition 6 August 1806 The Holy Roman Emperor, originally and officially the Emperor of the Romans (Latin: Imperator Romanorum, German: Kaiser der Römer) during the middle ages, and also known as the German-Roman Emperor since the early modern period[1] (Latin: Imperator Germanorum, German: Römisch-deutscher Kaiser, lit.?'Roman-German emperor'), was the ruler and head of state of the Holy Roman Empire. The empire was considered by the Roman Catholic Church to be the only legal successor of the Roman Empire during the Middle Ages and the early modern period. The title was held in conjunction with the title of king of Italy (Rex Italiae) from the 8th to the 16th century, and, almost without interruption, with the title of king of Germany (Rex Teutonicorum, lit. “King of the Teutons”) throughout the 12th to 18th centuries.[2] In theory and diplomacy, the emperors were considered primus inter pares, regarded as first among equals among other Roman Catholic monarchs across Europe.[3] In practice, an emperor was only as strong as his army and alliances, including marriage alliances, made him. However, the Reformation of the 16th century had made managing the empire more difficult because it made the empire's role as "holy" questionable in Protestant parts of Europe. From an autocracy in Carolingian times (AD 800–924) the title by the 13th century evolved into an elective monarchy, with the emperor chosen by the prince-electors. Various royal houses of Europe, at different times, became de facto hereditary holders of the title, notably the Ottonians (962–1024) and the Salians (1027–1125). Following the late medieval crisis of government, the Habsburgs kept possession of the title without interruption from 1440 to 1740. The final emperors were from the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, from 1765 to 1806. The Holy Roman Empire was dissolved by Francis II, after a devastating defeat by Napoleon at the Battle of Austerlitz. The emperor was widely perceived to rule by divine right, though he often contradicted or rivaled the pope, most notably during the Investiture controversy. The Holy Roman Empire never had an empress regnant, though women such as Theophanu and Maria Theresa exerted strong influence. Throughout its history, the position was viewed as a defender of the Roman Catholic faith. Until Maximilian I in 1508, the emperor-elect (Imperator electus) was required to be crowned by the pope before assuming the imperial title. Charles V was the last to be crowned by the pope in 1530. Even after the Reformation, the elected emperor was always a Roman Catholic. There were short periods in history when the electoral college was dominated by Protestants, and the electors usually voted in their own political interest.

Further information: Emperor, Translatio imperii, and Problem of two emperors From the time of Constantine I (r. 306–337), the Roman emperors had, with very few exceptions, taken on a role as promoters and defenders of Christianity. The reign of Constantine established a precedent for the position of the Christian emperor in the Church. Emperors considered themselves responsible to the gods for the spiritual health of their subjects, and after Constantine they had a duty to help the Church define and maintain orthodoxy. The emperor's role was to enforce doctrine, root out heresy, and uphold ecclesiastical unity.[4] Both the title and connection between Emperor and Church continued in the Eastern Roman Empire throughout the medieval period (in exile during 1204–1261). The ecumenical councils of the 5th to 8th centuries were convoked by the Eastern Roman Emperors.[5] In Western Europe, the title of Emperor in the West lapsed after the death of Julius Nepos in 480, although the rulers of the barbarian kingdoms continued to recognize the authority of the Eastern Emperor at least nominally well into the 6th century. While the reconquest of Justinian I had reestablished Byzantine presence in Italy, religious frictions existed with the Papacy who sought dominance over the Constantinople Church. Toward the end of the 8th century the Papacy still recognised the ruler at Constantinople as the Roman Emperor, though Byzantine military support in Italy had increasingly waned, leading to the Papacy to look to the Franks for protection. In 800 Pope Leo III owed a great debt to Charlemagne, the King of the Franks and King of Italy, for securing his life and position. By this time, the Eastern Emperor Constantine VI has been deposed in 797 and replaced as monarch by his mother, Irene.[6] Under the pretext that a woman cannot rule the empire, Pope Leo III declared the throne vacant and crowned Charlemagne Emperor of the Romans (Imperator Romanorum), the successor of Constantine VI as Roman emperor under the concept of translatio imperii.[6] On his coins, the name and title used by Charlemagne is Karolus Imperator Augustus and in his documents, he used Imperator Augustus Romanum gubernans Imperium ("August Emperor, governing the Roman Empire") and serenissimus Augustus a Deo coronatus, magnus pacificus Imperator Romanorum gubernans Imperium ("most serene Augustus crowned by God, great peaceful emperor governing the empire of the Romans"). The Eastern Empire eventually relented to recognizing Charlemagne and his successors as emperors, but as "Frankish" and "German emperors", at no point referring to them as Roman, a label they reserved for themselves.[7] The title of emperor in the West implied recognition by the pope. As the power of the papacy grew during the Middle Ages, popes and emperors came into conflict over church administration. The best-known and most bitter conflict was that known as the investiture controversy, fought during the 11th century between Henry IV and Pope Gregory VII. After the coronation of Charlemagne, his successors maintained the title until the death of Berengar I of Italy in 924. The comparatively brief interregnum between 924 and the coronation of Otto the Great in 962 is taken as marking the transition from the Frankish Empire to the Holy Roman Empire. Under the Ottonians, much of the former Carolingian kingdom of Eastern Francia fell within the boundaries of the Holy Roman Empire. Since 911, the various German princes had elected the King of the Germans from among their peers. The King of the Germans would then be crowned as emperor following the precedent set by Charlemagne, during the period of 962–1530. Charles V was the last emperor to be crowned by the pope, and his successor, Ferdinand I, merely adopted the title of "Emperor elect" in 1558. The final Holy Roman emperor-elect, Francis II, abdicated in 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars that saw the Empire's final dissolution. The term sacrum (i.e., "holy") in connection with the German Roman Empire was first used in 1157 under Frederick I Barbarossa.[8] The Holy Roman Emperor's standard designation was "August Emperor of the Romans" (Romanorum Imperator Augustus). When Charlemagne was crowned in 800, he was styled as "most serene Augustus, crowned by God, great and pacific emperor, governing the Roman Empire," thus constituting the elements of "Holy" and "Roman" in the imperial title.[9] The word Roman was a reflection of the principle of translatio imperii (or in this case restauratio imperii) that regarded the (Germanic) Holy Roman emperors as the inheritors of the title of emperor of the Western Roman Empire, despite the continued existence of the Eastern Roman Empire. In German-language historiography, the term Römisch-deutscher Kaiser ("Roman-German emperor") is used to distinguish the title from that of Roman emperor on one hand, and that of German emperor (Deutscher Kaiser) on the other. The English term "Holy Roman Emperor" is a modern shorthand for "emperor of the Holy Roman Empire" not corresponding to the historical style or title, i.e., the adjective "holy" is not intended as modifying "emperor"; the English term "Holy Roman Emperor" gained currency in the interbellum period (the 1920s to 1930s); formerly the title had also been rendered "German-Roman emperor" in English.[1] Succession[edit] Further information: Imperial election, Italienzug, and Family tree of the German monarchs Illustration of the election of Henry VII (27 November 1308) showing (left to right) the Archbishop of Cologne, Archbishop of Mainz, Archbishop of Trier, Count Palatine of the Rhine, Duke of Saxony, Margrave of Brandenburg and King of Bohemia (Codex Balduini Trevirorum, c. 1340). The elective monarchy of the kingdom of Germany goes back to the early 10th century, the election of Conrad I of Germany in 911 following the death without issue of Louis the Child, the last Carolingian ruler of Germany. Elections meant the kingship of Germany was only partially hereditary, unlike the kingship of France, although sovereignty frequently remained in a dynasty until there were no more male successors. The process of an election meant that the prime candidate had to make concessions, by which the voters were kept on his side, which was known as Wahlkapitulationen (electoral capitulation). Conrad was elected by the German dukes, and it is not known precisely when the system of seven prince-electors was established. The papal decree Venerabilem by Innocent III (1202), addressed to Berthold V, Duke of Zähringen, establishes the election procedure by (unnamed) princes of the realm, reserving for the pope the right to approve of the candidates. A letter of Pope Urban IV (1263), in the context of the disputed vote of 1256 and the subsequent interregnum, suggests that by "immemorial custom", seven princes had the right to elect the king and future emperor. The seven prince-electors are named in the Golden Bull of 1356: the archbishop of Mainz, the archbishop of Trier, the archbishop of Cologne, the king of Bohemia, the count palatine of the Rhine, the duke of Saxony and the margrave of Brandenburg. After 1438, the kings remained in the house of Habsburg and Habsburg-Lorraine, with the brief exception of Charles VII, who was a Wittelsbach. Maximilian I (emperor 1508–1519) and his successors no longer travelled to Rome to be crowned as emperor by the pope. Maximilian, therefore, named himself elected Roman emperor (Erwählter Römischer Kaiser) in 1508 with papal approval. This title was in use by all his uncrowned successors. Of his successors, only Charles V, the immediate one, received a papal coronation. The elector palatine's seat was conferred on the duke of Bavaria in 1621, but in 1648, in the wake of the Thirty Years' War, the elector palatine was restored, as the eighth elector. Electorate of Hanover was added as a ninth elector in 1692. The whole college was reshuffled in the German mediatization of 1803 with a total of ten electors, a mere three years before the dissolution of the Empire. List of emperors[edit] See also: List of German monarchs This list includes all 47 German monarchs crowned from Charlemagne until the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire (800–1806). Several rulers were crowned king of the Romans (king of Germany) but not emperor, although they styled themselves thus, among whom were: Conrad I and Henry the Fowler in the 10th century, and Conrad IV, Rudolf I, Adolf and Albert I during the interregnum of the late 13th century. Traditional historiography assumes a continuity between the Carolingian Empire and the Holy Roman Empire, while a modern convention takes the coronation of Otto I in 962 as the starting point of the Holy Roman Empire (although the term Sacrum Imperium Romanum was not in use before the 13th century). Frankish emperors[edit] Further information: List of Frankish kings § Carolingians The rulers who were crowned as Holy Roman Emperors between AD 800 and 915 were as follows: 800–888: Carolingian dynasty[edit] Main article: Carolingian dynasty Portrait Name Lifespan Reign Relationship with predecessor(s) Other title(s) Charlemagne (Charles I) 742–814 25 December 800 28 January 814 King of the Franks King of the Lombards Louis I, the Pious 778–840 11 September 813[10] 20 June 840 Son of Charles I King of the Franks King of Italy King of Aquitaine Lothair I 795–855 5 April 823 29 September 855 Son of Louis I King of Italy King of Middle Francia Louis II 825–875 29 September 855 12 August 875 Son of Lothair I King of Italy Charles II, the Bald 823–877 29 December 875 6 October 877 Son of Louis I, younger brother of Lothair I King of West Francia King of Italy Charles III, the Fat 839–888 12 February 881 13 January 888 Grandson of Louis I King of West Francia King of East Francia King of Italy 891–898: Widonid dynasty[edit] Main article: Widonids Portrait Name Lifespan Reign Relationship with predecessor(s) Other title(s) Guy I ?–894 21 February 891 12 December 894 Great-great-grandson of Charles I King of Italy Duke of Spoleto Lambert I 880–898 30 April 892 15 October 898 Son of Guy I King of Italy Duke of Spoleto 896–899: Carolingian dynasty[edit] Portrait Name Lifespan Reign Relationship with predecessor(s) Other title(s) Arnulph 850–899 22 February 896 8 December 899 Nephew of Charles III King of Italy King of East Francia 901–905: Bosonid dynasty[edit] Main article: Bosonids Portrait Name Lifespan Reign Relationship with predecessor(s) Other title(s) Louis III, the Blind 880–928 22 February 901 21 July 905 Grandson of Louis II King of Italy King of Provence 915–924: Unruoching dynasty[edit] Main article: Unruochings Portrait Name Lifespan Reign Relationship with predecessor(s) Other title(s) Berengar I 845–924 December 915 7 April 924 Grandson of Louis I King of Italy Margrave of Friuli Holy Roman Emperors[edit] There was no Holy Roman emperor between 924 and 962. While earlier Germanic and Italian monarchs had been crowned as Roman emperors, the actual Holy Roman Empire is usually considered to have begun with the crowning of the Saxon king Otto I. It was officially an elective position, though at times it ran in families, notably the four generations of the Salian dynasty in the 11th century. From the end of the Salian dynasty through the middle 15th century, the emperors drew from many different German dynasties, and it was rare for the throne to pass from father to son. That changed with the ascension of the Austrian House of Habsburg, as an unbroken line of Habsburgs held the imperial throne until the 18th century. Later a cadet branch known as the House of Habsburg-Lorraine passed it from father to son until the abolition of the Empire in 1806. Notably, the Habsburgs dispensed with the requirement that emperors be crowned by the pope before exercising their office. Starting with Ferdinand I, all successive emperors forwent the traditional coronation. 962–1024: Ottonian dynasty[edit] Main article: Ottonian dynasty Portrait Name Lifespan King Emperor Ended Relationship with predecessor(s) Other title(s) Otto I, the Great 912–973 7 August 936 2 February 962 7 May 973 King of Italy King of Germany Duke of Saxony Otto II, the Red 955–983 26 May 961 25 December 967 7 December 983 Son of Otto I King of Italy King of Germany Otto III 980–1002 25 December 983 21 May 996 23 January 1002 Son of Otto II King of Italy King of Germany Henry II[note 1] 973–1024 7 June 1002 14 February 1014 13 July 1024 Second cousin of Otto III King of Italy King of Germany Duke of Bavaria Duke of Carinthia 1027–1125: Salian dynasty[edit] Main article: Salian dynasty Portrait Name Lifespan King Emperor Ended Relationship with predecessor(s) Other title(s) Conrad II, the Elder[note 2] 990–1039 8 September 1024 26 March 1027 4 June 1039 Great-great-grandson of Otto I King of Burgundy King of Italy King of Germany Henry III, the Black 1017–1056 14 April 1028 25 December 1046 5 October 1056 Son of Conrad II King of Burgundy King of Italy King of Germany Duke of Bavaria Duke of Swabia Duke of Carinthia Margrave of Meissen Henry IV 1050–1106 17 July 1054 1 April 1084 7 August 1106 Son of Henry III King of Burgundy King of Italy King of Germany Duke of Bavaria Henry V[11] 1086–1125 6 January 1099 13 April 1111 23 May 1125 Son of Henry IV King of Italy King of Germany King of Burgundy 1133–1137: Supplinburg dynasty[edit] Portrait Name Lifespan King Emperor Ended Relationship with predecessor(s) Other title(s) Lothair II[note 3] 1075–1137 30 August 1125 4 June 1133 4 December 1137 Great-great-great-great-great-great-grandnephew of Otto I King of Italy King of Germany King of Burgundy Duke of Saxony 1155–1197: Staufen dynasty[edit] Main article: Hohenstaufen Portrait Name Lifespan King Emperor Ended Relationship with predecessor(s) Other title(s) Frederick I Barbarossa 1122–1190 4 March 1152 18 June 1155 10 June 1190 Great-grandson of Henry IV King of Germany King of Italy King of Burgundy Henry VI 1165–1197 15 August 1169 14 April 1191 28 September 1197 Son of Frederick I King of Germany King of Italy King of Burgundy Co-King of Sicily 1198–1215: Welf dynasty[edit] Main article: House of Welf Portrait Coat of arms Name Lifespan King Emperor Ended Relationship with predecessor(s) Other title(s) Otto IV 1175–1218 9 June 1198 21 October 1209 1215 Great-grandson of Lothair II King of Germany King of Italy King of Burgundy 1220–1250: Staufen dynasty[edit] Portrait Name Lifespan King Emperor Ended Relationship with predecessor(s) Other title(s) Frederick II, Stupor Mundi 1194–1250 5 December 1212 22 November 1220 13 December 1250 Son of Henry VI King of Germany King of Italy King of Sicily King of Jerusalem The interregnum of the Holy Roman Empire is taken to have lasted from the deposition of Frederick II by Pope Innocent IV (1245, alternatively from the death of Frederick 1250 or the death of Conrad IV 1254) to the election of Rudolf I of Germany (1273). Rudolf was not crowned emperor, nor were his successors Adolf and Albert.

Without that coronation, no king, despite exercising all powers, could call himself Emperor. In 1508, Pope Julius II allowed Maximilian I to use the title of Emperor without coronation in Rome, though the title was qualified as Electus Romanorum Imperator ("elected Emperor of the Romans"). Maximilian's successors adopted the same titulature, usually when they became the sole ruler of the Holy Roman Empire.[12] Maximilian's first successor Charles V was the last to be crowned Emperor.
