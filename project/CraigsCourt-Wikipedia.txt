https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig%27s_Court Craig's Court - Wikipedia Craig's Court From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Craig's Court (centre) on an 1895 Ordnance Survey map[1] The narrow entrance to Craig's Court Walkers of Whitehall when it was Walkers Wine and Ale Bar Craig's Court is a public courtyard off Whitehall in central London fronted by the grade II* listed Harrington House (c.?1692), later listed buildings, and the British Telecom Whitehall exchange.[n 1] Developer Joseph Craig had what is since the 1860s named Harrington House and other, since replaced, buildings put up in the late 1690s. This was the site of St Katherine's hermitage. Its single track-width, quite long, accessway saw the carriage of the Speaker of the House of Commons once get stuck. The court is often overlooked by tourists. The Sun Fire Office had offices at this courtyard from 1726 and army agents Cox & Company also for over 150 years. Former residents include the memoirist Teresia Constantia Phillips (1748–49) and the painter George Romney in the 1760s.

The rear of The Old Shades pub, which fronts Whitehall, fronts the court. These last two buildings stated are grade II listed (the lower, mainstream category of listed building).[10][11] Harrington House[edit] Harrington House The only remaining building from the original Craig's Court is Harrington House (street-numbered 3 & 4), built on the east side around 1692,[12] and first probably occupied by Joseph Craig. It remained in the descent of the family until 1809 and had a succession of mostly aristocratic tenants who occupied the house because it was convenient for Whitehall and their positions in the British government. It became known as Harrington House when Charles Wyndham Stanhope, the 7th Earl of Harrington, moved there in 1867 or 1868 after the building was vacated by the Sun Fire Office. It is sometimes confused with their other Harrington House in Stable Yard, St James's. Charles died in the house in 1881.[2] The telephone exchange on the north side that replaced 1 and 2 Craig's Court In 1917, the building was acquired by the army agents and bankers Cox & Company, and in 1925 was bought, with land to the north, by the Postmaster General[2][13] It was heightened in the 1950s.[12] The combined buildings are now part of the British Telecom exchange known as Q-Whitehall which contains one of the entrances to the secret government tunnels under central London which mostly date to the Second World War and Cold War.[14] Harrington House is grade II* listed with Historic England.[12] Businesses[edit] The Sun Fire Office (established 1710) is first recorded in the Court in 1726,[13] initially at number 9 before moving to Harrington House, as it would later be known, in 1759.[2] The firm moved to Charing Cross in 1867.[2] The army agents and bankers Cox & Company, founded by Richard Cox in 1758, moved to Craig's Court around 1765 as the firm grew rapidly.[15] It continued to expand in the nineteenth century as it took on the agency of more regiments, causing it to need more office space in the Court.[16] The outbreak of the First World War in 1914 caused a further increase in business and the firm acquired more office space in the Court and adjacent streets, its clerks working day and night shifts, and numbering 4,500 by 1918, but the end of the war brought a rapid decline and the sale of the business in 1923 to Lloyds Bank.[17] Former residents[edit] Physician John Wigan lived at number 8 in 1730-31.[18] Memoirist Teresia Constantia Phillips lived there in 1748 and 1749.[4] The painter George Romney had his first London home there from 1763 to 1767.[13] Architects John Henry Hakewill and his brother Edward Charles Hakewill were at number 8 in the 1840s.[19] Notes and references[edit] Footnotes[edit] ^ of which Harrington House forms a part. ^ Orthography was fluid in this century, particularly of surnames, see Edmund Halley for example Citations[edit] ^ OS London 1:1,056 – Sheet VII.73.
