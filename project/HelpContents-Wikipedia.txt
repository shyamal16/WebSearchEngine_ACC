Tip of the day User Subpages Many users like to create user subpages to store various bits of information such as welcome templates or other information. For example, if you are drafting a new page that is not ready to "go live", or proposing major changes in redrafting an existing page, a user subpage may be very useful. To create a subpage simply visit your User page and then append the name of the subpage in your browser's URL bar. For example, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:CoolDude would become http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:CoolDude/MySubpageName. When you press the ? Enter key you will be prompted to create the new subpage. If you no longer need a subpage, or wish to have it deleted, you can mark the page with {{db-owner}} or {{db|reason}}.

Tip of the day User Subpages Many users like to create user subpages to store various bits of information such as welcome templates or other information. For example, if you are drafting a new page that is not ready to "go live", or proposing major changes in redrafting an existing page, a user subpage may be very useful. To create a subpage simply visit your User page and then append the name of the subpage in your browser's URL bar. For example, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:CoolDude would become http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:CoolDude/MySubpageName. When you press the ? Enter key you will be prompted to create the new subpage. If you no longer need a subpage, or wish to have it deleted, you can mark the page with {{db-owner}} or {{db|reason}}.

Tip of the day Lead Section Size The lead section of a Wikipedia article is the section before the first heading. The table of contents, if displayed, generally appears between the lead section and the first subheading. Rule of thumb: If a topic deserves a heading or subheading, then it deserves short mention in the lead. The lead section should contain up to four paragraphs, depending on the length of the article, and should provide a preview of the main points the article will make, summarizing the primary reasons the subject matter is interesting or notable. The lead should be capable of standing alone as a concise overview of the article, should be written in a clear and accessible style, should be carefully sourced like the rest of the text, and should encourage the reader to want to read more. The following table has some general guidelines for the length of the lead section: < 15,000 characters medium size > 30,000 characters one or two paragraphs   two or three paragraphs   three or four paragraphs Prior tip – Tips library – Next tip Summary essay: WP:CREATELEAD   Read more: Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Lead section   Become a Wikipedia tipster – Tips library, by subject To add this auto-updating daily tip to your user page, use {{totd}} Additional searches Search Frequently Asked Questions Search the help desk archives v t e  Basic information on Wikipedia Help directory menu Reference desk Help desk About Wikipedia Administration FAQs Purpose Who writes Wikipedia?

Tip of the day Lead Section Size The lead section of a Wikipedia article is the section before the first heading. The table of contents, if displayed, generally appears between the lead section and the first subheading. Rule of thumb: If a topic deserves a heading or subheading, then it deserves short mention in the lead. The lead section should contain up to four paragraphs, depending on the length of the article, and should provide a preview of the main points the article will make, summarizing the primary reasons the subject matter is interesting or notable. The lead should be capable of standing alone as a concise overview of the article, should be written in a clear and accessible style, should be carefully sourced like the rest of the text, and should encourage the reader to want to read more.

Tip of the day Lead Section Size The lead section of a Wikipedia article is the section before the first heading. The table of contents, if displayed, generally appears between the lead section and the first subheading. Rule of thumb: If a topic deserves a heading or subheading, then it deserves short mention in the lead. The lead section should contain up to four paragraphs, depending on the length of the article, and should provide a preview of the main points the article will make, summarizing the primary reasons the subject matter is interesting or notable. The lead should be capable of standing alone as a concise overview of the article, should be written in a clear and accessible style, should be carefully sourced like the rest of the text, and should encourage the reader to want to read more.

Tip of the day Lead Section Size The lead section of a Wikipedia article is the section before the first heading. The table of contents, if displayed, generally appears between the lead section and the first subheading. Rule of thumb: If a topic deserves a heading or subheading, then it deserves short mention in the lead. The lead section should contain up to four paragraphs, depending on the length of the article, and should provide a preview of the main points the article will make, summarizing the primary reasons the subject matter is interesting or notable. The lead should be capable of standing alone as a concise overview of the article, should be written in a clear and accessible style, should be carefully sourced like the rest of the text, and should encourage the reader to want to read more.
