There has been no change in its boundaries since its creation. Monticello was founded in 1887, and by 1895 it was large enough to be designated the seat of San Juan County.[3] Geography[edit] Ruins in Montezuma Canyon with stones of unusual size San Juan County lies at the southeastern corner of the state of Utah. Its borders coincide with the borders of the states of Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona with Utah.[4] The convergence point of these borders, Four Corners Monument, is located at the extreme southeastern corner of the county. The county's terrain generally slopes to the west and the south, with its highest point, Mount Peale, at 12,726 feet (3,879 m) above sea level.[5] The county has a total area of 7,933 square miles (20,550 km2), of which 7,820 square miles (20,300 km2) is land and 113 square miles (290 km2) (1.4%) is water.[6] It is the largest county by area in Utah. The county's western and southern boundaries lie deep within gorges carved by the Colorado and San Juan Rivers. Tributary canyons, cutting through rock layers of the surrounding deserts, have carved the land up with chasms, cliffs and plateaus. In the center of the county are Cedar Mesa, Comb Wash, Natural Bridges and Hovenweep National Monuments. Canyonlands National Park lies mostly within the county borders. The Eastern side of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area / Lake Powell is also in the county. The Blue (Abajo) Mountains and the La Sal Mountains exceed 12,000 feet (3,700 m) in elevation. Both ranges are covered with lush forests, in stark contrast to the scenery below. The elevation change within the county is from nearly 13,000 feet (4,000 m) in the La Sal Mountains to 3,000 feet (910 m) at Lake Powell, a difference of about 10,000 feet (3,000 m). The county's towns lie primarily on a north–south axis along U.S. routes 191 and 163 from La Sal in the north to Monument Valley in the south.

As of 2017, San Juan County was the poorest county (per capita) in the state [15] and one of the poorest in the United States. Politics and Government[edit] San Juan County has supported Republican presidents since voting for Wendell Willkie in 1940. It supported a Democrat for president in 1896 (William Jennings Bryan), 1916 (Woodrow Wilson), and 1936 (Franklin D. Roosevelt). Though a Republican vote currently secures elections, the area has voted less Republican than the rest of Utah in many national elections. In 2004, for example, George W. Bush won 60.02% in San Juan County versus 71.54% in the state as a whole. In 2020, Democrat Joe Biden needed 6.13% more votes to win the county from Donald Trump, who secured 51.2% in the county as opposed to 58.13% in the state as a whole. The county is more competitive at the state level due to its high Native American population, which leans Democratic. Notably, the county voted for the Democratic candidates in the 1988 and 2000 gubernatorial elections, both of which Republican candidates won. Federally mandated commissioner districts put many Navajo voters in one district. The San Juan County Board of Commissioners has been majority white for many years. In 2016, a Federal District Court decision found voting districts violated the 1965 Voting Rights Act and the U.S. Constitution. Before the 2016 court decision, the county used an at-large voting system to elect commissioners. [16] In 2018, the first ever majority-Navajo commission was seated. Two of the three county commissioners, Willie Grayeyes and Kenneth Maryboy, are board members of Utah Diné Bikeyah, which supported the creation of Bears Ears National Monument.[17] In a 2019 special election, Proposition 10, which would have changed the structure of the county government to include five county commissioners, was blocked needing 153 more populous votes.[18] The proposition, spearheaded by Blanding Mayor Joe Lyman, was characterized by opponents as an effort to undermine the Navajo-majority county commission.[19] Mayor Joe Lyman characterized the proposition as a way to restore representation to Blanding, the county's largest city. He states, "I don't like how we arrived at the commissioners we have because it felt like a judicial appointment," and that, "the vote is very evenly split."[20] State Elected Offices Position District Name Affiliation First Elected   Senate 27 David Hinkins Republican 2008[21]   House of Representatives 73 Phil Lyman Republican 2018[22]   Board of Education 14 Mark Huntsman Nonpartisan 2014[23] Presidential election results Presidential elections results[24] Year Republican Democratic Third parties 2020 51.2% 3,535 45.1% 3,113 3.7% 256 2016 47.8% 2,645 36.9% 2,042 15.3% 847 2012 57.9% 3,074 40.3% 2,139 1.8% 94 2008 51.4% 2,638 46.9% 2,406 1.7% 86 2004 60.0% 2,971 38.5% 1,906 1.5% 73 2000 57.4% 2,721 38.7% 1,838 3.9% 185 1996 51.4% 2,139 40.2% 1,675 8.4% 351 1992 46.2% 2,004 37.8% 1,639 16.0% 692 1988 62.0% 2,377 36.7% 1,407 1.4% 53 1984 69.1% 2,598 30.5% 1,145 0.4% 15 1980 76.0% 2,774 20.9% 763 3.1% 113 1976 57.6% 1,856 36.7% 1,182 5.7% 184 1972 68.3% 1,893 24.4% 677 7.3% 203 1968 59.7% 1,393 29.1% 680 11.2% 262 1964 58.0% 1,371 42.0% 993 1960 62.7% 1,408 37.3% 837 1956 72.5% 1,119 27.5% 425 1952 67.5% 876 32.5% 421 1948 56.8% 558 42.5% 418 0.7% 7 1944 58.2% 513 41.7% 367 0.1% 1 1940 50.4% 528 49.2% 515 0.4% 4 1936 45.0% 432 54.1% 520 0.9% 9 1932 48.9% 460 48.8% 459 2.2% 21 1928 65.6% 449 33.7% 231 0.7% 5 1924 56.9% 380 34.7% 232 8.4% 56 1920 64.8% 523 32.2% 260 3.0% 24 1916 31.5% 213 66.3% 448 2.2% 15 1912 37.1% 145 37.2% 146 25.5% 100 1908 53.1% 130 44.5% 109 2.5% 6 1904 78.5% 135 20.9% 36 0.6% 1 1900 51.9% 81 46.2% 72 1.9% 3 1896 4.6% 8 95.4% 167 Communities[edit] Cities[edit] Blanding Monticello (county seat) Towns[edit] Bluff Census-designated places[edit] Aneth Halchita Halls Crossing La Sal Mexican Hat Montezuma Creek Navajo Mountain Oljato-Monument Valley Spanish Valley Tselakai Dezza White Mesa Unincorporated communities[edit] Eastland Ucolo Westwater See also[edit] Utah portal List of counties in Utah National Register of Historic Places listings in San Juan County, Utah References[edit] ^ a b "State & County QuickFacts".

As of 2017, San Juan County was the poorest county (per capita) in the state [15] and one of the poorest in the United States. Politics and Government[edit] San Juan County has supported Republican presidents since voting for Wendell Willkie in 1940. It supported a Democrat for president in 1896 (William Jennings Bryan), 1916 (Woodrow Wilson), and 1936 (Franklin D. Roosevelt). Though a Republican vote currently secures elections, the area has voted less Republican than the rest of Utah in many national elections. In 2004, for example, George W. Bush won 60.02% in San Juan County versus 71.54% in the state as a whole. In 2020, Democrat Joe Biden needed 6.13% more votes to win the county from Donald Trump, who secured 51.2% in the county as opposed to 58.13% in the state as a whole. The county is more competitive at the state level due to its high Native American population, which leans Democratic. Notably, the county voted for the Democratic candidates in the 1988 and 2000 gubernatorial elections, both of which Republican candidates won. Federally mandated commissioner districts put many Navajo voters in one district. The San Juan County Board of Commissioners has been majority white for many years. In 2016, a Federal District Court decision found voting districts violated the 1965 Voting Rights Act and the U.S. Constitution. Before the 2016 court decision, the county used an at-large voting system to elect commissioners. [16] In 2018, the first ever majority-Navajo commission was seated. Two of the three county commissioners, Willie Grayeyes and Kenneth Maryboy, are board members of Utah Diné Bikeyah, which supported the creation of Bears Ears National Monument.[17] In a 2019 special election, Proposition 10, which would have changed the structure of the county government to include five county commissioners, was blocked needing 153 more populous votes.[18] The proposition, spearheaded by Blanding Mayor Joe Lyman, was characterized by opponents as an effort to undermine the Navajo-majority county commission.[19] Mayor Joe Lyman characterized the proposition as a way to restore representation to Blanding, the county's largest city. He states, "I don't like how we arrived at the commissioners we have because it felt like a judicial appointment," and that, "the vote is very evenly split."[20] State Elected Offices Position District Name Affiliation First Elected   Senate 27 David Hinkins Republican 2008[21]   House of Representatives 73 Phil Lyman Republican 2018[22]   Board of Education 14 Mark Huntsman Nonpartisan 2014[23] Presidential election results Presidential elections results[24] Year Republican Democratic Third parties 2020 51.2% 3,535 45.1% 3,113 3.7% 256 2016 47.8% 2,645 36.9% 2,042 15.3% 847 2012 57.9% 3,074 40.3% 2,139 1.8% 94 2008 51.4% 2,638 46.9% 2,406 1.7% 86 2004 60.0% 2,971 38.5% 1,906 1.5% 73 2000 57.4% 2,721 38.7% 1,838 3.9% 185 1996 51.4% 2,139 40.2% 1,675 8.4% 351 1992 46.2% 2,004 37.8% 1,639 16.0% 692 1988 62.0% 2,377 36.7% 1,407 1.4% 53 1984 69.1% 2,598 30.5% 1,145 0.4% 15 1980 76.0% 2,774 20.9% 763 3.1% 113 1976 57.6% 1,856 36.7% 1,182 5.7% 184 1972 68.3% 1,893 24.4% 677 7.3% 203 1968 59.7% 1,393 29.1% 680 11.2% 262 1964 58.0% 1,371 42.0% 993 1960 62.7% 1,408 37.3% 837 1956 72.5% 1,119 27.5% 425 1952 67.5% 876 32.5% 421 1948 56.8% 558 42.5% 418 0.7% 7 1944 58.2% 513 41.7% 367 0.1% 1 1940 50.4% 528 49.2% 515 0.4% 4 1936 45.0% 432 54.1% 520 0.9% 9 1932 48.9% 460 48.8% 459 2.2% 21 1928 65.6% 449 33.7% 231 0.7% 5 1924 56.9% 380 34.7% 232 8.4% 56 1920 64.8% 523 32.2% 260 3.0% 24 1916 31.5% 213 66.3% 448 2.2% 15 1912 37.1% 145 37.2% 146 25.5% 100 1908 53.1% 130 44.5% 109 2.5% 6 1904 78.5% 135 20.9% 36 0.6% 1 1900 51.9% 81 46.2% 72 1.9% 3 1896 4.6% 8 95.4% 167 Communities[edit] Cities[edit] Blanding Monticello (county seat) Towns[edit] Bluff Census-designated places[edit] Aneth Halchita Halls Crossing La Sal Mexican Hat Montezuma Creek Navajo Mountain Oljato-Monument Valley Spanish Valley Tselakai Dezza White Mesa Unincorporated communities[edit] Eastland Ucolo Westwater See also[edit] Utah portal List of counties in Utah National Register of Historic Places listings in San Juan County, Utah References[edit] ^ a b "State & County QuickFacts".

As of the 2010 United States Census, the population was 14,746.[1] Its county seat is Monticello,[2] while its most populous city is Blanding. The county was named by the Utah State Legislature for the San Juan River, itself named by Spanish explorers (in honor of Saint John). San Juan County borders Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico at the Four Corners.

There has been no change in its boundaries since its creation. Monticello was founded in 1887, and by 1895 it was large enough to be designated the seat of San Juan County.[3] Geography[edit] Ruins in Montezuma Canyon with stones of unusual size San Juan County lies at the southeastern corner of the state of Utah. Its borders coincide with the borders of the states of Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona with Utah.[4] The convergence point of these borders, Four Corners Monument, is located at the extreme southeastern corner of the county. The county's terrain generally slopes to the west and the south, with its highest point, Mount Peale, at 12,726 feet (3,879 m) above sea level.[5] The county has a total area of 7,933 square miles (20,550 km2), of which 7,820 square miles (20,300 km2) is land and 113 square miles (290 km2) (1.4%) is water.[6] It is the largest county by area in Utah. The county's western and southern boundaries lie deep within gorges carved by the Colorado and San Juan Rivers. Tributary canyons, cutting through rock layers of the surrounding deserts, have carved the land up with chasms, cliffs and plateaus. In the center of the county are Cedar Mesa, Comb Wash, Natural Bridges and Hovenweep National Monuments. Canyonlands National Park lies mostly within the county borders. The Eastern side of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area / Lake Powell is also in the county. The Blue (Abajo) Mountains and the La Sal Mountains exceed 12,000 feet (3,700 m) in elevation. Both ranges are covered with lush forests, in stark contrast to the scenery below. The elevation change within the county is from nearly 13,000 feet (4,000 m) in the La Sal Mountains to 3,000 feet (910 m) at Lake Powell, a difference of about 10,000 feet (3,000 m). The county's towns lie primarily on a north–south axis along U.S. routes 191 and 163 from La Sal in the north to Monument Valley in the south.

The county is more competitive at the state level due to its high Native American population, which leans Democratic. Notably, the county voted for the Democratic candidates in the 1988 and 2000 gubernatorial elections, both of which Republican candidates won. Federally mandated commissioner districts put many Navajo voters in one district. The San Juan County Board of Commissioners has been majority white for many years. In 2016, a Federal District Court decision found voting districts violated the 1965 Voting Rights Act and the U.S. Constitution. Before the 2016 court decision, the county used an at-large voting system to elect commissioners. [16] In 2018, the first ever majority-Navajo commission was seated. Two of the three county commissioners, Willie Grayeyes and Kenneth Maryboy, are board members of Utah Diné Bikeyah, which supported the creation of Bears Ears National Monument.[17] In a 2019 special election, Proposition 10, which would have changed the structure of the county government to include five county commissioners, was blocked needing 153 more populous votes.[18] The proposition, spearheaded by Blanding Mayor Joe Lyman, was characterized by opponents as an effort to undermine the Navajo-majority county commission.[19] Mayor Joe Lyman characterized the proposition as a way to restore representation to Blanding, the county's largest city. He states, "I don't like how we arrived at the commissioners we have because it felt like a judicial appointment," and that, "the vote is very evenly split."[20] State Elected Offices Position District Name Affiliation First Elected   Senate 27 David Hinkins Republican 2008[21]   House of Representatives 73 Phil Lyman Republican 2018[22]   Board of Education 14 Mark Huntsman Nonpartisan 2014[23] Presidential election results Presidential elections results[24] Year Republican Democratic Third parties 2020 51.2% 3,535 45.1% 3,113 3.7% 256 2016 47.8% 2,645 36.9% 2,042 15.3% 847 2012 57.9% 3,074 40.3% 2,139 1.8% 94 2008 51.4% 2,638 46.9% 2,406 1.7% 86 2004 60.0% 2,971 38.5% 1,906 1.5% 73 2000 57.4% 2,721 38.7% 1,838 3.9% 185 1996 51.4% 2,139 40.2% 1,675 8.4% 351 1992 46.2% 2,004 37.8% 1,639 16.0% 692 1988 62.0% 2,377 36.7% 1,407 1.4% 53 1984 69.1% 2,598 30.5% 1,145 0.4% 15 1980 76.0% 2,774 20.9% 763 3.1% 113 1976 57.6% 1,856 36.7% 1,182 5.7% 184 1972 68.3% 1,893 24.4% 677 7.3% 203 1968 59.7% 1,393 29.1% 680 11.2% 262 1964 58.0% 1,371 42.0% 993 1960 62.7% 1,408 37.3% 837 1956 72.5% 1,119 27.5% 425 1952 67.5% 876 32.5% 421 1948 56.8% 558 42.5% 418 0.7% 7 1944 58.2% 513 41.7% 367 0.1% 1 1940 50.4% 528 49.2% 515 0.4% 4 1936 45.0% 432 54.1% 520 0.9% 9 1932 48.9% 460 48.8% 459 2.2% 21 1928 65.6% 449 33.7% 231 0.7% 5 1924 56.9% 380 34.7% 232 8.4% 56 1920 64.8% 523 32.2% 260 3.0% 24 1916 31.5% 213 66.3% 448 2.2% 15 1912 37.1% 145 37.2% 146 25.5% 100 1908 53.1% 130 44.5% 109 2.5% 6 1904 78.5% 135 20.9% 36 0.6% 1 1900 51.9% 81 46.2% 72 1.9% 3 1896 4.6% 8 95.4% 167 Communities[edit] Cities[edit] Blanding Monticello (county seat) Towns[edit] Bluff Census-designated places[edit] Aneth Halchita Halls Crossing La Sal Mexican Hat Montezuma Creek Navajo Mountain Oljato-Monument Valley Spanish Valley Tselakai Dezza White Mesa Unincorporated communities[edit] Eastland Ucolo Westwater See also[edit] Utah portal List of counties in Utah National Register of Historic Places listings in San Juan County, Utah References[edit] ^ a b "State & County QuickFacts".
