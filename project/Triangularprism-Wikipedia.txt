A right triangular prism has rectangular sides, otherwise it is oblique. A uniform triangular prism is a right triangular prism with equilateral bases, and square sides. Equivalently, it is a polyhedron of which two faces are parallel, while the surface normals of the other three are in the same plane (which is not necessarily parallel to the base planes). These three faces are parallelograms. All cross-sections parallel to the base faces are the same triangle.

It can be seen as a truncated trigonal hosohedron, represented by Schläfli symbol t{2,3}. Alternately it can be seen as the Cartesian product of a triangle and a line segment, and represented by the product, The dual of a triangular prism is a triangular bipyramid. The symmetry group of a right 3-sided prism with triangular base is D3h of order 12. The rotation group is D3 of order 6. The symmetry group does not contain inversion. Volume[edit] The volume of any prism is the product of the area of the base and the distance between the two bases. In this case the base is a triangle so we simply need to compute the area of the triangle and multiply this by the length of the prism: V = b h l 2 , {\displaystyle V={\frac {bhl}{2}},} where b is the length of one side of the triangle, h is the length of an altitude drawn to that side, and l is the distance between the triangular faces. Truncated triangular prism[edit] A truncated right triangular prism has one triangular face truncated (planed) at an oblique angle.[1] The volume of a truncated triangular prism with base area A and the three heights h1, h2, and h3 is determined by[2] V = A ( h 1 + h 2 + h 3 ) 3 . {\displaystyle V={\frac {A(h_{1}+h_{2}+h_{3})}{3}}.} Facetings[edit] There are two full D3h symmetry facetings of a triangular prism, both with 6 isosceles triangle faces, one keeping the original top and bottom triangles, and one the original squares. Two lower C3v symmetry facetings have one base triangle, 3 lateral crossed square faces, and 3 isosceles triangle lateral faces.

Each half is a topological triangular prism.

Honeycombs[edit] There are 9 uniform honeycombs that include triangular prism cells: Gyroelongated alternated cubic honeycomb, elongated alternated cubic honeycomb, gyrated triangular prismatic honeycomb, snub square prismatic honeycomb, triangular prismatic honeycomb, triangular-hexagonal prismatic honeycomb, truncated hexagonal prismatic honeycomb, rhombitriangular-hexagonal prismatic honeycomb, snub triangular-hexagonal prismatic honeycomb, elongated triangular prismatic honeycomb Related polytopes[edit] The triangular prism is first in a dimensional series of semiregular polytopes. Each progressive uniform polytope is constructed vertex figure of the previous polytope. Thorold Gosset identified this series in 1900 as containing all regular polytope facets, containing all simplexes and orthoplexes (equilateral triangles and squares in the case of the triangular prism). In Coxeter's notation the triangular prism is given the symbol ?121. k21 figures in n dimensional Space Finite Euclidean Hyperbolic En 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Coxeter group E3=A2A1 E4=A4 E5=D5 E6 E7 E8 E9 = E ~ 8 {\displaystyle {\tilde {E}}_{8}} = E8+ E10 = T ¯ 8 {\displaystyle {\bar {T}}_{8}} = E8++ Coxeter diagram Symmetry [3?1,2,1] [30,2,1] [31,2,1] [32,2,1] [33,2,1] [34,2,1] [35,2,1] [36,2,1] Order 12 120 1,920 51,840 2,903,040 696,729,600 ?
