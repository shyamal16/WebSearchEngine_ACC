High resolution tomography shows that this magma body has a diameter of ~200 km, a depth of 14-20 km, with a total volume of ~500,000 km3,[2][3] making it the largest known active magma body on Earth.[1][4][5] Thickness estimates for the APMB are varied, with some as low as 1 km,[4][6] others around 10-20 km,[7] and some extending as far down as the Moho[8]. The APMB is primarily composed of 7-10 wt% water andesitic melts and the upper portion may contain more dacitic melts[9][10] with partial melt percentages ranging from 10-40%.[2] Measurements indicate that the region around the Uturuncu volcano in Bolivia is uplifting at a rate of ~10 mm/year, surrounded by a large region of subsidence.[5] This movement is likely a result of the APMB interacting with the surrounding rock and causing deformation.[5][10] Recent research demonstrates that this uplift rate may fluctuate over months or years and that it has decreased over the past decade.[11] Various techniques, such as seismic, gravity, and electromagnetic measurements have been used to image the low-velocity zone in the mid to upper crust known as the APMB.[9] Contents 1 Composition 2 Deformation 3 Imaging Techniques 3.1 Seismic 3.2 Gravity 3.3 Electromagnetic 4 References Composition[edit] The APMB is likely compositionally zoned with the lower 18-30 km containing andesitic melts and the upper 9-18 km containing dacitic melts.[9] Estimates for the percentage of andesitic melt vary from 8 vol% on the low end and up to 30 vol% on the high end.[10] These andesitic melts also have a high water content (~7-10 wt.% water[10]) indicated by the high electrical conductivity measured in the APMB.[12] Measurements for the partial melt percentage in the APMB also vary, with seismic imaging indicating that it is anywhere from 10-40% partial melt.[2] For a magma body with ~20% partial melt, the viscosity is estimated to be <1016 Pa s.[13] Deformation[edit] The Altiplano-Puna region around the Uturuncu volcano is experiencing a type of deformation termed 'sombrero uplift,' which means that there is a central zone of uplift surrounded by a region of subsidence.[5] One potential explanation for this sombrero uplift pattern is the formation and growth of a large diapir arising from the APMB.[5] Lower density magma than the surrounding rocks is produced during partial melting in the APMB, causing a plume of buoyant magma to rise from the center of the magma body.[5] This causes material to be removed from the APMB to feed the growing diapir, resulting in a region of subsidence surrounding the uplift zone[5]. Deformation model showing the extent of the sombrero uplift pattern as well as one explanation for what is occurring beneath the surface.[10] Data collected between 1992 and 2010 demonstrates that the region is uplifting at a rate of ~10 mm/year and subsiding at a slower rate (only a few mm/year).[5][11] More recent InSAR data, collected between September 2014 and December 2017, shows that the uplift rate over this time period has decreased to 3-5 mm/year and may experience short-term velocity reversals.[11] Additionally, there is evidence that the uplift and subsidence rates have balanced out over the past 16,000 years to create no net deformation.[9] These aspects of the uplift and subsidence cannot be easily explained by the diapir model, so other possible mechanisms for driving the deformation are being investigated.[11] One such mechanism that might explain the deformation is the movement of volatiles in a column connected to the APMB.[10] Movement like this may explain the surface deformation rate that varies on monthly or yearly scales and appears to have resulted in no net deformation over longer time periods.[10][9] Imaging Techniques[edit] Seismic[edit] Between 1996 and 1997, several broadband seismic stations were deployed over the Altiplano-Puna Volcanic Complex (APVC) in order to characterize the magmatic structures beneath the surface.[4] These stations found a low velocity region approximately 10-20 km beneath the surface that was interpreted to be a sill-like magma body associated with the APVC.[4] Seismic studies and modeling continues to take place in this area, further constraining the extent and characteristics of this magma body.[2][14][6][15] Gravity[edit] A 3D density model of the Central Andes was developed based on modeling of Bouguer anomalies and it provided a more detailed view of the region's lithospheric structure and an estimation of the amount of partial melt present in the APMB (~9%).[16] Continued investigation of Bouguer anomaly data led to the discovery of an column-like, low density structure extending from the top of the APMB with a diameter of approximately 15 km.[3] Electromagnetic[edit] Electromagnetic methods have also been used to investigate structures in the Andes as well as determine characteristics of the APMB. Magnetotelluric stations were deployed across the Central Andes and resolved a highly conductive region beneath the Altiplano-Puna plateau, which appeared to coincide with the low velocity zone associated with the APMB.[4][17] Further magnetotelluric studies showed that the region has low electrical resistivities of <3 ?m.[13] Resistivity values in this range are interpreted to only occur with magma that contains a minimum of 15% andesitic melt.[13] Additionally, these resistivity values indicate that the melt has a water content up to 10 wt.% H2O, which makes up approximately 10% of the APMB.[12] References[edit] ^ a b Perkins, Jonathan P.; Ward, Kevin M.; de Silva, Shanaka L.; Zandt, George; Beck, Susan L.; Finnegan, Noah J.

Deformation model showing the extent of the sombrero uplift pattern as well as one explanation for what is occurring beneath the surface.[10] Data collected between 1992 and 2010 demonstrates that the region is uplifting at a rate of ~10 mm/year and subsiding at a slower rate (only a few mm/year).[5][11] More recent InSAR data, collected between September 2014 and December 2017, shows that the uplift rate over this time period has decreased to 3-5 mm/year and may experience short-term velocity reversals.[11] Additionally, there is evidence that the uplift and subsidence rates have balanced out over the past 16,000 years to create no net deformation.[9] These aspects of the uplift and subsidence cannot be easily explained by the diapir model, so other possible mechanisms for driving the deformation are being investigated.[11] One such mechanism that might explain the deformation is the movement of volatiles in a column connected to the APMB.[10] Movement like this may explain the surface deformation rate that varies on monthly or yearly scales and appears to have resulted in no net deformation over longer time periods.[10][9] Imaging Techniques[edit] Seismic[edit] Between 1996 and 1997, several broadband seismic stations were deployed over the Altiplano-Puna Volcanic Complex (APVC) in order to characterize the magmatic structures beneath the surface.[4] These stations found a low velocity region approximately 10-20 km beneath the surface that was interpreted to be a sill-like magma body associated with the APVC.[4] Seismic studies and modeling continues to take place in this area, further constraining the extent and characteristics of this magma body.[2][14][6][15] Gravity[edit] A 3D density model of the Central Andes was developed based on modeling of Bouguer anomalies and it provided a more detailed view of the region's lithospheric structure and an estimation of the amount of partial melt present in the APMB (~9%).[16] Continued investigation of Bouguer anomaly data led to the discovery of an column-like, low density structure extending from the top of the APMB with a diameter of approximately 15 km.[3] Electromagnetic[edit] Electromagnetic methods have also been used to investigate structures in the Andes as well as determine characteristics of the APMB. Magnetotelluric stations were deployed across the Central Andes and resolved a highly conductive region beneath the Altiplano-Puna plateau, which appeared to coincide with the low velocity zone associated with the APMB.[4][17] Further magnetotelluric studies showed that the region has low electrical resistivities of <3 ?m.[13] Resistivity values in this range are interpreted to only occur with magma that contains a minimum of 15% andesitic melt.[13] Additionally, these resistivity values indicate that the melt has a water content up to 10 wt.% H2O, which makes up approximately 10% of the APMB.[12] References[edit] ^ a b Perkins, Jonathan P.; Ward, Kevin M.; de Silva, Shanaka L.; Zandt, George; Beck, Susan L.; Finnegan, Noah J.

Deformation model showing the extent of the sombrero uplift pattern as well as one explanation for what is occurring beneath the surface.[10] Data collected between 1992 and 2010 demonstrates that the region is uplifting at a rate of ~10 mm/year and subsiding at a slower rate (only a few mm/year).[5][11] More recent InSAR data, collected between September 2014 and December 2017, shows that the uplift rate over this time period has decreased to 3-5 mm/year and may experience short-term velocity reversals.[11] Additionally, there is evidence that the uplift and subsidence rates have balanced out over the past 16,000 years to create no net deformation.[9] These aspects of the uplift and subsidence cannot be easily explained by the diapir model, so other possible mechanisms for driving the deformation are being investigated.[11] One such mechanism that might explain the deformation is the movement of volatiles in a column connected to the APMB.[10] Movement like this may explain the surface deformation rate that varies on monthly or yearly scales and appears to have resulted in no net deformation over longer time periods.[10][9] Imaging Techniques[edit] Seismic[edit] Between 1996 and 1997, several broadband seismic stations were deployed over the Altiplano-Puna Volcanic Complex (APVC) in order to characterize the magmatic structures beneath the surface.[4] These stations found a low velocity region approximately 10-20 km beneath the surface that was interpreted to be a sill-like magma body associated with the APVC.[4] Seismic studies and modeling continues to take place in this area, further constraining the extent and characteristics of this magma body.[2][14][6][15] Gravity[edit] A 3D density model of the Central Andes was developed based on modeling of Bouguer anomalies and it provided a more detailed view of the region's lithospheric structure and an estimation of the amount of partial melt present in the APMB (~9%).[16] Continued investigation of Bouguer anomaly data led to the discovery of an column-like, low density structure extending from the top of the APMB with a diameter of approximately 15 km.[3] Electromagnetic[edit] Electromagnetic methods have also been used to investigate structures in the Andes as well as determine characteristics of the APMB. Magnetotelluric stations were deployed across the Central Andes and resolved a highly conductive region beneath the Altiplano-Puna plateau, which appeared to coincide with the low velocity zone associated with the APMB.[4][17] Further magnetotelluric studies showed that the region has low electrical resistivities of <3 ?m.[13] Resistivity values in this range are interpreted to only occur with magma that contains a minimum of 15% andesitic melt.[13] Additionally, these resistivity values indicate that the melt has a water content up to 10 wt.% H2O, which makes up approximately 10% of the APMB.[12] References[edit] ^ a b Perkins, Jonathan P.; Ward, Kevin M.; de Silva, Shanaka L.; Zandt, George; Beck, Susan L.; Finnegan, Noah J.

Deformation model showing the extent of the sombrero uplift pattern as well as one explanation for what is occurring beneath the surface.[10] Data collected between 1992 and 2010 demonstrates that the region is uplifting at a rate of ~10 mm/year and subsiding at a slower rate (only a few mm/year).[5][11] More recent InSAR data, collected between September 2014 and December 2017, shows that the uplift rate over this time period has decreased to 3-5 mm/year and may experience short-term velocity reversals.[11] Additionally, there is evidence that the uplift and subsidence rates have balanced out over the past 16,000 years to create no net deformation.[9] These aspects of the uplift and subsidence cannot be easily explained by the diapir model, so other possible mechanisms for driving the deformation are being investigated.[11] One such mechanism that might explain the deformation is the movement of volatiles in a column connected to the APMB.[10] Movement like this may explain the surface deformation rate that varies on monthly or yearly scales and appears to have resulted in no net deformation over longer time periods.[10][9] Imaging Techniques[edit] Seismic[edit] Between 1996 and 1997, several broadband seismic stations were deployed over the Altiplano-Puna Volcanic Complex (APVC) in order to characterize the magmatic structures beneath the surface.[4] These stations found a low velocity region approximately 10-20 km beneath the surface that was interpreted to be a sill-like magma body associated with the APVC.[4] Seismic studies and modeling continues to take place in this area, further constraining the extent and characteristics of this magma body.[2][14][6][15] Gravity[edit] A 3D density model of the Central Andes was developed based on modeling of Bouguer anomalies and it provided a more detailed view of the region's lithospheric structure and an estimation of the amount of partial melt present in the APMB (~9%).[16] Continued investigation of Bouguer anomaly data led to the discovery of an column-like, low density structure extending from the top of the APMB with a diameter of approximately 15 km.[3] Electromagnetic[edit] Electromagnetic methods have also been used to investigate structures in the Andes as well as determine characteristics of the APMB. Magnetotelluric stations were deployed across the Central Andes and resolved a highly conductive region beneath the Altiplano-Puna plateau, which appeared to coincide with the low velocity zone associated with the APMB.[4][17] Further magnetotelluric studies showed that the region has low electrical resistivities of <3 ?m.[13] Resistivity values in this range are interpreted to only occur with magma that contains a minimum of 15% andesitic melt.[13] Additionally, these resistivity values indicate that the melt has a water content up to 10 wt.% H2O, which makes up approximately 10% of the APMB.[12] References[edit] ^ a b Perkins, Jonathan P.; Ward, Kevin M.; de Silva, Shanaka L.; Zandt, George; Beck, Susan L.; Finnegan, Noah J.

Deformation model showing the extent of the sombrero uplift pattern as well as one explanation for what is occurring beneath the surface.[10] Data collected between 1992 and 2010 demonstrates that the region is uplifting at a rate of ~10 mm/year and subsiding at a slower rate (only a few mm/year).[5][11] More recent InSAR data, collected between September 2014 and December 2017, shows that the uplift rate over this time period has decreased to 3-5 mm/year and may experience short-term velocity reversals.[11] Additionally, there is evidence that the uplift and subsidence rates have balanced out over the past 16,000 years to create no net deformation.[9] These aspects of the uplift and subsidence cannot be easily explained by the diapir model, so other possible mechanisms for driving the deformation are being investigated.[11] One such mechanism that might explain the deformation is the movement of volatiles in a column connected to the APMB.[10] Movement like this may explain the surface deformation rate that varies on monthly or yearly scales and appears to have resulted in no net deformation over longer time periods.[10][9] Imaging Techniques[edit] Seismic[edit] Between 1996 and 1997, several broadband seismic stations were deployed over the Altiplano-Puna Volcanic Complex (APVC) in order to characterize the magmatic structures beneath the surface.[4] These stations found a low velocity region approximately 10-20 km beneath the surface that was interpreted to be a sill-like magma body associated with the APVC.[4] Seismic studies and modeling continues to take place in this area, further constraining the extent and characteristics of this magma body.[2][14][6][15] Gravity[edit] A 3D density model of the Central Andes was developed based on modeling of Bouguer anomalies and it provided a more detailed view of the region's lithospheric structure and an estimation of the amount of partial melt present in the APMB (~9%).[16] Continued investigation of Bouguer anomaly data led to the discovery of an column-like, low density structure extending from the top of the APMB with a diameter of approximately 15 km.[3] Electromagnetic[edit] Electromagnetic methods have also been used to investigate structures in the Andes as well as determine characteristics of the APMB. Magnetotelluric stations were deployed across the Central Andes and resolved a highly conductive region beneath the Altiplano-Puna plateau, which appeared to coincide with the low velocity zone associated with the APMB.[4][17] Further magnetotelluric studies showed that the region has low electrical resistivities of <3 ?m.[13] Resistivity values in this range are interpreted to only occur with magma that contains a minimum of 15% andesitic melt.[13] Additionally, these resistivity values indicate that the melt has a water content up to 10 wt.% H2O, which makes up approximately 10% of the APMB.[12] References[edit] ^ a b Perkins, Jonathan P.; Ward, Kevin M.; de Silva, Shanaka L.; Zandt, George; Beck, Susan L.; Finnegan, Noah J.

High resolution tomography shows that this magma body has a diameter of ~200 km, a depth of 14-20 km, with a total volume of ~500,000 km3,[2][3] making it the largest known active magma body on Earth.[1][4][5] Thickness estimates for the APMB are varied, with some as low as 1 km,[4][6] others around 10-20 km,[7] and some extending as far down as the Moho[8].
