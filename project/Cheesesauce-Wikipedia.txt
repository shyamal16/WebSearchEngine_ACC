Cheez Whiz is commonly used for Philadelphia cheesesteak.[13] Varieties An open jar of Cheez Whiz Chili con queso with tortilla chips Mornay sauce Culinary uses[edit] Fettuccine Alfredo, prepared with

itself[14] Industrial products[edit] Cheese sauce is a mass-produced product in the United States and other countries, such as China and Switzerland.[26][27] In the U.S., commercial preparations are available to consumers in grocery stores and are used in family-style, casual and fast food restaurants.[1][28][29] Mass-produced cheese sauce is typically prepared aseptically and then packaged in sterile cans, bottles and bag-in-box containers.[30][31] Some varieties are sold in aerosol cans.[32] Commercial cheese sauces may be prepared using natural cheese, processed cheese, or both.[a] Various food additives and preservatives may be used in commercial preparations to create a uniform product that is consistent and stabilized in texture, consistency, color and flavor, to enhance flavor, and to ensure freshness.[15][34] Some additives and preservatives used may include carrageenan, citric acid, monosodium glutamate, sodium citrate, sorbic acid, and xanthan gum, among others.[15] The industrial preparation and processing of liquid cheese sauces typically involve the shredding of bulk cheese products which is then placed en masse into a large processing container along with various dry ingredients and emulsifying salts.[15][35] The mixture is agitated to create a slurry, and is then aseptically treated using various machines to heat and sterilize the product and make it pourable, after which sterile bottles, jars or cans are filled with the product.[15] Such aseptically processed cheese sauces are typically shelf-stable, requiring no refrigeration until opened.[15] Bag-in-box cheese sauces are typically used in retail environments and involve the use of connecting a bag of aseptically-treated cheese sauce to a vessel that heats it and keeps it warm at a food-safe temperature.[31] A pump dispenser is used that delivers the sauce to various items, such as tortilla chips and sandwiches.[31][34] Cheese sauces are also mass-produced in a powdered dry mix form.[36][37] These are produced as an instant food and purveyed to consumers in sauce mix packets and jars.[38] Dry mix packets are also provided in some dry macaroni and cheese products.[39][40] Commercial frozen cheese sauce is used as an ingredient in prepared frozen meals and prepared frozen vegetables.[41][42] In some instances, particularly when a sauce has a high-fat content, the product may require emulsification to keep the product uniform and prevent it from separating.[41] Factors in frozen sauces such as their overall fat content and the size of particulates in them plays a role in how various frozen cheese sauces are formulated, cooked, treated and processed.[41] Additionally, commercial cheese sauce formulations have been used as an ingredient in processed canned vegetables in the United States.[43][44] Circa the later 2000s, the Campbell Soup Company began to modify its canned cheese sauce formulas based upon the company's perceived consumer preferences in various geographic regions in the United States.[45] The company concluded that the sauce was not considered hot enough (pungent) for average consumers in the American Southwest and West while being too hot for consumers in the Eastern United States.[45] At the time, to better serve its customer base, Campbell's began manufacturing a hotter product in their California and Texas plants compared to their other plants.[45] In July 2018, Kraft Heinz issued a voluntary nationwide product recall in the United states of around 100,000 jars of cheese dip,[46][47] due to a potential for the growth of Clostridium botulinum because of ingredient separation.[47] It was only distributed in the United States, and consumers were advised not to eat it, even if it lacked signs of spoilage.[47][48]
