All the shit she was telling you, you get to seeing that shit when you hit about 15", saying that when he approached that age he began utilizing her teachings throughout his life to be more independent.[10] His grandmother often did not allow Dolph to have friends visit their home but on occasion let homeless friends stay with the family.[10] As a teenager, Dolph attended Hamilton High School.[11] Career 2008–2017: Early success and shootings In 2008, Young Dolph released his first mixtape Paper Route Campaign.[12] Two years later, he formally established his label Paper Route Empire in 2010, an independent record label not affiliated with a major record label, and subsequently released Welcome 2 Dolph World that same year.[12][9] With the release of mixtapes High Class Street Music and High Class Street Music Episode 2 in 2011, Dolph began to develop his own rap flow, shifting away from a style similar to Memphis rappers Three 6 Mafia and 8Ball & MJG instead to a personal style described as "vociferous" with a "magnetic delivery and uniquely deep voice".[13][14] With Dolph's increasing popularity, Memphis rapper Yo Gotti extended him a record deal on Gotti's Collective Music Group label affiliated with Epic Records in August 2014, but Dolph declined, preferring to remain independent.[14][13] In 2016, Young Dolph was featured on O.T. Genasis's hit double platinum single "Cut It". Later that year, he released his debut album King of Memphis under his independent Paper Route Empire label, which peaked at 49th on the Billboard 200.[13] Other Memphis rappers including Yo Gotti and Gotti-affiliated Blac Youngsta took offense to the album title, with Youngsta leading an armed group attempting to find Young Dolph in Memphis and releasing a diss track, "SHAKE SUM (Young Dolph Diss)" in response.[14] The following year, Dolph released a diss track against Yo Gotti entitled "Play Wit Yo' Bitch" prompting Gotti to release a response song. Two weeks later, in February 2017, Dolph released a music video for "Play Wit Yo' Bitch" and the next day, Young's vehicle was the target of gunfire in Charlotte, North Carolina, while in town for a performance at the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association tournament.[9][14][15] His car was reportedly shot over 100 times but was outfitted with bulletproof panels, and no one was hurt.[9][15] Following the shooting, Blac Youngsta and two other men were arrested, but the charges were later dropped due to insufficient evidence.[16] Young Dolph used the publicity from the shooting to promote his second studio album Bulletproof.[17] In September that same year, Dolph was shot multiple times, and in February 2018, he released the extended play Niggas Get Shot Everyday, referencing this prior incident.[9] 2017–2020: Charting singles and first top 10 album Young Dolph performing in 2017 In 2017, Young Dolph signed his cousin-by-marriage and fellow Memphis rapper Key Glock to his Paper Route Empire label after meeting at family gatherings.[12] In 2018, Young Dolph and Key Glock released the single "Major", which peaked at number 47 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.[18] That same year, Dolph said that he had been offered a $22 million label deal which he turned down. Preferring to stay on his own independent label, Dolph stated, "It really was a good deal, a super good deal to tell you the truth. But it's just, I see something else".[16] Dolph later revealed that he signed a record deal with Empire Distribution, and his September 2018 album Role Model was released under the label Paper Route EMPIRE, a joint venture between Paper Route Empire and Empire distribution.[19] In July 2019, Dolph again collaborated with Key Glock, this time releasing his first collaborative album entitled Dum and Dummer, imitating the title of the Farrelly brothers' film Dumb and Dumber.[20][12] The album peaked at number eight on the Billboard 200, earning each of the artists their first top 10 album.[21] The album was produced by BandPlay, who used a variety of styles of beats in the album's tracks.[22] Reviewers for the album noted Dolph's greater "songwriting range", with "depths of self-loathing and despair" that were complemented by the younger Key Glock's "celebrations of himself".[22] 2020–2021: Retirement rumors and top 10 solo album In early 2020, rumors emerged that Dolph was considering his retirement from music in order to spend more time with his children and was seen more frequently in Memphis.[23][24] On his Instagram, Dolph wrote, "Highly considering quitting the music business because I really wanna be with my kids 24/7".[23] During the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, Dolph released the single "Sunshine" and released edited album covers of previous releases on streaming services to feature individuals wearing surgical masks to highlight and address the global situation.[24] In an interview with GQ in May 2020, he was asked about his recent release of music, with Dolph replying "Man, my little boy wanted to hear some new music. ... I'll keep it real: I ain't really been on my rapper shit, I been on my industry shit, the big bro shit. I got a lot of artists, and I been dropping all my artists' projects, and they going up. ... So I'm like, 'Yeah, I gotta go ahead and give it to them.' I gotta drop it."[24] Dolph's seventh album, Rich Slave, was released on August 14, 2020. It was preceded by the singles "Blue Diamonds", "RNB" featuring Megan Thee Stallion and "Death Row". Dolph explained the album's title, stating "It's the reality of being Black in this country".[25] Rich Slave was Dolph's highest-charting album, peaking at 4th on the Billboard 200.[16] On March 5, 2021, Dolph and Key Glock released the single, "Aspen", and subsequently their second collaborative album, Dum and Dummer 2, was released on March 26, 2021, with 20 tracks. It is a sequel to 2019's Dum and Dummer, and combined solo songs with tracks featuring both artists.[20] The project's cartoon artwork references Beavis & Butthead.[26] The album was released by Dolph's independent Paper Route Empire label.[20] In a review on Pitchfork, Nadine Smith gave the album a 7.5/10 rating, stating that "Dolph & Glock fashion themselves in the image of pop culture dunces even if at the same time they’re poised, extravagant, and immaculate—there’s a casualness to their rapport and respective flows that never announces itself too much."[20] Personal life Thornton had two children, Tre Tre and Ari, with his partner Mia Jaye and said that he was somewhat strict with his parenting due to his upbringing with his grandmother.[10][27] He often collaborated with his cousin and fellow rapper Key Glock and was a distant relative of rapper and singer Juice Wrld, learning of the familial relation with the latter only shortly after his death.[28] Thornton was shot outside of a retail store in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on September 26, 2017.[29] He was listed in critical condition at the hospital, but within a few hours doctors said that he was expected to survive.[30] He spent two weeks in the hospital to recover from his three gunshot wounds.[31] Moments after the shooting, Yo Gotti was initially named as a person of interest in relation to the shooting.[32] Yo Gotti was later cleared; his friend Corey McClendon, meanwhile, was arrested for attempted murder but was released with no charges the next day.[33] Beginning during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Thornton began to stay in Memphis more frequently with his family amid rumors of retirement.[24] He was known in the area for his philanthropy, donating $25,000 to his alma mater Hamilton High School and providing motivational speeches to students.[11][34] Known for donating and handing out Thanksgiving dinners in Memphis, Thornton gave away two hundred turkeys to individuals at the West Cancer Center days before his death and was scheduled to donate additional meals days later.[11][35] Death On November 17, 2021, at around 1pm, Thornton was fatally shot while picking up cookies for his mother at a local shop in Memphis that he frequented; police said that an unidentified gunman entered the store and shot twice.[11][36] Crowds of hundreds of people swarmed the scene of Thornton's death for hours and police had to prevent individuals from entering the area while they investigated.[11] Tennessee House Representative London Lamar and Memphis councilman JB Smiley reacted by calling for a curfew to be established in Memphis to prevent civil unrest and violence.[35] Discography Studio albums Studio album, with selected information Title Album details Peak chart positions US [37] US R&B/HH [38] US Rap [39] King of Memphis Released: February 19, 2016 Label: Paper Route Empire Format: CD, LP, download 49 9 5 Bulletproof[40] Released: April 1, 2017 Label: Paper Route Empire Format: CD, download 36 19 14 Thinking Out Loud[41] Released: October 20, 2017 Label: Paper Route Empire Format: CD, download 16 9 8 Role Model Released: September 21, 2018 Label: Paper Route Empire Format: CD, download 15 11 9 Dum and Dummer (with Key Glock) Released: July 26, 2019[42] Label: Paper Route Empire Format: CD, download, streaming 8 [21] 5 4 Rich Slave Released: August 14, 2020 Label: Paper Route Empire Format: CD, download, streaming 4 3 3 Dum and Dummer 2 (with Key Glock)[26] Released: March 26, 2021 Label: Paper Route Empire Format: CD, download, streaming 8 5 4 "—" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory.

All the shit she was telling you, you get to seeing that shit when you hit about 15", saying that when he approached that age he began utilizing her teachings throughout his life to be more independent.[10] His grandmother often did not allow Dolph to have friends visit their home but on occasion let homeless friends stay with the family.[10] As a teenager, Dolph attended Hamilton High School.[11] Career 2008–2017: Early success and shootings In 2008, Young Dolph released his first mixtape Paper Route Campaign.[12] Two years later, he formally established his label Paper Route Empire in 2010, an independent record label not affiliated with a major record label, and subsequently released Welcome 2 Dolph World that same year.[12][9] With the release of mixtapes High Class Street Music and High Class Street Music Episode 2 in 2011, Dolph began to develop his own rap flow, shifting away from a style similar to Memphis rappers Three 6 Mafia and 8Ball & MJG instead to a personal style described as "vociferous" with a "magnetic delivery and uniquely deep voice".[13][14] With Dolph's increasing popularity, Memphis rapper Yo Gotti extended him a record deal on Gotti's Collective Music Group label affiliated with Epic Records in August 2014, but Dolph declined, preferring to remain independent.[14][13] In 2016, Young Dolph was featured on O.T. Genasis's hit double platinum single "Cut It". Later that year, he released his debut album King of Memphis under his independent Paper Route Empire label, which peaked at 49th on the Billboard 200.[13] Other Memphis rappers including Yo Gotti and Gotti-affiliated Blac Youngsta took offense to the album title, with Youngsta leading an armed group attempting to find Young Dolph in Memphis and releasing a diss track, "SHAKE SUM (Young Dolph Diss)" in response.[14] The following year, Dolph released a diss track against Yo Gotti entitled "Play Wit Yo' Bitch" prompting Gotti to release a response song. Two weeks later, in February 2017, Dolph released a music video for "Play Wit Yo' Bitch" and the next day, Young's vehicle was the target of gunfire in Charlotte, North Carolina, while in town for a performance at the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association tournament.[9][14][15] His car was reportedly shot over 100 times but was outfitted with bulletproof panels, and no one was hurt.[9][15] Following the shooting, Blac Youngsta and two other men were arrested, but the charges were later dropped due to insufficient evidence.[16] Young Dolph used the publicity from the shooting to promote his second studio album Bulletproof.[17] In September that same year, Dolph was shot multiple times, and in February 2018, he released the extended play Niggas Get Shot Everyday, referencing this prior incident.[9] 2017–2020: Charting singles and first top 10 album Young Dolph performing in 2017 In 2017, Young Dolph signed his cousin-by-marriage and fellow Memphis rapper Key Glock to his Paper Route Empire label after meeting at family gatherings.[12] In 2018, Young Dolph and Key Glock released the single "Major", which peaked at number 47 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.[18] That same year, Dolph said that he had been offered a $22 million label deal which he turned down. Preferring to stay on his own independent label, Dolph stated, "It really was a good deal, a super good deal to tell you the truth. But it's just, I see something else".[16] Dolph later revealed that he signed a record deal with Empire Distribution, and his September 2018 album Role Model was released under the label Paper Route EMPIRE, a joint venture between Paper Route Empire and Empire distribution.[19] In July 2019, Dolph again collaborated with Key Glock, this time releasing his first collaborative album entitled Dum and Dummer, imitating the title of the Farrelly brothers' film Dumb and Dumber.[20][12] The album peaked at number eight on the Billboard 200, earning each of the artists their first top 10 album.[21] The album was produced by BandPlay, who used a variety of styles of beats in the album's tracks.[22] Reviewers for the album noted Dolph's greater "songwriting range", with "depths of self-loathing and despair" that were complemented by the younger Key Glock's "celebrations of himself".[22] 2020–2021: Retirement rumors and top 10 solo album In early 2020, rumors emerged that Dolph was considering his retirement from music in order to spend more time with his children and was seen more frequently in Memphis.[23][24] On his Instagram, Dolph wrote, "Highly considering quitting the music business because I really wanna be with my kids 24/7".[23] During the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, Dolph released the single "Sunshine" and released edited album covers of previous releases on streaming services to feature individuals wearing surgical masks to highlight and address the global situation.[24] In an interview with GQ in May 2020, he was asked about his recent release of music, with Dolph replying "Man, my little boy wanted to hear some new music. ... I'll keep it real: I ain't really been on my rapper shit, I been on my industry shit, the big bro shit. I got a lot of artists, and I been dropping all my artists' projects, and they going up. ... So I'm like, 'Yeah, I gotta go ahead and give it to them.' I gotta drop it."[24] Dolph's seventh album, Rich Slave, was released on August 14, 2020. It was preceded by the singles "Blue Diamonds", "RNB" featuring Megan Thee Stallion and "Death Row". Dolph explained the album's title, stating "It's the reality of being Black in this country".[25] Rich Slave was Dolph's highest-charting album, peaking at 4th on the Billboard 200.[16] On March 5, 2021, Dolph and Key Glock released the single, "Aspen", and subsequently their second collaborative album, Dum and Dummer 2, was released on March 26, 2021, with 20 tracks. It is a sequel to 2019's Dum and Dummer, and combined solo songs with tracks featuring both artists.[20] The project's cartoon artwork references Beavis & Butthead.[26] The album was released by Dolph's independent Paper Route Empire label.[20] In a review on Pitchfork, Nadine Smith gave the album a 7.5/10 rating, stating that "Dolph & Glock fashion themselves in the image of pop culture dunces even if at the same time they’re poised, extravagant, and immaculate—there’s a casualness to their rapport and respective flows that never announces itself too much."[20] Personal life Thornton had two children, Tre Tre and Ari, with his partner Mia Jaye and said that he was somewhat strict with his parenting due to his upbringing with his grandmother.[10][27] He often collaborated with his cousin and fellow rapper Key Glock and was a distant relative of rapper and singer Juice Wrld, learning of the familial relation with the latter only shortly after his death.[28] Thornton was shot outside of a retail store in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on September 26, 2017.[29] He was listed in critical condition at the hospital, but within a few hours doctors said that he was expected to survive.[30] He spent two weeks in the hospital to recover from his three gunshot wounds.[31] Moments after the shooting, Yo Gotti was initially named as a person of interest in relation to the shooting.[32] Yo Gotti was later cleared; his friend Corey McClendon, meanwhile, was arrested for attempted murder but was released with no charges the next day.[33] Beginning during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Thornton began to stay in Memphis more frequently with his family amid rumors of retirement.[24] He was known in the area for his philanthropy, donating $25,000 to his alma mater Hamilton High School and providing motivational speeches to students.[11][34] Known for donating and handing out Thanksgiving dinners in Memphis, Thornton gave away two hundred turkeys to individuals at the West Cancer Center days before his death and was scheduled to donate additional meals days later.[11][35] Death On November 17, 2021, at around 1pm, Thornton was fatally shot while picking up cookies for his mother at a local shop in Memphis that he frequented; police said that an unidentified gunman entered the store and shot twice.[11][36] Crowds of hundreds of people swarmed the scene of Thornton's death for hours and police had to prevent individuals from entering the area while they investigated.[11] Tennessee House Representative London Lamar and Memphis councilman JB Smiley reacted by calling for a curfew to be established in Memphis to prevent civil unrest and violence.[35] Discography Studio albums Studio album, with selected information Title Album details Peak chart positions US [37] US R&B/HH [38] US Rap [39] King of Memphis Released: February 19, 2016 Label: Paper Route Empire Format: CD, LP, download 49 9 5 Bulletproof[40] Released: April 1, 2017 Label: Paper Route Empire Format: CD, download 36 19 14 Thinking Out Loud[41] Released: October 20, 2017 Label: Paper Route Empire Format: CD, download 16 9 8 Role Model Released: September 21, 2018 Label: Paper Route Empire Format: CD, download 15 11 9 Dum and Dummer (with Key Glock) Released: July 26, 2019[42] Label: Paper Route Empire Format: CD, download, streaming 8 [21] 5 4 Rich Slave Released: August 14, 2020 Label: Paper Route Empire Format: CD, download, streaming 4 3 3 Dum and Dummer 2 (with Key Glock)[26] Released: March 26, 2021 Label: Paper Route Empire Format: CD, download, streaming 8 5 4 "—" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory.

All the shit she was telling you, you get to seeing that shit when you hit about 15", saying that when he approached that age he began utilizing her teachings throughout his life to be more independent.[10] His grandmother often did not allow Dolph to have friends visit their home but on occasion let homeless friends stay with the family.[10] As a teenager, Dolph attended Hamilton High School.[11] Career 2008–2017: Early success and shootings In 2008, Young Dolph released his first mixtape Paper Route Campaign.[12] Two years later, he formally established his label Paper Route Empire in 2010, an independent record label not affiliated with a major record label, and subsequently released Welcome 2 Dolph World that same year.[12][9] With the release of mixtapes High Class Street Music and High Class Street Music Episode 2 in 2011, Dolph began to develop his own rap flow, shifting away from a style similar to Memphis rappers Three 6 Mafia and 8Ball & MJG instead to a personal style described as "vociferous" with a "magnetic delivery and uniquely deep voice".[13][14] With Dolph's increasing popularity, Memphis rapper Yo Gotti extended him a record deal on Gotti's Collective Music Group label affiliated with Epic Records in August 2014, but Dolph declined, preferring to remain independent.[14][13] In 2016, Young Dolph was featured on O.T. Genasis's hit double platinum single "Cut It". Later that year, he released his debut album King of Memphis under his independent Paper Route Empire label, which peaked at 49th on the Billboard 200.[13] Other Memphis rappers including Yo Gotti and Gotti-affiliated Blac Youngsta took offense to the album title, with Youngsta leading an armed group attempting to find Young Dolph in Memphis and releasing a diss track, "SHAKE SUM (Young Dolph Diss)" in response.[14] The following year, Dolph released a diss track against Yo Gotti entitled "Play Wit Yo' Bitch" prompting Gotti to release a response song. Two weeks later, in February 2017, Dolph released a music video for "Play Wit Yo' Bitch" and the next day, Young's vehicle was the target of gunfire in Charlotte, North Carolina, while in town for a performance at the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association tournament.[9][14][15] His car was reportedly shot over 100 times but was outfitted with bulletproof panels, and no one was hurt.[9][15] Following the shooting, Blac Youngsta and two other men were arrested, but the charges were later dropped due to insufficient evidence.[16] Young Dolph used the publicity from the shooting to promote his second studio album Bulletproof.[17] In September that same year, Dolph was shot multiple times, and in February 2018, he released the extended play Niggas Get Shot Everyday, referencing this prior incident.[9] 2017–2020: Charting singles and first top 10 album Young Dolph performing in 2017 In 2017, Young Dolph signed his cousin-by-marriage and fellow Memphis rapper Key Glock to his Paper Route Empire label after meeting at family gatherings.[12] In 2018, Young Dolph and Key Glock released the single "Major", which peaked at number 47 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.[18] That same year, Dolph said that he had been offered a $22 million label deal which he turned down. Preferring to stay on his own independent label, Dolph stated, "It really was a good deal, a super good deal to tell you the truth. But it's just, I see something else".[16] Dolph later revealed that he signed a record deal with Empire Distribution, and his September 2018 album Role Model was released under the label Paper Route EMPIRE, a joint venture between Paper Route Empire and Empire distribution.[19] In July 2019, Dolph again collaborated with Key Glock, this time releasing his first collaborative album entitled Dum and Dummer, imitating the title of the Farrelly brothers' film Dumb and Dumber.[20][12] The album peaked at number eight on the Billboard 200, earning each of the artists their first top 10 album.[21] The album was produced by BandPlay, who used a variety of styles of beats in the album's tracks.[22] Reviewers for the album noted Dolph's greater "songwriting range", with "depths of self-loathing and despair" that were complemented by the younger Key Glock's "celebrations of himself".[22] 2020–2021: Retirement rumors and top 10 solo album In early 2020, rumors emerged that Dolph was considering his retirement from music in order to spend more time with his children and was seen more frequently in Memphis.[23][24] On his Instagram, Dolph wrote, "Highly considering quitting the music business because I really wanna be with my kids 24/7".[23] During the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, Dolph released the single "Sunshine" and released edited album covers of previous releases on streaming services to feature individuals wearing surgical masks to highlight and address the global situation.[24] In an interview with GQ in May 2020, he was asked about his recent release of music, with Dolph replying "Man, my little boy wanted to hear some new music. ... I'll keep it real: I ain't really been on my rapper shit, I been on my industry shit, the big bro shit. I got a lot of artists, and I been dropping all my artists' projects, and they going up. ... So I'm like, 'Yeah, I gotta go ahead and give it to them.' I gotta drop it."[24] Dolph's seventh album, Rich Slave, was released on August 14, 2020. It was preceded by the singles "Blue Diamonds", "RNB" featuring Megan Thee Stallion and "Death Row". Dolph explained the album's title, stating "It's the reality of being Black in this country".[25] Rich Slave was Dolph's highest-charting album, peaking at 4th on the Billboard 200.[16] On March 5, 2021, Dolph and Key Glock released the single, "Aspen", and subsequently their second collaborative album, Dum and Dummer 2, was released on March 26, 2021, with 20 tracks. It is a sequel to 2019's Dum and Dummer, and combined solo songs with tracks featuring both artists.[20] The project's cartoon artwork references Beavis & Butthead.[26] The album was released by Dolph's independent Paper Route Empire label.[20] In a review on Pitchfork, Nadine Smith gave the album a 7.5/10 rating, stating that "Dolph & Glock fashion themselves in the image of pop culture dunces even if at the same time they’re poised, extravagant, and immaculate—there’s a casualness to their rapport and respective flows that never announces itself too much."[20] Personal life Thornton had two children, Tre Tre and Aria, with his partner, Mia Jaye. He said that he was somewhat strict with his parenting due to his upbringing with his grandmother.[10][27] Thornton often collaborated with his cousin and fellow rapper Key Glock and was a distant relative of the rapper and singer Juice Wrld, learning of the familial relation with the latter only shortly after his death.[28] Thornton was shot outside a retail store in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on September 26, 2017.[29] He was listed in critical condition at the hospital; but within a few hours, doctors reported he was expected to survive.[30] He spent two weeks in the hospital recovering from three gunshot wounds.[31] Yo Gotti was initially named a person of interest moments after the shooting but was later cleared.[32] Meanwhile, Gotti's friend, Corey McClendon, was arrested for attempted murder, only to be released the next day with no charges.[33] During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Thornton began to stay with his family in Memphis more frequently and did so amid rumors of retirement.[24] He was known in the area for his philanthropy, donating $25,000 to his alma mater, Hamilton High School, and providing motivational speeches to students.[11][34] Known for handing out Thanksgiving dinners, Thornton gave away two hundred turkeys to individuals at the West Cancer Center days before his death and was scheduled to donate additional meals days later.[11][35] Death On November 17, 2021, at around 1 pm, Thornton was fatally shot in Memphis while picking up cookies for his mother at a local shop that he frequented; police said an unidentified gunman entered the store and shot twice.[11][36] Crowds of hundreds of people swarmed the scene of Thornton's death for hours, and police had to prevent individuals from entering the area while they investigated.[11] Tennessee House Representative London Lamar and Memphis councilman J. B. Smiley reacted by calling for a curfew in Memphis to prevent civil unrest and violence.[35] Discography Studio albums Studio album, with selected information Title Album details Peak chart positions US [37] US R&B/HH [38] US Rap [39] King of Memphis Released: February 19, 2016 Label: Paper Route Empire Format: CD, LP, download 49 9 5 Bulletproof[40] Released: April 1, 2017 Label: Paper Route Empire Format: CD, download 36 19 14 Thinking Out Loud[41] Released: October 20, 2017 Label: Paper Route Empire Format: CD, download 16 9 8 Role Model Released: September 21, 2018 Label: Paper Route Empire Format: CD, download 15 11 9 Dum and Dummer (with Key Glock) Released: July 26, 2019[42] Label: Paper Route Empire Format: CD, download, streaming 8 [21] 5 4 Rich Slave Released: August 14, 2020 Label: Paper Route Empire Format: CD, download, streaming 4 3 3 Dum and Dummer 2 (with Key Glock)[26] Released: March 26, 2021 Label: Paper Route Empire Format: CD, download, streaming 8 5 4 "—" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory.

All the shit she was telling you, you get to seeing that shit when you hit about 15", saying that when he approached that age he began utilizing her teachings throughout his life to be more independent.[10] His grandmother often did not allow Dolph to have friends visit their home but on occasion let homeless friends stay with the family.[10] As a teenager, Dolph attended Hamilton High School.[11] Career 2008–2017: Early success and shootings In 2008, Young Dolph released his first mixtape Paper Route Campaign.[12] Two years later, he formally established his label Paper Route Empire in 2010, an independent record label not affiliated with a major record label, and subsequently released Welcome 2 Dolph World that same year.[12][9] With the release of mixtapes High Class Street Music and High Class Street Music Episode 2 in 2011, Dolph began to develop his own rap flow, shifting away from a style similar to Memphis rappers Three 6 Mafia and 8Ball & MJG instead to a personal style described as "vociferous" with a "magnetic delivery and uniquely deep voice".[13][14] With Dolph's increasing popularity, Memphis rapper Yo Gotti extended him a record deal on Gotti's Collective Music Group label affiliated with Epic Records in August 2014, but Dolph declined, preferring to remain independent.[14][13] In 2016, Young Dolph was featured on O.T. Genasis's hit double platinum single "Cut It". Later that year, he released his debut album King of Memphis under his independent Paper Route Empire label, which peaked at 49th on the Billboard 200.[13] Other Memphis rappers including Yo Gotti and Gotti-affiliated Blac Youngsta took offense to the album title, with Youngsta leading an armed group attempting to find Young Dolph in Memphis and releasing a diss track, "SHAKE SUM (Young Dolph Diss)" in response.[14] The following year, Dolph released a diss track against Yo Gotti entitled "Play Wit Yo' Bitch" prompting Gotti to release a response song. Two weeks later, in February 2017, Dolph released a music video for "Play Wit Yo' Bitch" and the next day, Young's vehicle was the target of gunfire in Charlotte, North Carolina, while in town for a performance at the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association tournament.[9][14][15] His car was reportedly shot over 100 times but was outfitted with bulletproof panels, and no one was hurt.[9][15] Following the shooting, Blac Youngsta and two other men were arrested, but the charges were later dropped due to insufficient evidence.[16] Young Dolph used the publicity from the shooting to promote his second studio album Bulletproof.[17] In September that same year, Dolph was shot multiple times, and in February 2018, he released the extended play Niggas Get Shot Everyday, referencing this prior incident.[9] 2017–2020: Charting singles and first top 10 album Young Dolph performing in 2017 In 2017, Young Dolph signed his cousin-by-marriage and fellow Memphis rapper Key Glock to his Paper Route Empire label after meeting at family gatherings.[12] In 2018, Young Dolph and Key Glock released the single "Major", which peaked at number 47 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.[18] That same year, Dolph said that he had been offered a $22 million label deal which he turned down. Preferring to stay on his own independent label, Dolph stated, "It really was a good deal, a super good deal to tell you the truth. But it's just, I see something else".[16] Dolph later revealed that he signed a record deal with Empire Distribution, and his September 2018 album Role Model was released under the label Paper Route EMPIRE, a joint venture between Paper Route Empire and Empire distribution.[19] In July 2019, Dolph again collaborated with Key Glock, this time releasing his first collaborative album entitled Dum and Dummer, imitating the title of the Farrelly brothers' film Dumb and Dumber.[20][12] The album peaked at number eight on the Billboard 200, earning each of the artists their first top 10 album.[21] The album was produced by BandPlay, who used a variety of styles of beats in the album's tracks.[22] Reviewers for the album noted Dolph's greater "songwriting range", with "depths of self-loathing and despair" that were complemented by the younger Key Glock's "celebrations of himself".[22] 2020–2021: Retirement rumors and top 10 solo album In early 2020, rumors emerged that Dolph was considering his retirement from music in order to spend more time with his children and was seen more frequently in Memphis.[23][24] On his Instagram, Dolph wrote, "Highly considering quitting the music business because I really wanna be with my kids 24/7".[23] During the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, Dolph released the single "Sunshine" and released edited album covers of previous releases on streaming services to feature individuals wearing surgical masks to highlight and address the global situation.[24] In an interview with GQ in May 2020, he was asked about his recent release of music, with Dolph replying "Man, my little boy wanted to hear some new music. ... I'll keep it real: I ain't really been on my rapper shit, I been on my industry shit, the big bro shit. I got a lot of artists, and I been dropping all my artists' projects, and they going up. ... So I'm like, 'Yeah, I gotta go ahead and give it to them.' I gotta drop it."[24] Dolph's seventh album, Rich Slave, was released on August 14, 2020. It was preceded by the singles "Blue Diamonds", "RNB" featuring Megan Thee Stallion and "Death Row". Dolph explained the album's title, stating "It's the reality of being Black in this country".[25] Rich Slave was Dolph's highest-charting album, peaking at 4th on the Billboard 200.[16] On March 5, 2021, Dolph and Key Glock released the single, "Aspen", and subsequently their second collaborative album, Dum and Dummer 2, was released on March 26, 2021, with 20 tracks. It is a sequel to 2019's Dum and Dummer, and combined solo songs with tracks featuring both artists.[20] The project's cartoon artwork references Beavis & Butthead.[26] The album was released by Dolph's independent Paper Route Empire label.[20] In a review on Pitchfork, Nadine Smith gave the album a 7.5/10 rating, stating that "Dolph & Glock fashion themselves in the image of pop culture dunces even if at the same time they’re poised, extravagant, and immaculate—there’s a casualness to their rapport and respective flows that never announces itself too much."[20] Personal life Thornton had two children, Tre Tre and Aria, with his partner, Mia Jaye. He said that he was somewhat strict with his parenting due to his upbringing with his grandmother.[10][27] Thornton often collaborated with his cousin and fellow rapper Key Glock and was a distant relative of the rapper and singer Juice Wrld, learning of the familial relation with the latter only shortly after his death.[28] Thornton was shot outside a retail store in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on September 26, 2017.[29] He was listed in critical condition at the hospital; but within a few hours, doctors reported he was expected to survive.[30] He spent two weeks in the hospital recovering from three gunshot wounds.[31] Yo Gotti was initially named a person of interest moments after the shooting but was later cleared.[32] Meanwhile, Gotti's friend, Corey McClendon, was arrested for attempted murder, only to be released the next day with no charges.[33] During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Thornton began to stay with his family in Memphis more frequently and did so amid rumors of retirement.[24] He was known in the area for his philanthropy, donating $25,000 to his alma mater, Hamilton High School, and providing motivational speeches to students.[11][34] Known for handing out Thanksgiving dinners, Thornton gave away two hundred turkeys to individuals at the West Cancer Center days before his death and was scheduled to donate additional meals days later.[11][35] Death On November 17, 2021, at around 1 pm, Thornton was fatally shot in Memphis while picking up cookies for his mother at a local shop that he frequented; police said an unidentified gunman entered the store and shot twice.[11][36] Crowds of hundreds of people swarmed the scene of Thornton's death for hours, and police had to prevent individuals from entering the area while they investigated.[11] Tennessee House Representative London Lamar and Memphis councilman J. B. Smiley reacted by calling for a curfew in Memphis to prevent civil unrest and violence.[35] Discography Studio albums Studio album, with selected information Title Album details Peak chart positions US [37] US R&B/HH [38] US Rap [39] King of Memphis Released: February 19, 2016 Label: Paper Route Empire Format: CD, LP, download 49 9 5 Bulletproof[40] Released: April 1, 2017 Label: Paper Route Empire Format: CD, download 36 19 14 Thinking Out Loud[41] Released: October 20, 2017 Label: Paper Route Empire Format: CD, download 16 9 8 Role Model Released: September 21, 2018 Label: Paper Route Empire Format: CD, download 15 11 9 Dum and Dummer (with Key Glock) Released: July 26, 2019[42] Label: Paper Route Empire Format: CD, download, streaming 8 [21] 5 4 Rich Slave Released: August 14, 2020 Label: Paper Route Empire Format: CD, download, streaming 4 3 3 Dum and Dummer 2 (with Key Glock)[26] Released: March 26, 2021 Label: Paper Route Empire Format: CD, download, streaming 8 5 4 "—" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory.

All the shit she was telling you, you get to seeing that shit when you hit about 15", saying that when he approached that age he began utilizing her teachings throughout his life to be more independent.[10] His grandmother often did not allow Dolph to have friends visit their home but on occasion let homeless friends stay with the family.[10] As a teenager, Dolph attended Hamilton High School.[11] Career[edit] 2008–2017: success and shootings[edit] In 2008, Young Dolph released his first mixtape Paper Route Campaign.[12] Two years later, he formally established his label Paper Route Empire in 2010, an independent record label not affiliated with a major record label, and subsequently released Welcome 2 Dolph World that same year.[12][9] With the release of mixtapes High Class Street Music and High Class Street Music Episode 2 in 2011, Dolph began to develop his own rap flow, shifting away from a style similar to Memphis rappers Three 6 Mafia and 8Ball & MJG instead to a personal style described as "vociferous" with a "magnetic delivery and uniquely deep voice".[13][14] With Dolph's increasing popularity, Memphis rapper Yo Gotti extended him a record deal on Gotti's Collective Music Group label affiliated with Epic Records in August 2014, but Dolph declined, preferring to remain independent.[14][13] In 2016, Young Dolph was featured on O.T. Genasis's hit double platinum single "Cut It". Later that year, he released his debut album King of Memphis under his independent Paper Route Empire label, which peaked at 49th on the Billboard 200.[13] Other Memphis rappers including Yo Gotti and Gotti-affiliated Blac Youngsta took offense to the album title, with Youngsta leading an armed group attempting to find Young Dolph in Memphis and releasing a diss track, "SHAKE SUM (Young Dolph Diss)" in response.[14] The following year, Dolph released a diss track against Yo Gotti entitled "Play Wit Yo' Bitch" prompting Gotti to release a response song. Two weeks later, in February 2017, Dolph released a music video for "Play Wit Yo' Bitch" and the next day, Young's vehicle was the target of gunfire in Charlotte, North Carolina, while in town for a performance at the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association tournament.[9][14][15] His car was reportedly shot over 100 times but was outfitted with bulletproof panels, and no one was hurt.[9][15] Following the shooting, Blac Youngsta and two other men were arrested, but the charges were later dropped due to insufficient evidence.[16] Young Dolph used the publicity from the shooting to promote his second studio album Bulletproof.[17] In September that same year, Dolph was shot multiple times, and in February 2018, he released the extended play Niggas Get Shot Everyday, referencing this prior incident.[9] 2017–2020: Charting singles and first top 10 album[edit] Young Dolph performing in 2017 In 2017, Young Dolph signed his cousin-by-marriage and fellow Memphis rapper Key Glock to his Paper Route Empire label after meeting at family gatherings.[12] In 2018, Young Dolph and Key Glock released the single "Major", which peaked at number 47 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.[18] That same year, Dolph said that he had been offered a $22 million label deal which he turned down. Preferring to stay on his own independent label, Dolph stated, "It really was a good deal, a super good deal to tell you the truth. But it's just, I see something else".[16] Dolph later revealed that he signed a record deal with Empire Distribution, and his September 2018 album Role Model was released under the label Paper Route EMPIRE, a joint venture between Paper Route Empire and Empire distribution.[19] In July 2019, Dolph again collaborated with Key Glock, this time releasing his first collaborative album entitled Dum and Dummer, imitating the title of the Farrelly brothers' film Dumb and Dumber.[20][12] The album peaked at number eight on the Billboard 200, earning each of the artists their first top 10 album.[21] The album was produced by BandPlay, who used a variety of styles of beats in the album's tracks.[22] Reviewers for the album noted Dolph's greater "songwriting range", with "depths of self-loathing and despair" that were complemented by the younger Key Glock's "celebrations of himself".[22] 2020–2021: Retirement rumors and top 10 solo album[edit] In early 2020, rumors emerged that Dolph was considering his retirement from music in order to spend more time with his children and was seen more frequently in Memphis.[23][24] On his Instagram, Dolph wrote, "Highly considering quitting the music business because I really wanna be with my kids 24/7".[23] During the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, Dolph released the single "Sunshine" and released edited album covers of previous releases on streaming services to feature individuals wearing surgical masks to highlight and address the global situation.[24] In an interview with GQ in May 2020, he was asked about his recent release of music, with Dolph replying "Man, my little boy wanted to hear some new music. ... I'll keep it real: I ain't really been on my rapper shit, I been on my industry shit, the big bro shit. I got a lot of artists, and I been dropping all my artists' projects, and they going up. ... So I'm like, 'Yeah, I gotta go ahead and give it to them.' I gotta drop it."[24] Dolph's seventh album, Rich Slave, was released on August 14, 2020. It was preceded by the singles "Blue Diamonds", "RNB" featuring Megan Thee Stallion and "Death Row". Dolph explained the album's title, stating "It's the reality of being Black in this country".[25] Rich Slave was Dolph's highest-charting album, peaking at 4th on the Billboard 200.[16] On March 5, 2021, Dolph and Key Glock released the single, "Aspen", and subsequently their second collaborative album, Dum and Dummer 2, was released on March 26, 2021, with 20 tracks. It is a sequel to 2019's Dum and Dummer, and combined solo songs with tracks featuring both artists.[20] The project's cartoon artwork references Beavis & Butthead.[26] The album was released by Dolph's independent Paper Route Empire label.[20] In a review on Pitchfork, Nadine Smith gave the album a 7.5/10 rating, stating that "Dolph & Glock fashion themselves in the image of pop culture dunces even if at the same time they’re poised, extravagant, and immaculate—there’s a casualness to their rapport and respective flows that never announces itself too much."[20] Personal life[edit] Thornton had two children, Tre Tre and Aria, with his partner, Mia Jaye. He said that he was somewhat strict with his parenting due to his upbringing with his grandmother.[10][27] Thornton often collaborated with his cousin and fellow rapper Key Glock and was a distant relative of the rapper and singer Juice Wrld, learning of the familial relation with the latter in 2017.[28][29] Thornton was shot outside a retail store in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on September 26, 2017.[30] He was listed in critical condition at the hospital; but within a few hours, doctors reported he was expected to survive.[31] He spent two weeks in the hospital recovering from three gunshot wounds.[32] Yo Gotti was initially named a person of interest moments after the shooting but was later cleared.[33] Meanwhile, Gotti's friend, Corey McClendon, was arrested for attempted murder, only to be released the next day with no charges.[34] During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Thornton began to stay with his family in Memphis more frequently and did so amid rumors of retirement.[24] He was known in the area for his philanthropy, donating $25,000 to his alma mater, Hamilton High School, and providing motivational speeches to students.[11][35] Known for handing out Thanksgiving dinners, Thornton gave away two hundred turkeys to individuals at the West Cancer Center days before his death and was scheduled to donate additional meals days later.[11][36] Death[edit] On November 17, 2021, at 12:22 pm, Thornton was fatally shot in Memphis while picking up cookies for his mother at Makeda's Homemade "Butter Cookies", a bakery he frequented whenever back home; Two unidentified gunmen hopped out of a white two door Mercedes Benz and gunned down the rapper from Castalia. Thornton was recorded mere moments before via a fan's smartphone at a Marathon gas station located just a few miles from where he was ultimately shot. [37][11][38] Crowds of hundreds of people swarmed the scene of Thornton's death for hours where police had to prevent individuals from entering the area while they investigated.[11] Tennessee House Representative London Lamar and Memphis councilman J. B. Smiley reacted by calling for a curfew in Memphis to prevent civil unrest and violence.[36] Discography[edit] Studio albums[edit] Studio album, with selected information Title Album details Peak chart positions US [39] US R&B/HH [40] US Rap [41] King of Memphis Released: February 19, 2016 Label: Paper Route Empire Format: CD, LP, download 49 9 5 Bulletproof[42] Released: April 1, 2017 Label: Paper Route Empire Format: CD, download 36 19 14 Thinking Out Loud[43] Released: October 20, 2017 Label: Paper Route Empire Format: CD, download 16 9 8 Role Model Released: September 21, 2018 Label: Paper Route Empire Format: CD, download 15 11 9 Dum and Dummer (with Key Glock) Released: July 26, 2019[44] Label: Paper Route Empire Format: CD, download, streaming 8 [21] 5 4 Rich Slave Released: August 14, 2020 Label: Paper Route Empire Format: CD, download, streaming 4 3 3 Dum and Dummer 2 (with Key Glock)[26] Released: March 26, 2021 Label: Paper Route Empire Format: CD, download, streaming 8 5 4 "—" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory.

All the shit she was telling you, you get to seeing that shit when you hit about 15", saying that when he approached that age he began utilizing her teachings throughout his life to be more independent.[10] His grandmother often did not allow Dolph to have friends visit their home but on occasion let homeless friends stay with the family.[10] As a teenager, Dolph attended Hamilton High School.[11] Career[edit] 2008–2017: success and shootings[edit] In 2008, Young Dolph released his first mixtape Paper Route Campaign.[12] Two years later, he formally established his label Paper Route Empire in 2010, an independent record label not affiliated with a major record label, and subsequently released Welcome 2 Dolph World that same year.[12][9] With the release of mixtapes High Class Street Music and High Class Street Music Episode 2 in 2011, Dolph began to develop his own rap flow, shifting away from a style similar to Memphis rappers Three 6 Mafia and 8Ball & MJG instead to a personal style described as "vociferous" with a "magnetic delivery and uniquely deep voice".[13][14] With Dolph's increasing popularity, Memphis rapper Yo Gotti extended him a record deal on Gotti's Collective Music Group label affiliated with Epic Records in August 2014, but Dolph declined, preferring to remain independent.[14][13] In 2016, Young Dolph was featured on O.T. Genasis's hit double platinum single "Cut It". Later that year, he released his debut album King of Memphis under his independent Paper Route Empire label, which peaked at 49th on the Billboard 200.[13] Other Memphis rappers including Yo Gotti and Gotti-affiliated Blac Youngsta took offense to the album title, with Youngsta leading an armed group attempting to find Young Dolph in Memphis and releasing a diss track, "SHAKE SUM (Young Dolph Diss)" in response.[14] The following year, Dolph released a diss track against Yo Gotti entitled "Play Wit Yo' Bitch" prompting Gotti to release a response song. Two weeks later, in February 2017, Dolph released a music video for "Play Wit Yo' Bitch" and the next day, Young's vehicle was the target of gunfire in Charlotte, North Carolina, while in town for a performance at the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association tournament.[9][14][15] His car was reportedly shot over 100 times but was outfitted with bulletproof panels, and no one was hurt.[9][15] Following the shooting, Blac Youngsta and two other men were arrested, but the charges were later dropped due to insufficient evidence.[16] Young Dolph used the publicity from the shooting to promote his second studio album Bulletproof.[17] In September that same year, Dolph was shot multiple times, and in February 2018, he released the extended play Niggas Get Shot Everyday, referencing this prior incident.[9] 2017–2020: Charting singles and first top 10 album[edit] Young Dolph performing in 2017 In 2017, Young Dolph signed his cousin-by-marriage and fellow Memphis rapper Key Glock to his Paper Route Empire label after meeting at family gatherings.[12] In 2018, Young Dolph and Key Glock released the single "Major", which peaked at number 47 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.[18] That same year, Dolph said that he had been offered a $22 million label deal which he turned down. Preferring to stay on his own independent label, Dolph stated, "It really was a good deal, a super good deal to tell you the truth. But it's just, I see something else".[16] Dolph later revealed that he signed a record deal with Empire Distribution, and his September 2018 album Role Model was released under the label Paper Route EMPIRE, a joint venture between Paper Route Empire and Empire distribution.[19] In July 2019, Dolph again collaborated with Key Glock, this time releasing his first collaborative album entitled Dum and Dummer, imitating the title of the Farrelly brothers' film Dumb and Dumber.[20][12] The album peaked at number eight on the Billboard 200, earning each of the artists their first top 10 album.[21] The album was produced by BandPlay, who used a variety of styles of beats in the album's tracks.[22] Reviewers for the album noted Dolph's greater "songwriting range", with "depths of self-loathing and despair" that were complemented by the younger Key Glock's "celebrations of himself".[22] 2020–2021: Retirement rumors and top 10 solo album[edit] In early 2020, rumors emerged that Dolph was considering his retirement from music in order to spend more time with his children and was seen more frequently in Memphis.[23][24] On his Instagram, Dolph wrote, "Highly considering quitting the music business because I really wanna be with my kids 24/7".[23] During the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, Dolph released the single "Sunshine" and released edited album covers of previous releases on streaming services to feature individuals wearing surgical masks to highlight and address the global situation.[24] In an interview with GQ in May 2020, he was asked about his recent release of music, with Dolph replying "Man, my little boy wanted to hear some new music. ... I'll keep it real: I ain't really been on my rapper shit, I been on my industry shit, the big bro shit. I got a lot of artists, and I been dropping all my artists' projects, and they going up. ... So I'm like, 'Yeah, I gotta go ahead and give it to them.' I gotta drop it."[24] Dolph's seventh album, Rich Slave, was released on August 14, 2020. It was preceded by the singles "Blue Diamonds", "RNB" featuring Megan Thee Stallion and "Death Row". Dolph explained the album's title, stating "It's the reality of being Black in this country".[25] Rich Slave was Dolph's highest-charting album, peaking at 4th on the Billboard 200.[16] On March 5, 2021, Dolph and Key Glock released the single, "Aspen", and subsequently their second collaborative album, Dum and Dummer 2, was released on March 26, 2021, with 20 tracks. It is a sequel to 2019's Dum and Dummer, and combined solo songs with tracks featuring both artists.[20] The project's cartoon artwork references Beavis & Butthead.[26] The album was released by Dolph's independent Paper Route Empire label.[20] In a review on Pitchfork, Nadine Smith gave the album a 7.5/10 rating, stating that "Dolph & Glock fashion themselves in the image of pop culture dunces even if at the same time they’re poised, extravagant, and immaculate—there’s a casualness to their rapport and respective flows that never announces itself too much."[20] Personal life[edit] Thornton had two children, Tre Tre and Aria, with his partner, Mia Jaye. He said that he was somewhat strict with his parenting due to his upbringing with his grandmother.[10][27] Thornton often collaborated with his cousin and fellow rapper Key Glock and was a distant relative of the rapper and singer Juice Wrld, learning of the familial relation with the latter in 2017.[28][29] Thornton was shot outside a retail store in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on September 26, 2017.[30] He was listed in critical condition at the hospital; but within a few hours, doctors reported he was expected to survive.[31] He spent two weeks in the hospital recovering from three gunshot wounds.[32] Yo Gotti was initially named a person of interest moments after the shooting but was later cleared.[33] Meanwhile, Gotti's friend, Corey McClendon, was arrested for attempted murder, only to be released the next day with no charges.[34] During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Thornton began to stay with his family in Memphis more frequently and did so amid rumors of retirement.[24] He was known in the area for his philanthropy, donating $25,000 to his alma mater, Hamilton High School, and providing motivational speeches to students.[11][35] Known for handing out Thanksgiving dinners, Thornton gave away two hundred turkeys to individuals at the West Cancer Center days before his death and was scheduled to donate additional meals days later.[11][36] Death[edit] On November 17, 2021, at 12:22 pm, Thornton was fatally shot in Memphis while picking up cookies for his mother at Makeda's Homemade "Butter Cookies", a bakery he frequented whenever back home; Two unidentified gunmen hopped out of a white two door Mercedes Benz and gunned down the rapper from Castalia. Thornton was recorded mere moments before via a fan's smartphone at a Marathon gas station located just a few miles from where he was ultimately shot. [37][11][38] Crowds of hundreds of people swarmed the scene of Thornton's death for hours where police had to prevent individuals from entering the area while they investigated.[11] Tennessee House Representative London Lamar and Memphis councilman J. B. Smiley reacted by calling for a curfew in Memphis to prevent civil unrest and violence.[36] Discography[edit] Studio albums[edit] Studio album, with selected information Title Album details Peak chart positions US [39] US R&B/HH [40] US Rap [41] King of Memphis Released: February 19, 2016 Label: Paper Route Empire Format: CD, LP, download 49 9 5 Bulletproof[42] Released: April 1, 2017 Label: Paper Route Empire Format: CD, download 36 19 14 Thinking Out Loud[43] Released: October 20, 2017 Label: Paper Route Empire Format: CD, download 16 9 8 Role Model Released: September 21, 2018 Label: Paper Route Empire Format: CD, download 15 11 9 Dum and Dummer (with Key Glock) Released: July 26, 2019[44] Label: Paper Route Empire Format: CD, download, streaming 8 [21] 5 4 Rich Slave Released: August 14, 2020 Label: Paper Route Empire Format: CD, download, streaming 4 3 3 Dum and Dummer 2 (with Key Glock)[26] Released: March 26, 2021 Label: Paper Route Empire Format: CD, download, streaming 8 5 4 "—" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory.
