Children 2 Education Stockholm School of Economics Eva Magdalena Andersson (Swedish pronunciation: [e?va ma?dalena and???n]) (born 23 January 1967) is a Swedish Social Democratic politician who has served as leader of the Social Democratic Party since 4 November 2021.[1] On 24 November 2021, the Swedish Riksdag elected her as Sweden's first female Prime Minister, thereby ending Sweden's status as the only Nordic country never to have elected a woman as head of government.[2][3] A few hours later, she resigned without taking office as her coalition collapsed after it failed to pass a budget and the Green Party refused to govern with the oppositional budget.[4] Contents 1 Biography 1.1 Early life 1.2 Education 2 Career 2.1 Adviser and civil servant 2.2 Minister for Finance 2.3 Leader of the Social Democratic Party 2.4 Prime Minister elect of Sweden (2021) 3 Other roles 4 Personal life 5 References Biography[edit] Early life[edit] Andersson is the only child of Göran Andersson (1936–2002), a lecturer in statistics at Uppsala University, and teacher Birgitta Andersson (née Grunell) (born 1939).[5] Andersson was an elite-level swimmer in her youth.[6][7] Education[edit] During her high school years, Andersson studied social sciences at the Cathedral School in Uppsala. She graduated in 1987 with top grades in all but one class.[8] After graduating from high school, Andersson moved to Stockholm to study at the Stockholm School of Economics,[9] where she graduated in 1992 with a master's degree in economics. She then worked as a doctoral student in economics at the Stockholm School of Economics in the years 1992–1995 but ended her studies in advance. In the autumn of 1994, she studied at the Institute of Advanced Studies in Vienna. In the spring of 1995, she studied at Harvard University.[10] Andersson joined the Social Democratic Youth League (SSU) in 1983, during her first year of secondary school.[11] In 1987, she was elected president of the Uppsala section of SSU.[12] Career[edit] Adviser and civil servant[edit] After completing her studies in economics, Andersson gained employment in the Prime Minister's Office as a political adviser to Göran Persson from 1996 to 1998, and later served as Director of Planning from 1998 to 2004. She then spent time in the civil service, working as Secretary of state in the Ministry of Finance from 2004 to 2006, before leaving to again become a political adviser, this time to Opposition Leader Mona Sahlin, from 2007 to 2009. She left this role when the Government nominated her for the role of Chief Director of the Swedish Tax Agency, a position she held until 2012. She resigned upon her adoption as a Social Democratic candidate ahead of the 2014 general election.[13] Minister for Finance[edit] Andersson with her first government budget (known as nådiga luntan) outside the Parliament on 23 October 2014 After the Social Democratic victory in the 2014 Swedish general election in which Andersson was elected as a member of the Riksdag, she was appointed as the Minister for Finance by new prime minister Stefan Löfven in his cabinet.[14] As a result of coalition negotiations, while Andersson had overall responsibility for the Finance Ministry, Per Bolund was given responsibility for the oversight of financial markets and consumer protection as the Minister for Financial Markets.[15] Andersson was reappointed as Finance Minister by Löfven following the 2018 election.[16] In 2020, members of the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC), the primary policy advisory committee of the Board of Governors of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), chose Andersson to serve as Chair of the Committee for a term of three years.[17] She became the first European in that role after more than a decade, as well as the first woman to hold that position.[18] In August 2021, Prime Minister Stefan Löfven announced he would resign as party leader at the Social Democratic Party Congress in November 2021.[19] Andersson was quickly regarded by many as the most likely candidate to succeed him, and on 29 September, the Social Democratic Party nominating committee announced that Andersson had been chosen as leader-designate ahead of the congress; should the designation be accepted by the Riksdag, Andersson would become leader and Sweden's first female Prime Minister.[20][21] Leader of the Social Democratic Party[edit] Andersson was elected Leader of the Social Democratic Party on 4 November 2021,[22] becoming the party's second female leader after Mona Sahlin.[23] On 10 November, Prime Minister Löfven formally resigned from office.[24] As part of the government formation process, the Speaker of the Riksdag held talks with all party leaders on 11 November and shortly after tasked Andersson with forming a government, giving her one week.[25] On 23 November 2021, it was announced that Andersson has reached an agreement with the Left Party to support her at the upcoming prime ministerial vote. With the Centre Party having previously agreed to support her, Andersson had the required number of MPs to become Sweden's next prime minister.[26] Prime Minister elect of Sweden (2021)[edit] On 24 November 2021, Andersson was elected as Sweden's new prime minister by the Riksdag.[3] At the time of her election, she would have assumed office formally on 26 November 2021.[27] Although she did not receive a majority of "yes" votes, she also did not receive a majority of "no" votes, which under the Riksdag's principle of negative parliamentarism was sufficient to elect her as prime minister.[3] Andersson is Sweden's first female head of government since universal suffrage was introduced in 1921.[28] A few hours after being elected, Andersson announced her decision to resign as Prime Minister after the Green Party refused to govern using the opposition's budget and left the coalition. Andersson's resignation was based on the convention that a Prime Minister should resign if a party leaves the governing coalition. She notified Speaker Andreas Norlén that she is interested in leading a social democratic one-party government.[29][30] Other roles[edit] Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), Ex-Officio Member of the Board of Governors[31] European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Ex-Officio Member of the Board of Governors[32] European Investment Bank (EIB), Ex-Officio Member of the Board of Governors (since 2014)[33] Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), World Bank Group, Ex-Officio Member of the Board of Governors[34] Nordic Investment Bank (NIB), Ex-Officio Chairwoman of the Board of Governors[35] World Bank, Ex-Officio Member of the Board of Governors[36] Policy Network, Member of the Board (2005–2009)[37] Personal life[edit] Andersson is married to Richard Friberg [sv], a professor in economics at the Stockholm School of Economics, since 1997, with whom she has two children.[38] She and her husband are avid outdoors people; they often go hiking, kayaking and mountaineering.[39] References[edit] ^ Dutt, Sujay (4 November 2021).

Children 2 Education Stockholm School of Economics Eva Magdalena Andersson (Swedish pronunciation: [e?va ma?dalena and???n]) (born 23 January 1967) is a Swedish Social Democratic politician who has served as leader of the Social Democratic Party since 4 November 2021.[1] On 24 November 2021, the Swedish Riksdag elected her as Sweden's first female Prime Minister, thereby ending Sweden's status as the only Nordic country never to have elected a woman as head of government.[2][3] A few hours later, she resigned without taking office as her coalition collapsed after it failed to pass a budget and the Green Party refused to govern with the oppositional budget.[4] Contents 1 Biography 1.1 Early life 1.2 Education 2 Career 2.1 Adviser and civil servant 2.2 Minister for Finance 2.3 Leader of the Social Democratic Party 2.4 Prime Minister elect of Sweden (2021) 3 Other roles 4 Personal life 5 References Biography[edit] Early life[edit] Andersson is the only child of Göran Andersson (1936–2002), a lecturer in statistics at Uppsala University, and teacher Birgitta Andersson (née Grunell) (born 1939).[5] Andersson was an elite-level swimmer in her youth.[6][7] Education[edit] During her high school years, Andersson studied social sciences at the Cathedral School in Uppsala. She graduated in 1987 with top grades in all but one class.[8] After graduating from high school, Andersson moved to Stockholm to study at the Stockholm School of Economics,[9] where she graduated in 1992 with a master's degree in economics. She then worked as a doctoral student in economics at the Stockholm School of Economics in the years 1992–1995 but ended her studies in advance. In the autumn of 1994, she studied at the Institute of Advanced Studies in Vienna. In the spring of 1995, she studied at Harvard University.[10] Andersson joined the Social Democratic Youth League (SSU) in 1983, during her first year of secondary school.[11] In 1987, she was elected president of the Uppsala section of SSU.[12] Career[edit] Adviser and civil servant[edit] After completing her studies in economics, Andersson gained employment in the Prime Minister's Office as a political adviser to Göran Persson from 1996 to 1998, and later served as Director of Planning from 1998 to 2004. She then spent time in the civil service, working as Secretary of state in the Ministry of Finance from 2004 to 2006, before leaving to again become a political adviser, this time to Opposition Leader Mona Sahlin, from 2007 to 2009. She left this role when the Government nominated her for the role of Chief Director of the Swedish Tax Agency, a position she held until 2012. She resigned upon her adoption as a Social Democratic candidate ahead of the 2014 general election.[13] Minister for Finance[edit] Andersson with her first government budget (known as nådiga luntan) outside the Parliament on 23 October 2014 After the Social Democratic victory in the 2014 Swedish general election in which Andersson was elected as a member of the Riksdag, she was appointed as the Minister for Finance by new prime minister Stefan Löfven in his cabinet.[14] As a result of coalition negotiations, while Andersson had overall responsibility for the Finance Ministry, Per Bolund was given responsibility for the oversight of financial markets and consumer protection as the Minister for Financial Markets.[15] Andersson was reappointed as Finance Minister by Löfven following the 2018 election.[16] In 2020, members of the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC), the primary policy advisory committee of the Board of Governors of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), chose Andersson to serve as Chair of the Committee for a term of three years.[17] She became the first European in that role after more than a decade, as well as the first woman to hold that position.[18] In August 2021, Prime Minister Stefan Löfven announced he would resign as party leader at the Social Democratic Party Congress in November 2021.[19] Andersson was quickly regarded by many as the most likely candidate to succeed him, and on 29 September, the Social Democratic Party nominating committee announced that Andersson had been chosen as leader-designate ahead of the congress; should the designation be accepted by the Riksdag, Andersson would become leader and Sweden's first female Prime Minister.[20][21] Leader of the Social Democratic Party[edit] Andersson was elected Leader of the Social Democratic Party on 4 November 2021,[22] becoming the party's second female leader after Mona Sahlin.[23] On 10 November, Prime Minister Löfven formally resigned from office.[24] As part of the government formation process, the Speaker of the Riksdag held talks with all party leaders on 11 November and shortly after tasked Andersson with forming a government, giving her one week.[25] On 23 November 2021, it was announced that Andersson has reached an agreement with the Left Party to support her at the upcoming prime ministerial vote. With the Centre Party having previously agreed to support her, Andersson had the required number of MPs to become Sweden's next prime minister.[26] Prime Minister elect of Sweden (2021)[edit] On 24 November 2021, Andersson was elected as Sweden's new prime minister by the Riksdag.[3] At the time of her election, she would have assumed office formally on 26 November 2021.[27] Although she did not receive a majority of "yes" votes, she also did not receive a majority of "no" votes, which under the Riksdag's principle of negative parliamentarism was sufficient to elect her as prime minister.[3] Andersson is Sweden's first female head of government since universal suffrage was introduced in 1921.[28] A few hours after being elected, Andersson announced her decision to resign as Prime Minister after the Green Party refused to govern using the opposition's budget and left the coalition. Andersson's resignation was based on the convention that a Prime Minister should resign if a party leaves the governing coalition. She notified Speaker Andreas Norlén that she is interested in leading a social democratic one-party government.[29][30] Other roles[edit] Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), Ex-Officio Member of the Board of Governors[31] European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Ex-Officio Member of the Board of Governors[32] European Investment Bank (EIB), Ex-Officio Member of the Board of Governors (since 2014)[33] Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), World Bank Group, Ex-Officio Member of the Board of Governors[34] Nordic Investment Bank (NIB), Ex-Officio Chairwoman of the Board of Governors[35] World Bank, Ex-Officio Member of the Board of Governors[36] Policy Network, Member of the Board (2005–2009)[37] Personal life[edit] Andersson is married to Richard Friberg [sv], a professor in economics at the Stockholm School of Economics, since 1997, with whom she has two children.[38] She and her husband are avid outdoors people; they often go hiking, kayaking and mountaineering.[39] References[edit] ^ Dutt, Sujay (4 November 2021).

She graduated in 1987 with top grades in all but one class.[8] After graduating from high school, Andersson moved to Stockholm to study at the Stockholm School of Economics,[9] where she graduated in 1992 with a master's degree in economics. She then worked as a doctoral student in economics at the Stockholm School of Economics in the years 1992–1995 but ended her studies in advance. In the autumn of 1994, she studied at the Institute of Advanced Studies in Vienna. In the spring of 1995, she studied at Harvard University.[10] Andersson joined the Social Democratic Youth League (SSU) in 1983, during her first year of secondary school.[11] In 1987, she was elected president of the Uppsala section of SSU.[12] Career[edit] Adviser and civil servant[edit] After completing her studies in economics, Andersson gained employment in the Prime Minister's Office as a political adviser to Göran Persson from 1996 to 1998, and later served as Director of Planning from 1998 to 2004. She then spent time in the civil service, working as Secretary of state in the Ministry of Finance from 2004 to 2006, before leaving to again become a political adviser, this time to Opposition Leader Mona Sahlin, from 2007 to 2009. She left this role when the Government nominated her for the role of Chief Director of the Swedish Tax Agency, a position she held until 2012. She resigned upon her adoption as a Social Democratic candidate ahead of the 2014 general election.[13] Minister for Finance[edit] Andersson with her first government budget (known as nådiga luntan) outside the Parliament on 23 October 2014 After the Social Democratic victory in the 2014 Swedish general election in which Andersson was elected as a member of the Riksdag, she was appointed as the Minister for Finance by new prime minister Stefan Löfven in his cabinet.[14] As a result of coalition negotiations, while Andersson had overall responsibility for the Finance Ministry, Per Bolund was given responsibility for the oversight of financial markets and consumer protection as the Minister for Financial Markets.[15] Andersson was reappointed as Finance Minister by Löfven following the 2018 election.[16] In 2020, members of the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC), the primary policy advisory committee of the Board of Governors of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), chose Andersson to serve as Chair of the Committee for a term of three years.[17] She became the first European in that role after more than a decade, as well as the first woman to hold that position.[18] In August 2021, Prime Minister Stefan Löfven announced he would resign as party leader at the Social Democratic Party Congress in November 2021.[19] Andersson was quickly regarded by many as the most likely candidate to succeed him, and on 29 September, the Social Democratic Party nominating committee announced that Andersson had been chosen as leader-designate ahead of the congress; should the designation be accepted by the Riksdag, Andersson would become leader and Sweden's first female Prime Minister.[20][21] Leader of the Social Democratic Party[edit] Andersson was elected Leader of the Social Democratic Party on 4 November 2021,[22] becoming the party's second female leader after Mona Sahlin.[23] On 10 November, Prime Minister Löfven formally resigned from office.[24] As part of the government formation process, the Speaker of the Riksdag held talks with all party leaders on 11 November and shortly after tasked Andersson with forming a government, giving her one week.[25] On 23 November 2021, it was announced that Andersson has reached an agreement with the Left Party to support her at the upcoming prime ministerial vote. With the Centre Party having previously agreed to support her, Andersson had the required number of MPs to become Sweden's next prime minister.[26] Prime Minister elect of Sweden (2021)[edit] On 24 November 2021, Andersson was elected as Sweden's new prime minister by the Riksdag.[3] At the time of her election, she would have assumed office formally on 26 November 2021.[27] Although she did not receive a majority of "yes" votes, she also did not receive a majority of "no" votes, which under the Riksdag's principle of negative parliamentarism was sufficient to elect her as prime minister.[3] Andersson is Sweden's first female head of government since universal suffrage was introduced in 1921.[28] A few hours after being elected, Andersson announced her decision to resign as Prime Minister after the Green Party refused to govern using the opposition's budget and left the coalition. Andersson's resignation was based on the convention that a Prime Minister should resign if a party leaves the governing coalition. She notified Speaker Andreas Norlén that she is interested in leading a social democratic one-party government.[29][30] Other roles[edit] Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), Ex-Officio Member of the Board of Governors[31] European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Ex-Officio Member of the Board of Governors[32] European Investment Bank (EIB), Ex-Officio Member of the Board of Governors (since 2014)[33] Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), World Bank Group, Ex-Officio Member of the Board of Governors[34] Nordic Investment Bank (NIB), Ex-Officio Chairwoman of the Board of Governors[35] World Bank, Ex-Officio Member of the Board of Governors[36] Policy Network, Member of the Board (2005–2009)[37] Personal life[edit] Since 1997, Andersson has been married to Richard Friberg [sv], a professor in economics at the Stockholm School of Economics; they have two children.[38] She and her husband are avid outdoors people; they often go hiking, kayaking and mountaineering.[39] References[edit] ^ Dutt, Sujay (4 November 2021).

Children 2 Education Stockholm School of Economics Eva Magdalena Andersson (Swedish pronunciation: [e?va ma?dalena and???n]) (born 23 January 1967) is a Swedish Social Democratic politician who has served as leader of the Social Democratic Party since 4 November 2021.[1] On 24 November 2021, the Swedish Riksdag elected her as Sweden's first female Prime Minister, thereby ending Sweden's status as the only Nordic country never to have elected a woman as head of government.[2][3] A few hours later, she resigned without taking office as her coalition collapsed after it failed to pass a budget and the Green Party refused to govern with the oppositional budget.[4] Contents 1 Biography 1.1 Early life 1.2 Education 2 Career 2.1 Adviser and civil servant 2.2 Minister for Finance 2.3 Leader of the Social Democratic Party 2.4 Prime Minister elect of Sweden (2021) 3 Other roles 4 Personal life 5 References Biography[edit] Early life[edit] Andersson is the only child of Göran Andersson (1936–2002), a lecturer in statistics at Uppsala University, and teacher Birgitta Andersson (née Grunell) (born 1939).[5] Andersson was an elite-level swimmer in her youth.[6][7] Education[edit] During her high school years, Andersson studied social sciences at the Cathedral School in Uppsala. She graduated in 1987 with top grades in all but one class.[8] After graduating from high school, Andersson moved to Stockholm to study at the Stockholm School of Economics,[9] where she graduated in 1992 with a master's degree in economics. She then worked as a doctoral student in economics at the Stockholm School of Economics in the years 1992–1995 but ended her studies in advance. In the autumn of 1994, she studied at the Institute of Advanced Studies in Vienna. In the spring of 1995, she studied at Harvard University.[10] Andersson joined the Social Democratic Youth League (SSU) in 1983, during her first year of secondary school.[11] In 1987, she was elected president of the Uppsala section of SSU.[12] Career[edit] Adviser and civil servant[edit] After completing her studies in economics, Andersson gained employment in the Prime Minister's Office as a political adviser to Göran Persson from 1996 to 1998, and later served as Director of Planning from 1998 to 2004. She then spent time in the civil service, working as Secretary of state in the Ministry of Finance from 2004 to 2006, before leaving to again become a political adviser, this time to Opposition Leader Mona Sahlin, from 2007 to 2009. She left this role when the Government nominated her for the role of Chief Director of the Swedish Tax Agency, a position she held until 2012. She resigned upon her adoption as a Social Democratic candidate ahead of the 2014 general election.[13] Minister for Finance[edit] Andersson with her first government budget (known as nådiga luntan) outside the Parliament on 23 October 2014 After the Social Democratic victory in the 2014 Swedish general election in which Andersson was elected as a member of the Riksdag, she was appointed as the Minister for Finance by new prime minister Stefan Löfven in his cabinet.[14] As a result of coalition negotiations, while Andersson had overall responsibility for the Finance Ministry, Per Bolund was given responsibility for the oversight of financial markets and consumer protection as the Minister for Financial Markets.[15] Andersson was reappointed as Finance Minister by Löfven following the 2018 election.[16] In 2020, members of the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC), the primary policy advisory committee of the Board of Governors of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), chose Andersson to serve as Chair of the Committee for a term of three years.[17] She became the first European in that role after more than a decade, as well as the first woman to hold that position.[18] In August 2021, Prime Minister Stefan Löfven announced he would resign as party leader at the Social Democratic Party Congress in November 2021.[19] Andersson was quickly regarded by many as the most likely candidate to succeed him, and on 29 September, the Social Democratic Party nominating committee announced that Andersson had been chosen as leader-designate ahead of the congress; should the designation be accepted by the Riksdag, Andersson would become leader and Sweden's first female Prime Minister.[20][21] Leader of the Social Democratic Party[edit] Andersson was elected Leader of the Social Democratic Party on 4 November 2021,[22] becoming the party's second female leader after Mona Sahlin.[23] On 10 November, Prime Minister Löfven formally resigned from office.[24] As part of the government formation process, the Speaker of the Riksdag held talks with all party leaders on 11 November and shortly after tasked Andersson with forming a government, giving her one week.[25] On 23 November 2021, it was announced that Andersson has reached an agreement with the Left Party to support her at the upcoming prime ministerial vote. With the Centre Party having previously agreed to support her, Andersson had the required number of MPs to become Sweden's next prime minister.[26] Prime Minister elect of Sweden (2021)[edit] On 24 November 2021, Andersson was elected as Sweden's new prime minister by the Riksdag.[3] At the time of her election, she would have assumed office formally on 26 November 2021.[27] Although she did not receive a majority of "yes" votes, she also did not receive a majority of "no" votes, which under the Riksdag's principle of negative parliamentarism was sufficient to elect her as prime minister.[3] Andersson is Sweden's first female head of government since universal suffrage was introduced in 1921.[28] A few hours after being elected, Andersson announced her decision to resign as Prime Minister after the Green Party refused to govern using the opposition's budget and left the coalition. Andersson's resignation was based on the convention that a Prime Minister should resign if a party leaves the governing coalition. She notified Speaker Andreas Norlén that she would be interested in leading a Social Democratic single-party government.[29][30] Other roles[edit] Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), Ex-Officio Member of the Board of Governors[31] European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Ex-Officio Member of the Board of Governors[32] European Investment Bank (EIB), Ex-Officio Member of the Board of Governors (since 2014)[33] Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), World Bank Group, Ex-Officio Member of the Board of Governors[34] Nordic Investment Bank (NIB), Ex-Officio Chairwoman of the Board of Governors[35] World Bank, Ex-Officio Member of the Board of Governors[36] Policy Network, Member of the Board (2005–2009)[37] Personal life[edit] Since 1997, Andersson has been married to Richard Friberg [sv], a professor in economics at the Stockholm School of Economics; they have two children.[38] She and her husband are avid outdoors people; they often go hiking, kayaking and mountaineering.[39] References[edit] ^ Dutt, Sujay (4 November 2021).

Children 2 Education Stockholm School of Economics Eva Magdalena Andersson (Swedish pronunciation: [e?va ma?dalena and???n]) (born 23 January 1967) is a Swedish Social Democratic politician who has served as leader of the Social Democratic Party since 4 November 2021.[1] On 24 November 2021, the Swedish Riksdag elected her as Sweden's first female Prime Minister, thereby ending Sweden's status as the only Nordic country never to have elected a woman as head of government.[2][3] A few hours later, she resigned without taking office as her coalition collapsed after it failed to pass a budget and the Green Party refused to govern with the oppositional budget.[4] Contents 1 Biography 1.1 Early life 1.2 Education 2 Career 2.1 Adviser and civil servant 2.2 Minister for Finance 2.3 Leader of the Social Democratic Party 2.4 Prime Minister elect of Sweden (2021) 3 Other roles 4 Personal life 5 References Biography[edit] Early life[edit] Andersson is the only child of Göran Andersson (1936–2002), a lecturer in statistics at Uppsala University, and teacher Birgitta Andersson (née Grunell) (born 1939).[5] Andersson was an elite-level swimmer in her youth.[6][7] Education[edit] During her high school years, Andersson studied social sciences at the Cathedral School in Uppsala. She graduated in 1987 with top grades in all but one class.[8] After graduating from high school, Andersson moved to Stockholm to study at the Stockholm School of Economics,[9] where she graduated in 1992 with a master's degree in economics. She then worked as a doctoral student in economics at the Stockholm School of Economics in the years 1992–1995 but ended her studies in advance. In the autumn of 1994, she studied at the Institute of Advanced Studies in Vienna. In the spring of 1995, she studied at Harvard University.[10] Andersson joined the Social Democratic Youth League (SSU) in 1983, during her first year of secondary school.[11] In 1987, she was elected president of the Uppsala section of SSU.[12] Career[edit] Adviser and civil servant[edit] After completing her studies in economics, Andersson gained employment in the Prime Minister's Office as a political adviser to Göran Persson from 1996 to 1998, and later served as Director of Planning from 1998 to 2004. She then spent time in the civil service, working as Secretary of state in the Ministry of Finance from 2004 to 2006, before leaving to again become a political adviser, this time to Opposition Leader Mona Sahlin, from 2007 to 2009. She left this role when the Government nominated her for the role of Chief Director of the Swedish Tax Agency, a position she held until 2012. She resigned upon her adoption as a Social Democratic candidate ahead of the 2014 general election.[13] Minister for Finance[edit] Andersson with her first government budget (known as nådiga luntan) outside the Parliament on 23 October 2014 After the Social Democratic victory in the 2014 Swedish general election in which Andersson was elected as a member of the Riksdag, she was appointed as the Minister for Finance by new prime minister Stefan Löfven in his cabinet.[14] As a result of coalition negotiations, while Andersson had overall responsibility for the Finance Ministry, Per Bolund was given responsibility for the oversight of financial markets and consumer protection as the Minister for Financial Markets.[15] Andersson was reappointed as Finance Minister by Löfven following the 2018 election.[16] In 2020, members of the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC), the primary policy advisory committee of the Board of Governors of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), chose Andersson to serve as Chair of the Committee for a term of three years.[17] She became the first European in that role after more than a decade, as well as the first woman to hold that position.[18] In August 2021, Prime Minister Stefan Löfven announced he would resign as party leader at the Social Democratic Party Congress in November 2021.[19] Andersson was quickly regarded by many as the most likely candidate to succeed him, and on 29 September, the Social Democratic Party nominating committee announced that Andersson had been chosen as leader-designate ahead of the congress; should the designation be accepted by the Riksdag, Andersson would become leader and Sweden's first female Prime Minister.[20][21] Leader of the Social Democratic Party[edit] Andersson was elected Leader of the Social Democratic Party on 4 November 2021,[22] becoming the party's second female leader after Mona Sahlin.[23] On 10 November, Prime Minister Löfven formally resigned from office.[24] As part of the government formation process, the Speaker of the Riksdag held talks with all party leaders on 11 November and shortly after tasked Andersson with forming a government, giving her one week.[25] On 23 November 2021, it was announced that Andersson has reached an agreement with the Left Party to support her at the upcoming prime ministerial vote. With the Centre Party having previously agreed to support her, Andersson had the required number of MPs to become Sweden's next prime minister.[26] Prime Minister elect of Sweden (2021)[edit] On 24 November 2021, Andersson was elected as Sweden's new prime minister by the Riksdag.[3] At the time of her election, she would have assumed office formally on 26 November 2021.[27] Although she did not receive a majority of "yes" votes, a majority did not vote against her due to abstentions. Under the Riksdag's principle of negative parliamentarism, this was sufficient to elect her as prime minister.[3] Andersson is Sweden's first female head of government since universal suffrage was introduced in 1921.[28] A few hours after Andersson's election, her budget was defeated in the Riksdag. The opposition budget passed instead. Since the opposition budget was drafted with the support of the right-wing populist Sweden Democrats, Green Party pulled out of the coalition rather than be bound to govern under it, leading Andersson to resign. This was based on the convention that a Prime Minister should resign if a party leaves the governing coalition. She notified Speaker Andreas Norlén that she would be interested in leading a Social Democratic single-party government.[29][30] According to the BBC, the Greens promised to give confidence and supply to a one-party Social Democratic minority government.[3] Other roles[edit] Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), Ex-Officio Member of the Board of Governors[31] European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Ex-Officio Member of the Board of Governors[32] European Investment Bank (EIB), Ex-Officio Member of the Board of Governors (since 2014)[33] Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), World Bank Group, Ex-Officio Member of the Board of Governors[34] Nordic Investment Bank (NIB), Ex-Officio Chairwoman of the Board of Governors[35] World Bank, Ex-Officio Member of the Board of Governors[36] Policy Network, Member of the Board (2005–2009)[37] Personal life[edit] Since 1997, Andersson has been married to Richard Friberg [sv], a professor in economics at the Stockholm School of Economics; they have two children.[38] She and her husband are avid outdoors people; they often go hiking, kayaking and mountaineering.[39] References[edit] ^ Dutt, Sujay (4 November 2021).

Children 2 Education Stockholm School of Economics Eva Magdalena Andersson (Swedish pronunciation: [e?va ma?dalena and???n]) (born 23 January 1967) is a Swedish Social Democratic politician who has served as leader of the Social Democratic Party since 4 November 2021.[1] On 24 November 2021, the Swedish Riksdag elected her as Sweden's first female Prime Minister, thereby ending Sweden's status as the only Nordic country never to have elected a woman as head of government.[2][3] A few hours later, she resigned without taking office as her coalition collapsed after it failed to pass a budget and the Green Party refused to govern with the oppositional budget.[4] Contents 1 Biography 1.1 Early life 1.2 Education 2 Career 2.1 Adviser and civil servant 2.2 Minister for Finance 2.3 Leader of the Social Democratic Party 2.4 Prime Minister elect of Sweden (2021) 3 Other roles 4 Personal life 5 References Biography[edit] Early life[edit] Andersson is the only child of Göran Andersson (1936–2002), a lecturer in statistics at Uppsala University, and teacher Birgitta Andersson (née Grunell) (born 1939).[5] Andersson was an elite-level swimmer in her youth.[6][7] Education[edit] During her high school years, Andersson studied social sciences at the Cathedral School in Uppsala. She graduated in 1987 with top grades in all but one class.[8] After graduating from high school, Andersson moved to Stockholm to study at the Stockholm School of Economics,[9] where she graduated in 1992 with a master's degree in economics. She then worked as a doctoral student in economics at the Stockholm School of Economics in the years 1992–1995 but ended her studies in advance. In the autumn of 1994, she studied at the Institute of Advanced Studies in Vienna. In the spring of 1995, she studied at Harvard University.[10] Andersson joined the Social Democratic Youth League (SSU) in 1983, during her first year of secondary school.[11] In 1987, she was elected president of the Uppsala section of SSU.[12] Career[edit] Adviser and civil servant[edit] After completing her studies in economics, Andersson gained employment in the Prime Minister's Office as a political adviser to Göran Persson from 1996 to 1998, and later served as Director of Planning from 1998 to 2004. She then spent time in the civil service, working as Secretary of state in the Ministry of Finance from 2004 to 2006, before leaving to again become a political adviser, this time to Opposition Leader Mona Sahlin, from 2007 to 2009. She left this role when the Government nominated her for the role of Chief Director of the Swedish Tax Agency, a position she held until 2012. She resigned upon her adoption as a Social Democratic candidate ahead of the 2014 general election.[13] Minister for Finance[edit] Andersson with her first government budget (known as nådiga luntan) outside the Parliament on 23 October 2014 After the Social Democratic victory in the 2014 Swedish general election in which Andersson was elected as a member of the Riksdag, she was appointed as the Minister for Finance by new prime minister Stefan Löfven in his cabinet.[14] As a result of coalition negotiations, while Andersson had overall responsibility for the Finance Ministry, Per Bolund was given responsibility for the oversight of financial markets and consumer protection as the Minister for Financial Markets.[15] Andersson was reappointed as Finance Minister by Löfven following the 2018 election.[16] In 2020, members of the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC), the primary policy advisory committee of the Board of Governors of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), chose Andersson to serve as Chair of the Committee for a term of three years.[17] She became the first European in that role after more than a decade, as well as the first woman to hold that position.[18] In August 2021, Prime Minister Stefan Löfven announced he would resign as party leader at the Social Democratic Party Congress in November 2021.[19] Andersson was quickly regarded by many as the most likely candidate to succeed him, and on 29 September, the Social Democratic Party nominating committee announced that Andersson had been chosen as leader-designate ahead of the congress; should the designation be accepted by the Riksdag, Andersson would become leader and Sweden's first female Prime Minister.[20][21] Leader of the Social Democratic Party[edit] Andersson was elected Leader of the Social Democratic Party on 4 November 2021,[22] becoming the party's second female leader after Mona Sahlin.[23] On 10 November, Prime Minister Löfven formally resigned from office.[24] As part of the government formation process, the Speaker of the Riksdag held talks with all party leaders on 11 November and shortly after tasked Andersson with forming a government, giving her one week.[25] On 23 November 2021, it was announced that Andersson has reached an agreement with the Left Party to support her at the upcoming prime ministerial vote. With the Centre Party having previously agreed to support her, Andersson had the required number of MPs to become Sweden's next prime minister.[26] Prime Minister elect of Sweden (2021)[edit] On 24 November 2021, Andersson was elected as Sweden's new prime minister by the Riksdag.[3] At the time of her election, she would have assumed office formally on 26 November 2021.[27] Although she did not receive a majority of "yes" votes, a majority did not vote against her due to abstentions. Under the Riksdag's principle of negative parliamentarism, this was sufficient to elect her as prime minister.[3] Andersson would have been Sweden's first female head of government since universal suffrage was introduced in 1921.[28] A few hours after Andersson's election, her budget was defeated in the Riksdag. The opposition budget passed instead. Since the opposition budget was drafted with the support of the right-wing populist Sweden Democrats, Green Party pulled out of the coalition rather than be bound to govern under it, leading Andersson to resign. This was based on the convention that a Prime Minister should resign if a party leaves the governing coalition. She notified Speaker Andreas Norlén that she would be interested in leading a Social Democratic single-party government.[29][30] According to the BBC, the Greens promised to give confidence and supply to a one-party Social Democratic minority government.[3] Other roles[edit] Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), Ex-Officio Member of the Board of Governors[31] European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Ex-Officio Member of the Board of Governors[32] European Investment Bank (EIB), Ex-Officio Member of the Board of Governors (since 2014)[33] Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), World Bank Group, Ex-Officio Member of the Board of Governors[34] Nordic Investment Bank (NIB), Ex-Officio Chairwoman of the Board of Governors[35] World Bank, Ex-Officio Member of the Board of Governors[36] Policy Network, Member of the Board (2005–2009)[37] Personal life[edit] Since 1997, Andersson has been married to Richard Friberg [sv], a professor in economics at the Stockholm School of Economics; they have two children.[38] She and her husband are avid outdoors people; they often go hiking, kayaking and mountaineering.[39] References[edit] ^ Dutt, Sujay (4 November 2021).

Children 2 Education Stockholm School of Economics Eva Magdalena Andersson (Swedish pronunciation: [e?va ma?dalena and???n]) (born 23 January 1967) is a Swedish Social Democratic politician who has served as leader of the Social Democratic Party since 4 November 2021.[1] On 24 November 2021, the Swedish Riksdag elected her as Sweden's first female Prime Minister, thereby ending Sweden's status as the only Nordic country never to have elected a woman as head of government.[2][3] A few hours later, she resigned without taking office as her coalition collapsed after it failed to pass a budget and the Green Party refused to govern with the oppositional budget.[4] Contents 1 Biography 1.1 Early life 1.2 Education 2 Career 2.1 Adviser and civil servant 2.2 Minister for Finance 2.3 Leader of the Social Democratic Party 2.4 Prime Minister elect of Sweden (2021) 3 Other roles 4 Personal life 5 References Biography[edit] Early life[edit] Andersson is the only child of Göran Andersson (1936–2002), a lecturer in statistics at Uppsala University, and teacher Birgitta Andersson (née Grunell) (born 1939).[5] Andersson was an elite-level swimmer in her youth.[6][7] Education[edit] During her high school years, Andersson studied social sciences at the Cathedral School in Uppsala. She graduated in 1987 with top grades in all but one class.[8] After graduating from high school, Andersson moved to Stockholm to study at the Stockholm School of Economics,[9] where she graduated in 1992 with a master's degree in economics. She then worked as a doctoral student in economics at the Stockholm School of Economics in the years 1992–1995 but ended her studies in advance. In the autumn of 1994, she studied at the Institute of Advanced Studies in Vienna. In the spring of 1995, she studied at Harvard University.[10] Andersson joined the Social Democratic Youth League (SSU) in 1983, during her first year of secondary school.[11] In 1987, she was elected president of the Uppsala section of SSU.[12] Career[edit] Adviser and civil servant[edit] After completing her studies in economics, Andersson gained employment in the Prime Minister's Office as a political adviser to Göran Persson from 1996 to 1998, and later served as Director of Planning from 1998 to 2004. She then spent time in the civil service, working as Secretary of state in the Ministry of Finance from 2004 to 2006, before leaving to again become a political adviser, this time to Opposition Leader Mona Sahlin, from 2007 to 2009. She left this role when the Government nominated her for the role of Chief Director of the Swedish Tax Agency, a position she held until 2012. She resigned upon her adoption as a Social Democratic candidate ahead of the 2014 general election.[13] Minister for Finance[edit] Andersson with her first government budget (known as nådiga luntan) outside the Parliament on 23 October 2014 After the Social Democratic victory in the 2014 Swedish general election in which Andersson was elected as a member of the Riksdag, she was appointed as the Minister for Finance by new prime minister Stefan Löfven in his cabinet.[14] As a result of coalition negotiations, while Andersson had overall responsibility for the Finance Ministry, Per Bolund was given responsibility for the oversight of financial markets and consumer protection as the Minister for Financial Markets.[15] Andersson was reappointed as Finance Minister by Löfven following the 2018 election.[16] In 2020, members of the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC), the primary policy advisory committee of the Board of Governors of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), chose Andersson to serve as Chair of the Committee for a term of three years.[17] She became the first European in that role after more than a decade, as well as the first woman to hold that position.[18] In August 2021, Prime Minister Stefan Löfven announced he would resign as party leader at the Social Democratic Party Congress in November 2021.[19] Andersson was quickly regarded by many as the most likely candidate to succeed him, and on 29 September, the Social Democratic Party nominating committee announced that Andersson had been chosen as leader-designate ahead of the congress; should the designation be accepted by the Riksdag, Andersson would become leader and Sweden's first female Prime Minister.[20][21] Leader of the Social Democratic Party[edit] Andersson was elected Leader of the Social Democratic Party on 4 November 2021,[22] becoming the party's second female leader after Mona Sahlin.[23] On 10 November, Prime Minister Löfven formally resigned from office.[24] As part of the government formation process, the Speaker of the Riksdag held talks with all party leaders on 11 November and shortly after tasked Andersson with forming a government, giving her one week.[25] On 23 November 2021, it was announced that Andersson has reached an agreement with the Left Party to support her at the upcoming prime ministerial vote. With the Centre Party having previously agreed to support her, Andersson had the required number of MPs to become Sweden's next prime minister.[26] Prime Minister elect of Sweden (2021)[edit] On 24 November 2021, Andersson was elected as Sweden's new prime minister by the Riksdag.[3] At the time of her election, she would have assumed office formally on 26 November 2021.[27] Although she did not receive a majority of "yes" votes, a majority did not vote against her due to abstentions. Under the Riksdag's principle of negative parliamentarism, this was sufficient to elect her as prime minister.[3] Andersson would have been Sweden's first female head of government since universal suffrage was introduced in 1921.[28] A few hours after Andersson's election, her budget was defeated in the Riksdag. The opposition budget passed instead. Since the opposition budget was drafted with the support of the right-wing populist Sweden Democrats, Green Party pulled out of the coalition rather than be bound to govern under it, leading Andersson to resign. This was based on the convention that a Prime Minister should resign if a party leaves the governing coalition. She notified Speaker Andreas Norlén that she would be interested in leading a Social Democratic single-party government.[29][30] According to the BBC, the Greens promised to give confidence and supply to a one-party Social Democratic minority government.[3] Other roles[edit] Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), Ex-Officio Member of the Board of Governors[31] European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Ex-Officio Member of the Board of Governors[32] European Investment Bank (EIB), Ex-Officio Member of the Board of Governors (since 2014)[33] Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), World Bank Group, Ex-Officio Member of the Board of Governors[34] Nordic Investment Bank (NIB), Ex-Officio Chairwoman of the Board of Governors[35] World Bank, Ex-Officio Member of the Board of Governors[36] Policy Network, Member of the Board (2005–2009)[37] Personal life[edit] Since 1997, Andersson has been married to Richard Friberg [sv], a professor in economics at the Stockholm School of Economics; they have two children.[38] She and her husband are avid outdoors people; they often go hiking, kayaking and mountaineering.[39] References[edit] ^ Dutt, Sujay (4 November 2021).
