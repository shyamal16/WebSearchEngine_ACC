The station offered her a 15-minute spot on its Saturday night program.[7] Before performing with her husband, Maphis was featured in a female quartet, a western group called The Saddle Sweethearts, who often played the same bill as Gene Autry[1] and Roy Acuff.[8][9][10] After performing with Saddle Sweethearts, she worked briefly for her father as a bookkeeper. She learned that Mother Maybelle and The Carter Sisters were leaving the Old Dominion Barn Dance and were looking for singers. She met her future husband Joe there.[1] She and her husband would later be called "Mr. and Mrs. Country Music".[2] A producer suggested the name "Rose of the Mountains" for her on her debut performance on a Hagerstown radio station, as she had a rose in her hair and was singing "Carry Me Back to the Mountains".[1] Around the 1950s, Maphis and her husband were cast members of the television show Town Hall Party on KTTV in Los Angeles.[11] The Maphises were best known for the self-penned honky-tonk standard "Dim Lights, Thick Smoke (And Loud, Loud Music)", which was originally recorded by Flatt and Scruggs.[2] Post-entertainment career[edit] After the death of her husband, she worked as a seamstress at Opryland theme park designing for such stars as Brenda Lee and Barbara Mandrell.[7] In her later years, and no longer well-known as a major star, she worked voluntarily as a greeter at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum,[1] sharing stories about the genre's legends. Maphis's guitar is on display, next to that of her husband's double-neck Mosrite and sheet music for their recording "Dim Lights", in a montage called The Bakersfield Exhibit.[1] She died of kidney failure on October 26, 2021, in Nashville, Tennessee, at age 98. She had 3 children, including Jody Maphis who has performed with such stars as Johnny Cash.[8][3] Discography[edit] Singles[edit] Columbia Records[edit] 1955: "Honky Tonk Down Town / The Parting of the Way"[12] 1955 "I'm Willin' To Try / Let's Pull Together"[13] 1959: "Fire On the Strings / I Love You Deeply" (A-side by Joe Maphis) Mosrite Records[edit] 1966: "Send Me Your Love A.P.O. / Write Him A Letter"[14] 1967: "Tunin' Up For The Blues / A Lifetime of Love" 1967: "Country Girl Courtship / Pickin' and Guitin'"[15] Starday Records[edit] 1964: "Hoot'n Annie / Remember I'm Just As Close As the Phone"[16] 1965: "Hot Time in Nashville / I've Got To Take You Home"[17] 1965: "Your Little Black Book / Don't Pass Me By"[18] 1966: "Ridin' Down Ole 99 / Turn On The Bright Lights"[19] Chart Records[edit] 1969: "Gee Aren't We Lucky / Guitar Happy" 1970: "Run That By Me One More Time / I Don't Care" 1971: "Slippin', Pickin', Fiddlin' / If I'm Gonna Have Your Lovin'" Albums[edit] 1961: Rose Lee Maphis 1962: Rose Lee & Joe Maphis (with Joe Maphis and the Blue Ridge Mountain Boys) 1964: Mr. and Mrs. Country Music (with Joe Maphis) 1964: Hootenanny Star 1978: Dim Lights, Thick Smoke (with Joe Maphis) 1979: Boogie Woogie Flattop Guitar Pickin' Man (with Joe Maphis) 1980: Honky Tonk Cowboy (with Joe Maphis)[4] References[edit] ^ a b c d e f g Bliss, Jessica (January 9, 2015).
