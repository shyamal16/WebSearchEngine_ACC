https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%A9o_Lef%C3%A8vre Géo Lefèvre - Wikipedia Géo Lefèvre From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Géo Lefèvre (1877–1961) was a French sports journalist and the originator of the idea for the Tour de France. He suggested the idea for the Tour at a meeting with Henri Desgrange, editor of the daily newspaper L'Auto as a way to boost circulation. Desgrange recruited Lefèvre from the rival daily sports paper, Le Vélo, to work as his rugby and cycling correspondent. Lefèvre played both sports but was keener on cycling. When L'Auto 's circulation didn't match the hopes of its backers, Lefèvre was the youngest at a crisis conference held on the first floor of L'Auto's office in the rue Faubourg Montmartre in Paris. He said in subsequent interviews that he suggested a six-day race round France only because he could think of nothing else to say.[1] Desgrange said: "As I understand it, petit Géo, you are suggesting a Tour de France". The name had been used before, particularly in car racing, as the Tour de France Automobile was first held in 1899, but it was the first time it had been used in cycling. Desgrange took Lefèvre for lunch and the pair discussed the idea over coffee. Only when the newspaper's accountant, Victor Goddet, said he would put the company's funds into the scheme did Desgrange accept the idea. He didn't believe it so whole-heartedly, though, because he stayed away from the first Tour in 1903 and appointed Lefèvre director of the course and judge at both the start and finish, following the race by train, missing the finish in Lyon. Géo Lefèvre also played a key role in the early days of the sport of cyclo-cross.[2] References[edit] ^ L'Équipe, France, 8 July 2003 ^ cyclingnews.com, "Who got their tyres crossed?", 9 November 2006 v t e Tour de France By year 1903 1904 1905 1906 1907 1908 1909 1910 1911 1912 1913 1914 1915 1916 1917 1918 1919 1920 1921 1922 1923 1924 1925 1926 1927 1928 1929 1930 1931 1932 1933 1934 1935 1936 1937 1938 1939 1940 · 1941 · 1942 · 1943 · 1944 · 1945 · 1946 1947 1948 1949 1950 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966 1967 1968 1969 1970 1971 1972 1973 1974 1975 1976 1977 1978 1979 1980 1981 1982 1983 1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Classifications ("Jerseys") Current General (maillot jaune) Points (maillot vert) Mountains (maillot à pois) Young rider (maillot blanc) Team (classement d'équipes) Combativity (prix de combativité) Former  Combination (maillot du combiné)  Intermediate sprints (maillot rouge) Directors 1903–1935: Henri Desgrange 1936–1961: Jacques Goddet 1962–1986: Jacques Goddet and Félix Lévitan 1987: Jean-François Naquet-Radiguet 1988: Xavier Louy 1989–2006: Jean-Marie Leblanc 2007–present: Christian Prudhomme Finish locations 1903–1967: Parc des Princes 1968–1974: Vélodrome de Vincennes 1975–present: Champs-Élysées final stage Lists General classification winners Secondary classification winners Grands Départs Records and statistics Mountain passes and hills Highest points reached Additional topics During World War II Yellow jersey statistics Lanterne rouge Doping Hors catégorie Souvenir Jacques Goddet Souvenir Henri Desgrange Related articles Émilien Amaury Amaury Sport Organisation Pierre Dumas Géo Lefèvre Didi Senft La Course by Le Tour de France L'Étape du Tour Grand Tour Authority control General ISNI 1 VIAF 1 WorldCat National libraries France (data) Other SUDOC (France) 1 Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Géo_Lefèvre&oldid=1012929706" Categories: 1887 births 1961 deaths French sports journalists Tour de France journalists Cycling journalists French male non-fiction writers 20th-century French male writers Hidden categories: Use dmy dates from November 2019 Articles with ISNI identifiers Articles with VIAF identifiers Articles with BNF identifiers Articles with SUDOC identifiers Articles with WORLDCATID identifiers Place of birth missing Navigation menu Personal tools Not logged in Talk Contributions Create account Log in Namespaces Article Talk Variants expanded collapsed Views Read Edit View history More expanded collapsed Search Navigation Main page Contents Current events Random article About Wikipedia Contact us Donate Contribute Help Learn to edit Community portal Recent changes Upload file Tools What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Permanent link Page information Cite this page Wikidata item Print/export Download as PDF Printable version Languages Dansk Français ????
