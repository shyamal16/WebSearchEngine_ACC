However, I am putting this here because there is a larger community here. The question here is: Which article title do I use for attribution when the article was translated/copied before the title page (e.g. translations from when Climate change was titled Global warming)? I just thought I'd want to clear things up. Thanks, Caehlla2357 (talk) 03:00, 15 November 2021 (UTC) @Caehlla2357: Hi there! The guidelines and policies at tlwiki may be very different from those here at enwiki. I suggest you ask at the tlwiki Help desk, or at the talk page of the article in question. Good luck! GoingBatty (talk) 03:15, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Ah, yes. Of course. But as a general guideline (for future reference here at English Wikipedia), what is it? Thanks, Caehlla2357 (talk) 03:17, 15 November 2021 (UTC) When I do this, I usually use the current page title. I think that is consistent with the advice at WP:RIA, which gives a sample edit summary of NOTE: The previous edit as of 22:31, October 14, 2015?, copied content from the Wikipedia page at [[Exact name of page copied from]]; see its history for attribution. – so for example, directing people to the history of Climate change to see the original contributors of the copied content. The history of the article will also contain a record of the page move. DanCherek (talk) 03:31, 15 November 2021 (UTC) What I had done is mention both the current and the former name. But I think you may be right. Thanks, Caehlla2357 (talk) 14:55, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Fixing a bug in a template[edit] I'm looking at this page: Truth_in_Video_Game_Rating_Act The page currently says: "Enacted by 109th congress" The box that's filled out says: "Introduced by=109th" These are two substantially different things and they need to line up. I don't generally need nor want permissions to edit templates, so how and where can I ask for this to be fixed? -- Bob drobbs (talk) 03:03, 15 November 2021 (UTC) @Bob drobbs: You may wish to provide your input at Template talk:Infobox U.S. legislation#Enacted in proposed legislation. Hope this is what you were looking for, and happy editing! GoingBatty (talk) 03:13, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks!

We are a new rock band called: ESQ — Preceding unsigned comment added by 2600:1700:9584:8600:5164:E05E:EBC5:4582 (talk) 04:57, 15 November 2021 (UTC) By being something of more significance than 'a new rock band': See Wikipedia:Notability (music). Get written about enough by relevant secondary sources, and somebody (not you: see WP:COI) will probably start an article. Meanwhile, I'd concentrate on making music people will be interested in, rather than worrying about the lack of an article here. AndyTheGrump (talk) 05:04, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Please see WP:AMOUNT. I hope to see a page about you here in the future when you become notable. -Arch dude (talk) 06:02, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Become well-known enough that major music journalists start writing about you.

Joseph2302 (talk) 17:27, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Template transclusion?[edit] Hello, I copy-pasted Template:Xxxx-larger block from Wikisource along with its documentation. When I added the documentation for it, it created a documentation page for smaller block template. Perhaps it is because of the "template tranclusion" line in it. I don't know what transclusion is. Can anyone please check and tell if I did it the right way or not. Lightbluerain? (Talk | contribs) 17:46, 15 November 2021 (UTC) @Lightbluerain: The reason is that Wikisource:Template:Xxxx-larger block uses the same documentation page as Wikisource:Template:smaller block. I have moved the en.wp documentation to Template:xxxx-larger block/doc. Also, please remember to provide proper attribution when you copy CC-BY-SA–licensed content in the future. Rummskartoffel 18:38, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Sure. Thanks. Lightbluerain? (Talk | contribs) 10:00, 16 November 2021 (UTC) hello people[edit] How are you all doing?

Dhaneesh ? Ram 03:46, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Hello, Ram Dhaneesh. I too edit with mobile devices, but I use the fully functional desktop site, which works just fine on current mobile devices such as smartphones. Just scroll to the very bottom of any page in mobile view, and you will see a link to switch to the desktop site on your mobile device. I have written an essay that you may find useful, User:Cullen328/Smartphone editing. Cullen328 Let's discuss it 03:55, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks @Cullen328: to have a concern on my question. I too tried desktop to editing option, it is doing well. My problem is not on desktop version, is there any issues on visual editing option in Wikipedia. Because most of the time I used visual editing option, that is my request. Even after updated my device/Chrome/Google, it doesn't work properly. Thank you! Dhaneesh ?

It's possible someone else on the IP address you're using has been vandalising Wikipedia (if you're in a public place, then many people would share the same IP address). Joseph2302 (talk) 11:15, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Identifying opinion pieces[edit] I know opinion pieces are not reliable. I thought only those which are mentioned as opinion pieces as this article is an opinion piece, but administrator Ohnoitsjamie removed this article as an opinion piece which was not mentioned by the website as an opinion piece. So, which should be seen as an opinion piece, other than those which are directly posted under the opinion piece column? I did not ping him, as I am not disagreeing with him. --ZebraaaLounge (talk) 11:34, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I am not sure why you posted the link to one Washington Post opinion piece and the general link for the New York Times’ opinion section, but not the actual URL of the contested article. While the article is not an opinion piece, it does not impress me as a piece of great journalism or neutrality, and looking at the perennial sources I find that the Times of India is not considered reliable especially due to bias favoring the current government. Despite my abysmal knowledge of Indian politics, I know that sectarians tensions between Muslims and Hindus is a political topic there, so I would agree with the removal of the source, though not for the exact reason Ohnoitsjamie gave in their edit summary. TigraanClick here for my talk page ("private" contact) 13:44, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Forgot to ping ZebraaaLounge. TigraanClick here for my talk page ("private" contact) 13:44, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I acknowledge that it's not labeled as an opinion piece; however, my main objection was the material it was attached to in the lede. That is, the lede should succinctly summarize a topic, and if we're going to make any broad statements about the topic, they should be sourceable to more than one reliable source. OhNoitsJamie Talk 14:19, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Duplicate Citations[edit] For the page Ben Porat Yosef, I tried to cite the source for the data about the number of students and faculty in the info table. I used the same source for multiple stats, so I copy and pasted the reference (the visual editor doesn’t work for tables). However, instead of simply using the same reference like it usually does, it created two separate occurrences of the same cited piece. How to I fix this? A. Rosenberg (talk) 14:08, 16 November 2021 (UTC) @Asher Rosenberg: I added ref code to the two US News sources. The code you added was for different refs. TimTempleton (talk) (cont) 14:29, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Ok, thank you. A. Rosenberg (talk) 14:31, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Sander Gilman[edit] I just updated my own entry and WTMitchell reverted the changes as they appeared to him unhelpful. How do I have my changes accepted? — Preceding unsigned comment added by 154.27.115.197 (talk) 15:02, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Keep in mind that without an account, we have no way of knowing that you are who you say you are(not that I disbelieve you, just saying). Nevertheless, you should not edit the article about you directly in most cases, please see the autobiography policy; if you have changes to propose, please offer them on the article talk page, Talk:Sander Gilman, in the form of an edit request(click for instructions) Preferably, the article about you should summarize what independent reliable sources say about you, but please offer any suggestions for changes that you have. 331dot (talk) 15:11, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Hi Sander, the best way to get information to stick on Wikipedia is to cite your sources. For example the second referenced Emory page (used in Writing section) does list your professorship of psychiatry, but doesn't mention an emeritus professor position that I can see. The other Emory page referenced in Academic Career (currently ref #1) is a dead link, so it's unlikely to be supporting a statement about a position appointed in 2021. ? Pelagic ( messages ) 19:13, 17 November 2021 (UTC) citing references[edit] I have an article which is up for deletion if I dont insert reliable references.

FlowerMoon593 (talk) 16:38, 16 November 2021 (UTC) That link is an interview so confers zero notability, others are welcome to chime in too, but you don't get to choose! Theroadislong (talk) 16:42, 16 November 2021 (UTC) @FlowerMoon593: I agree with Theroadislong that the interview does not determine notability. I suggest taking a look at WP:RS for help on determining what is and isn't a reliable source to help determing an article's notability. ? Blaze The WolfTalkBlaze Wolf#6545 16:44, 16 November 2021 (UTC) FlowerMoon593, it may help to realise that Wikipedia is not interested in what the subject of an article says or wants to say about themselves, or what their associates say about them. Wikipedia is only interested in what people who have no connection with the subject, and who have not been prompted or fed information on behalf of the subject, have chosen to publish about the subject in reliable sources. --ColinFine (talk) 17:02, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Ok, If it isnt notable then duly noted and I wont be using it. Thankyou. FlowerMoon593 (talk) 19:32, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Linking[edit] Hello, Is linking to other pages on Wikimedia preferred over linking to the entity itself (i.e. Marshall Daily News linking to Media in Marshall, Texas rather than the actual Marshall Daily News site? Does this depend on the quality of the Wikimedia page? If the Wikimedia page is preferred can/should I put a reference note that leads users directly to the actual source? Is there a reason to double link a place: Bar Harbor, Maine -- with Maine linked to lead just to the state entry or to Bar Harbor (Maine) which is the actual site under discussion. If a webpage exists for a citation shouldn't it be linked rather than the Wayback machine? I apologize if these questions are covered in any of the FAQs -- I couldn't find them addressed in this particular manner. — Preceding unsigned comment added by MAK999KAM (talk • contribs) 17:45, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Fewer more specific links are preferred. So just linking Bar Harbor (Maine) is better than links to Bar Harbor/Bar Harbor (Maine) and Maine. Best, Barkeep49 (talk) 18:00, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I think I understand your questions. In order: Yes, if we have an article or redirect about the topic. If we don't have an article, a red link may be reasonable and may not be. Under very few circumstances should you ever link to the topic directly in the main content of an article (see also how pages are laid out). No, given the article exists. See #1. No. We are not a directory. We prefer the most specific topic if possible, so link the whole text to Bar Harbor. See WP:SEAOFBLUE. "If it exists" is doing a lot of work there, but yes. See also WP:Link rot. Let me know if I missed something or you have additional context you would like to add.

Morris (talk) 18:59, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Hello, Morris. That's called an infobox, and if you edit the source, you will see {{infobox person at the top of the article, and you can edit the parameters within that. See Template:infobox person if you need more information about what the parameters should contain.

I've taken a chance and "Continued to site" anyway to leave this message, and suggest somebody investigate the matter. It may of course be a false alarm, but it seems odd that a long-established security program would make such an error with such a prominent site as Wikepedia. I'm not so far seeing any signs of unusual activity on my system, but I am emphatically not an IT expert. {The poster formerly known as 87.81.230.195} 90.205.225.31 (talk) 19:21, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I'd suggest running a system scan on your entire PC to see if for whatever reason Malwarebytes missed some Malware and has infected your PC.

I can understand how some editors may read that sentence and not understand that the solidus is incorrect. GoingBatty (talk) 03:55, 17 November 2021 (UTC) It certainly confused me. I have now successfully used an n-dash between the seasons in the dates (I tried a hyphen first, because I didn't spot the difference on screen, though I should have guessed an n-dash would be needed; a hyphen produces a different, green, error message.).--Verbarson (talk) 10:33, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Gut-brain axis edits[edit] Hello, I've been working on the "gut-brain axis" page.

ClaudineChionh (talk – contribs) 00:06, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you for your response. Do I understand correctly that ... ... using the {{reply to}} template is equivalent to prefixing the username with an "@", eg. @ClaudineChionh? ... and use of the "@" username construct causes a notification to be delivered to username? Deicas (talk) 00:56, 17 November 2021 (UTC) {{reply to}} by default will prefix the username with "@" and append a colon. Using this template, or manually linking to the user, will notify the pinged user if they have allowed notifications. ClaudineChionh (talk – contribs) 01:02, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Using their linked username, like this Deicas (just don't copy a fancy one, because they it looks like they signed it), also serves as a ping. Note that the ping must occur as part of the original comment, and at the same time as the comment is signed and saved. Fixing it later will not work.

On the page Philip Davies, the following is written in the introduction: "he is the most rebellious serving Conservative MP, having voted against the Tory whip over 250 times in the course of his parliamentary career, and he has been criticised for "talking out" Parliamentary Bills not supported by the government and by doing so "kill off legislation he doesn't like"." So, since the Conservatives have been in power since 2010, how can be Mr. Davies be called "rebellious" for voting against bills not supported by the Conservative government? This is very unclear and doesn’t appear to be phrased right. Thank you. ActiveContributor2020 (talk) 02:03, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Looking at the revision history "most rebellious" has been there since 2014. Could be time for a change. ––FormalDude talk 02:12, 17 November 2021 (UTC) It seems like 2 different things; 1) he's voted in 'opposition' to the party line the greatest number of times and 2) He's talked out bills he dislikes or not supported by the Govt. – presumably proposed by opposition parties.

Any article on your father would need to cite more than just a single source, per Wikipedia:Notability policies.

Google's Knowledge Graph uses a wide variety of sources. There may be a text paragraph ending with "Wikipedia" to indicate that particular text was copied from Wikipedia. An image and other text before or after the Wikipedia excerpt may be from sources completely unrelated to Wikipedia. We have no control over how Google presents our information, but Google's Knowledge Graph has a "Feedback" link where anyone can mark a field as wrong. The same feedback facility is also provided on Bing and some other search engines. --ColinFine (talk) 13:42, 17 November 2021 (UTC) For curiosity, I did the same search, on Google. It seems that the IP may be misinterpreting the results they got. The 5.1 Million figure is not associated with S. Korea in my results, but a worldwide total.

That's a red link as I type because you haven't yet created it. However, like other red links, once you click on them you'll be allowed to do so. These pages are to describe yourself in relation to what editing you plan to do in Wikipedia (see WP:USERPAGE for details of this and related pages). It can assist other editors if you also place the same template on the Talk Page of the articles you are editing where that payment or WP:COI is relevant. Note that the advice on the COI guide says that this includes making a declaration in edit summaries when adding to articles. Mike Turnbull (talk) 15:28, 17 November 2021 (UTC) self-citing and corrections[edit] Hello. I was unable to add a question to the Talk pages and I might have done something wrong. I apologize for going about things the wrong way, but I do stand by my corrections. Here's what happened: I have just published "Francis and Clare the Struggles of the Saints of Assisi," which Kirkus Reviews said was “lucidly written, a scrupulously thorough account.” On pub date yesterday 11/16/2021 I added my book as a reference on the following entries: Francis of Assisi, Clare of Assisi, Agnes of Bohemia, Elias of Cortona, and Pope Gregory IX. I also made some corrections and added my book and page numbers as a reference on Elias of Cortona and Agnes of Bohemia. Another point: Yesterday the coding of the ISBN numbers seemed to be correct but today the ISBN number on some entries leads to the WIKI ISBN search page and does not retrieve the book. Here are the links to the pages I mention: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_of_Assisi https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clare_of_Assisi https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnes_of_Bohemia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elias_of_Cortona https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Gregory_IX Thanks for your time and assistance. I am glad to have finally found the help desk. Best wishes, Kathleen BradyKathleen Brady (talk) 15:16, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Hello, Kathleen Brady, and thank you for wanting to help improve Wikipedia. But please do not ever add a citation to your own work, as that is regarded as a conflict of interest. You are welcome to suggest adding it, by making an WP:edit request on the article's talk page, so that an uninvolved editor can decide whether or not it is appropriate to add. I don't know why you were unable to add a question: what happened when you tried?. See also SELFCITE. --ColinFine (talk) 15:43, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Actually, contrary to what ColinFine has said, it can sometimes be appropriate to cite one's own work. The guidance says Using material you have written or published is allowed within reason, but only if it is relevant, conforms to the content policies, including WP:SELFPUB, and is not excessive. With Wikipedia's WP:BRD policy, be Bold but prepared for someone to Revert: then Discuss on the Talk Page of the article. (Note that it is very rarely appropriate to directly edit an article about yourself, if one exists, but that's another topic.) Mike Turnbull (talk) 16:39, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you, Mike Turnbull. There seem to be different interpretations of the rules so I am going to remove my insertions and corrections.Kathleen Brady (talk) 12:50, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Hi, @Kathleen, thanks for bringing your in-depth subject knowledge to Wikipedia! Google Books lists [1] the ISBN of your book as 1737549808 / ISBN 9781737549802. But at Agnes of Bohemia you entered it as 978-1565482210, which appears to be The lady : Clare of Assisi : early documents by Regis J Armstrong [2]. Looking now at Clare of Assisi, it does have ISBN 978-1737549802. So I think what I stumbled on in the Agnes article is tangential to your main concern. Linking ISBNs to Special:BookSources is by design. If a book was available at multiple booksellers and libraries, who are we to direct the reader to a specific store? WorldCat [3] has an Amazon link for anyone interested in purchasing. . ? Pelagic ( messages ) 20:36, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you, Pelagic. I shall address this.

I needed somebodys help in deleting this link to a history page of an article I'm revising and improving as nobody's able to help me in the Tagalog Wikipedia. I unwittingwly inserted a link to a copyrighted book that I was browsing while developing an article. Much appreciation to anybody who could help. https://tl.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aklat_ng_Pahayag&oldid=1906499 Atn20112222 (talk) 05:40, 18 November 2021 (UTC) This is the English Wikipedia, and I'm afraid that various people will say they can do little to help, and anyway probably no-one here speaks Tagálog. I'll have a go, although this is unusual. In general terms, the vast majority of books and journals printed since around 1930 (it varies by country) are still in copyright anyway. There's nothing wrong in referencing, or linking to, any book or journal. It's the actual reproduction of copyright material by anyone else that's the problem, not the linking to it. Obviously linking to a site with a breach of copyright (eg containing a free download of a copyright work) is not allowed. For example, the brief D. R. Hillers article on Revelation 13:18 in the reflist is freely online at Bulletin of ASOR. In fact, it's a {{cite journal}} and not a {{cite book}}, and I have updated the reference. It's great that the Tagalog Wikipedia uses the English templates! Plus a Captcha as well... The url of the Ang Pahayag kay Juan (Statement/Gospel of St. John?) gives me a warning that it's on a blacklist. I suggest that you simply delete the whole reference, leaving the main text intact. There are probably better sources for this book. The other only links with a working url are [5] which can be be reffed as Lohnes, Kate. "Siege of Jerusalem: Jewish-Roman war [70 ce]". Britannica Online. Retrieved 18 November 2021., and [6] which should be White, L. Michael. "Understanding the Book of Revelation". Frontline. Retrieved 18 November 2021.

There seems a strong correlation between this and FIFA, which is commonly known by the acronym for the French name. --Jayron32 19:02, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks, Jayron32. The acronym is the title that is most commonly used in English-language sources, so I will just leave it be. Are the names in the first sentence of the lede correctly formatted? Tyrone Madera (talk) 19:21, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Contributions[edit] Hello, While editing a few articles back in 2007 and 2008, I edited under 152.130.7.130. This was a public omputer with many more edits than the ones I did. Is there any way for me to take credit for 8 or 10 of the edits under this address now that I'm editing using a Username? No problem if this is not possible. HeartSpoon HeartSpoon (talk) — Preceding undated comment added 20:05, 18 November 2021 (UTC) HeartSpoon There is no way to assign those edits to your account.

However, I am putting this here because there is a larger community here. The question here is: Which article title do I use for attribution when the article was translated/copied before the title page (e.g. translations from when Climate change was titled Global warming)? I just thought I'd want to clear things up. Thanks, Caehlla2357 (talk) 03:00, 15 November 2021 (UTC) @Caehlla2357: Hi there! The guidelines and policies at tlwiki may be very different from those here at enwiki. I suggest you ask at the tlwiki Help desk, or at the talk page of the article in question. Good luck! GoingBatty (talk) 03:15, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Ah, yes. Of course. But as a general guideline (for future reference here at English Wikipedia), what is it? Thanks, Caehlla2357 (talk) 03:17, 15 November 2021 (UTC) When I do this, I usually use the current page title. I think that is consistent with the advice at WP:RIA, which gives a sample edit summary of NOTE: The previous edit as of 22:31, October 14, 2015?, copied content from the Wikipedia page at [[Exact name of page copied from]]; see its history for attribution. – so for example, directing people to the history of Climate change to see the original contributors of the copied content. The history of the article will also contain a record of the page move. DanCherek (talk) 03:31, 15 November 2021 (UTC) What I had done is mention both the current and the former name. But I think you may be right. Thanks, Caehlla2357 (talk) 14:55, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Fixing a bug in a template[edit] I'm looking at this page: Truth_in_Video_Game_Rating_Act The page currently says: "Enacted by 109th congress" The box that's filled out says: "Introduced by=109th" These are two substantially different things and they need to line up.

Get written about enough by relevant secondary sources, and somebody (not you: see WP:COI) will probably start an article. Meanwhile, I'd concentrate on making music people will be interested in, rather than worrying about the lack of an article here.

When I added the documentation for it, it created a documentation page for smaller block template. Perhaps it is because of the "template tranclusion" line in it. I don't know what transclusion is. Can anyone please check and tell if I did it the right way or not. Lightbluerain? (Talk | contribs) 17:46, 15 November 2021 (UTC) @Lightbluerain: The reason is that Wikisource:Template:Xxxx-larger block uses the same documentation page as Wikisource:Template:smaller block.

Joseph2302 (talk) 11:15, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Identifying opinion pieces[edit] I know opinion pieces are not reliable. I thought only those which are mentioned as opinion pieces as this article is an opinion piece, but administrator Ohnoitsjamie removed this article as an opinion piece which was not mentioned by the website as an opinion piece. So, which should be seen as an opinion piece, other than those which are directly posted under the opinion piece column? I did not ping him, as I am not disagreeing with him. --ZebraaaLounge (talk) 11:34, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I am not sure why you posted the link to one Washington Post opinion piece and the general link for the New York Times’ opinion section, but not the actual URL of the contested article. While the article is not an opinion piece, it does not impress me as a piece of great journalism or neutrality, and looking at the perennial sources I find that the Times of India is not considered reliable especially due to bias favoring the current government. Despite my abysmal knowledge of Indian politics, I know that sectarians tensions between Muslims and Hindus is a political topic there, so I would agree with the removal of the source, though not for the exact reason Ohnoitsjamie gave in their edit summary. TigraanClick here for my talk page ("private" contact) 13:44, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Forgot to ping ZebraaaLounge. TigraanClick here for my talk page ("private" contact) 13:44, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I acknowledge that it's not labeled as an opinion piece; however, my main objection was the material it was attached to in the lede. That is, the lede should succinctly summarize a topic, and if we're going to make any broad statements about the topic, they should be sourceable to more than one reliable source. OhNoitsJamie Talk 14:19, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Duplicate Citations[edit] For the page Ben Porat Yosef, I tried to cite the source for the data about the number of students and faculty in the info table. I used the same source for multiple stats, so I copy and pasted the reference (the visual editor doesn’t work for tables). However, instead of simply using the same reference like it usually does, it created two separate occurrences of the same cited piece. How to I fix this? A.

Nevertheless, you should not edit the article about you directly in most cases, please see the autobiography policy; if you have changes to propose, please offer them on the article talk page, Talk:Sander Gilman, in the form of an edit request(click for instructions) Preferably, the article about you should summarize what independent reliable sources say about you, but please offer any suggestions for changes that you have. 331dot (talk) 15:11, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Hi Sander, the best way to get information to stick on Wikipedia is to cite your sources. For example the second referenced Emory page (used in Writing section) does list your professorship of psychiatry, but doesn't mention an emeritus professor position that I can see. The other Emory page referenced in Academic Career (currently ref #1) is a dead link, so it's unlikely to be supporting a statement about a position appointed in 2021. ? Pelagic ( messages ) 19:13, 17 November 2021 (UTC) citing references[edit] I have an article which is up for deletion if I dont insert reliable references.

Blaze The WolfTalkBlaze Wolf#6545 16:44, 16 November 2021 (UTC) FlowerMoon593, it may help to realise that Wikipedia is not interested in what the subject of an article says or wants to say about themselves, or what their associates say about them. Wikipedia is only interested in what people who have no connection with the subject, and who have not been prompted or fed information on behalf of the subject, have chosen to publish about the subject in reliable sources. --ColinFine (talk) 17:02, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Ok, If it isnt notable then duly noted and I wont be using it.

FlowerMoon593 (talk) 19:32, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Linking[edit] Hello, Is linking to other pages on Wikimedia preferred over linking to the entity itself (i.e. Marshall Daily News linking to Media in Marshall, Texas rather than the actual Marshall Daily News site? Does this depend on the quality of the Wikimedia page? If the Wikimedia page is preferred can/should I put a reference note that leads users directly to the actual source? Is there a reason to double link a place: Bar Harbor, Maine -- with Maine linked to lead just to the state entry or to Bar Harbor (Maine) which is the actual site under discussion. If a webpage exists for a citation shouldn't it be linked rather than the Wayback machine? I apologize if these questions are covered in any of the FAQs -- I couldn't find them addressed in this particular manner. — Preceding unsigned comment added by MAK999KAM (talk • contribs) 17:45, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Fewer more specific links are preferred. So just linking Bar Harbor (Maine) is better than links to Bar Harbor/Bar Harbor (Maine) and Maine. Best, Barkeep49 (talk) 18:00, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I think I understand your questions. In order: Yes, if we have an article or redirect about the topic. If we don't have an article, a red link may be reasonable and may not be. Under very few circumstances should you ever link to the topic directly in the main content of an article (see also how pages are laid out). No, given the article exists. See #1. No. We are not a directory. We prefer the most specific topic if possible, so link the whole text to Bar Harbor. See WP:SEAOFBLUE. "If it exists" is doing a lot of work there, but yes. See also WP:Link rot. Let me know if I missed something or you have additional context you would like to add.

Is there a notification template, referring to Mr.X, that I can include in my comment? What is the Wikipedia best practice for creating such a notification in a talk page comment? Deicas (talk) 00:02, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @Deicas: Try {{reply to}} (which I have used here) or {{talkback}}. ClaudineChionh (talk – contribs) 00:06, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you for your response. Do I understand correctly that ... ... using the {{reply to}} template is equivalent to prefixing the username with an "@", eg. @ClaudineChionh? ... and use of the "@" username construct causes a notification to be delivered to username? Deicas (talk) 00:56, 17 November 2021 (UTC) {{reply to}} by default will prefix the username with "@" and append a colon. Using this template, or manually linking to the user, will notify the pinged user if they have allowed notifications. ClaudineChionh (talk – contribs) 01:02, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Using their linked username, like this Deicas (just don't copy a fancy one, because they it looks like they signed it), also serves as a ping. Note that the ping must occur as part of the original comment, and at the same time as the comment is signed and saved. Fixing it later will not work. A later ping has to be in its own signed comment, if it wasn't within the same edit as the original comment. -- Valjean (talk) 01:45, 17 November 2021 (UTC) John Bullock (1731–1809)[edit] ref number 5 is not quite right - with year of publishing etc - please help. thanks115.70.23.77 (talk) 01:17, 17 November 2021 (UTC) You could add the |year= parameter with the year of publishing.

On the page Philip Davies, the following is written in the introduction: "he is the most rebellious serving Conservative MP, having voted against the Tory whip over 250 times in the course of his parliamentary career, and he has been criticised for "talking out" Parliamentary Bills not supported by the government and by doing so "kill off legislation he doesn't like"." So, since the Conservatives have been in power since 2010, how can be Mr. Davies be called "rebellious" for voting against bills not supported by the Conservative government? This is very unclear and doesn’t appear to be phrased right. Thank you.

Google's Knowledge Graph uses a wide variety of sources. There may be a text paragraph ending with "Wikipedia" to indicate that particular text was copied from Wikipedia. An image and other text before or after the Wikipedia excerpt may be from sources completely unrelated to Wikipedia. We have no control over how Google presents our information, but Google's Knowledge Graph has a "Feedback" link where anyone can mark a field as wrong. The same feedback facility is also provided on Bing and some other search engines. --ColinFine (talk) 13:42, 17 November 2021 (UTC) For curiosity, I did the same search, on Google.

These pages are to describe yourself in relation to what editing you plan to do in Wikipedia (see WP:USERPAGE for details of this and related pages). It can assist other editors if you also place the same template on the Talk Page of the articles you are editing where that payment or WP:COI is relevant. Note that the advice on the COI guide says that this includes making a declaration in edit summaries when adding to articles. Mike Turnbull (talk) 15:28, 17 November 2021 (UTC) self-citing and corrections[edit] Hello. I was unable to add a question to the Talk pages and I might have done something wrong. I apologize for going about things the wrong way, but I do stand by my corrections. Here's what happened: I have just published "Francis and Clare the Struggles of the Saints of Assisi," which Kirkus Reviews said was “lucidly written, a scrupulously thorough account.” On pub date yesterday 11/16/2021 I added my book as a reference on the following entries: Francis of Assisi, Clare of Assisi, Agnes of Bohemia, Elias of Cortona, and Pope Gregory IX. I also made some corrections and added my book and page numbers as a reference on Elias of Cortona and Agnes of Bohemia. Another point: Yesterday the coding of the ISBN numbers seemed to be correct but today the ISBN number on some entries leads to the WIKI ISBN search page and does not retrieve the book. Here are the links to the pages I mention: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_of_Assisi https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clare_of_Assisi https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnes_of_Bohemia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elias_of_Cortona https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Gregory_IX Thanks for your time and assistance. I am glad to have finally found the help desk. Best wishes, Kathleen BradyKathleen Brady (talk) 15:16, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Hello, Kathleen Brady, and thank you for wanting to help improve Wikipedia. But please do not ever add a citation to your own work, as that is regarded as a conflict of interest. You are welcome to suggest adding it, by making an WP:edit request on the article's talk page, so that an uninvolved editor can decide whether or not it is appropriate to add. I don't know why you were unable to add a question: what happened when you tried?. See also SELFCITE. --ColinFine (talk) 15:43, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Actually, contrary to what ColinFine has said, it can sometimes be appropriate to cite one's own work. The guidance says Using material you have written or published is allowed within reason, but only if it is relevant, conforms to the content policies, including WP:SELFPUB, and is not excessive. With Wikipedia's WP:BRD policy, be Bold but prepared for someone to Revert: then Discuss on the Talk Page of the article. (Note that it is very rarely appropriate to directly edit an article about yourself, if one exists, but that's another topic.)

Google Books lists [1] the ISBN of your book as 1737549808 / ISBN 9781737549802. But at Agnes of Bohemia you entered it as 978-1565482210, which appears to be The lady : Clare of Assisi : early documents by Regis J Armstrong [2]. Looking now at Clare of Assisi, it does have ISBN 978-1737549802. So I think what I stumbled on in the Agnes article is tangential to your main concern. Linking ISBNs to Special:BookSources is by design. If a book was available at multiple booksellers and libraries, who are we to direct the reader to a specific store? WorldCat [3] has an Amazon link for anyone interested in purchasing. . ? Pelagic ( messages ) 20:36, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you, Pelagic. I shall address this.

I'll have a go, although this is unusual. In general terms, the vast majority of books and journals printed since around 1930 (it varies by country) are still in copyright anyway. There's nothing wrong in referencing, or linking to, any book or journal. It's the actual reproduction of copyright material by anyone else that's the problem, not the linking to it. Obviously linking to a site with a breach of copyright (eg containing a free download of a copyright work) is not allowed. For example, the brief D. R. Hillers article on Revelation 13:18 in the reflist is freely online at Bulletin of ASOR. In fact, it's a {{cite journal}} and not a {{cite book}}, and I have updated the reference. It's great that the Tagalog Wikipedia uses the English templates! Plus a Captcha as well... The url of the Ang Pahayag kay Juan (Statement/Gospel of St. John?) gives me a warning that it's on a blacklist. I suggest that you simply delete the whole reference, leaving the main text intact. There are probably better sources for this book. The other only links with a working url are [5] which can be be reffed as Lohnes, Kate. "Siege of Jerusalem: Jewish-Roman war [70 ce]". Britannica Online. Retrieved 18 November 2021., and [6] which should be White, L. Michael. "Understanding the Book of Revelation". Frontline. Retrieved 18 November 2021.

I have reverted your most recent edit to the page and warned you as you added info for a Subnautica 3 while stating there are merely rumors about it. Wikipedia does not add information solely based on rumors, if we did then a lot of false information could be added to Wikipedia simply because someone heard a rumor about it. Information needs to be reliably sourced in order to be added to an article (with certain exceptions which I will not detail here). ? Blaze The WolfTalkBlaze Wolf#6545 16:28, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Which article title should be used[edit] Hello! For the page INAPL, should the acronym of the institution be used as the article title, should it be titled the National Institute of Anthropology and Latin American Thought, or should it use its official Spanish name: Instituto Nacional De Antropología y Pensamiento Latinoamericano? Thank you for your help, Tyrone Madera (talk) 19:00, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Per WP:UCN, generally we use the title that is most commonly used in English-language sources. If it is primarily known by the acronym, use that. There seems a strong correlation between this and FIFA, which is commonly known by the acronym for the French name. --Jayron32 19:02, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks, Jayron32. The acronym is the title that is most commonly used in English-language sources, so I will just leave it be. Are the names in the first sentence of the lede correctly formatted?

However, I am putting this here because there is a larger community here. The question here is: Which article title do I use for attribution when the article was translated/copied before the title page (e.g. translations from when Climate change was titled Global warming)? I just thought I'd want to clear things up. Thanks, Caehlla2357 (talk) 03:00, 15 November 2021 (UTC) @Caehlla2357: Hi there! The guidelines and policies at tlwiki may be very different from those here at enwiki. I suggest you ask at the tlwiki Help desk, or at the talk page of the article in question. Good luck! GoingBatty (talk) 03:15, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Ah, yes. Of course. But as a general guideline (for future reference here at English Wikipedia), what is it? Thanks, Caehlla2357 (talk) 03:17, 15 November 2021 (UTC) When I do this, I usually use the current page title. I think that is consistent with the advice at WP:RIA, which gives a sample edit summary of NOTE: The previous edit as of 22:31, October 14, 2015?, copied content from the Wikipedia page at [[Exact name of page copied from]]; see its history for attribution. – so for example, directing people to the history of Climate change to see the original contributors of the copied content. The history of the article will also contain a record of the page move. DanCherek (talk) 03:31, 15 November 2021 (UTC) What I had done is mention both the current and the former name. But I think you may be right. Thanks, Caehlla2357 (talk) 14:55, 15 November 2021 (UTC) Fixing a bug in a template[edit] I'm looking at this page: Truth_in_Video_Game_Rating_Act The page currently says: "Enacted by 109th congress" The box that's filled out says: "Introduced by=109th" These are two substantially different things and they need to line up.

Get written about enough by relevant secondary sources, and somebody (not you: see WP:COI) will probably start an article. Meanwhile, I'd concentrate on making music people will be interested in, rather than worrying about the lack of an article here.

When I added the documentation for it, it created a documentation page for smaller block template. Perhaps it is because of the "template tranclusion" line in it. I don't know what transclusion is. Can anyone please check and tell if I did it the right way or not. Lightbluerain? (Talk | contribs) 17:46, 15 November 2021 (UTC) @Lightbluerain: The reason is that Wikisource:Template:Xxxx-larger block uses the same documentation page as Wikisource:Template:smaller block.

Joseph2302 (talk) 11:15, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Identifying opinion pieces[edit] I know opinion pieces are not reliable. I thought only those which are mentioned as opinion pieces as this article is an opinion piece, but administrator Ohnoitsjamie removed this article as an opinion piece which was not mentioned by the website as an opinion piece. So, which should be seen as an opinion piece, other than those which are directly posted under the opinion piece column? I did not ping him, as I am not disagreeing with him. --ZebraaaLounge (talk) 11:34, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I am not sure why you posted the link to one Washington Post opinion piece and the general link for the New York Times’ opinion section, but not the actual URL of the contested article. While the article is not an opinion piece, it does not impress me as a piece of great journalism or neutrality, and looking at the perennial sources I find that the Times of India is not considered reliable especially due to bias favoring the current government. Despite my abysmal knowledge of Indian politics, I know that sectarians tensions between Muslims and Hindus is a political topic there, so I would agree with the removal of the source, though not for the exact reason Ohnoitsjamie gave in their edit summary. TigraanClick here for my talk page ("private" contact) 13:44, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Forgot to ping ZebraaaLounge. TigraanClick here for my talk page ("private" contact) 13:44, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I acknowledge that it's not labeled as an opinion piece; however, my main objection was the material it was attached to in the lede. That is, the lede should succinctly summarize a topic, and if we're going to make any broad statements about the topic, they should be sourceable to more than one reliable source. OhNoitsJamie Talk 14:19, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Duplicate Citations[edit] For the page Ben Porat Yosef, I tried to cite the source for the data about the number of students and faculty in the info table. I used the same source for multiple stats, so I copy and pasted the reference (the visual editor doesn’t work for tables). However, instead of simply using the same reference like it usually does, it created two separate occurrences of the same cited piece. How to I fix this? A. Rosenberg (talk) 14:08, 16 November 2021 (UTC) @Asher Rosenberg: I added ref code to the two US News sources. The code you added was for different refs.

How do I have my changes accepted? — Preceding unsigned comment added by 154.27.115.197 (talk) 15:02, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Keep in mind that without an account, we have no way of knowing that you are who you say you are(not that I disbelieve you, just saying). Nevertheless, you should not edit the article about you directly in most cases, please see the autobiography policy; if you have changes to propose, please offer them on the article talk page, Talk:Sander Gilman, in the form of an edit request(click for instructions) Preferably, the article about you should summarize what independent reliable sources say about you, but please offer any suggestions for changes that you have. 331dot (talk) 15:11, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Hi Sander, the best way to get information to stick on Wikipedia is to cite your sources. For example the second referenced Emory page (used in Writing section) does list your professorship of psychiatry, but doesn't mention an emeritus professor position that I can see. The other Emory page referenced in Academic Career (currently ref #1) is a dead link, so it's unlikely to be supporting a statement about a position appointed in 2021. ? Pelagic ( messages ) 19:13, 17 November 2021 (UTC) citing references[edit] I have an article which is up for deletion if I dont insert reliable references.

Theroadislong (talk) 16:42, 16 November 2021 (UTC) @FlowerMoon593: I agree with Theroadislong that the interview does not determine notability. I suggest taking a look at WP:RS for help on determining what is and isn't a reliable source to help determing an article's notability. ? Blaze The WolfTalkBlaze Wolf#6545 16:44, 16 November 2021 (UTC) FlowerMoon593, it may help to realise that Wikipedia is not interested in what the subject of an article says or wants to say about themselves, or what their associates say about them. Wikipedia is only interested in what people who have no connection with the subject, and who have not been prompted or fed information on behalf of the subject, have chosen to publish about the subject in reliable sources. --ColinFine (talk) 17:02, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Ok, If it isnt notable then duly noted and I wont be using it. Thankyou. FlowerMoon593 (talk) 19:32, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Linking[edit] Hello, Is linking to other pages on Wikimedia preferred over linking to the entity itself (i.e. Marshall Daily News linking to Media in Marshall, Texas rather than the actual Marshall Daily News site? Does this depend on the quality of the Wikimedia page? If the Wikimedia page is preferred can/should I put a reference note that leads users directly to the actual source? Is there a reason to double link a place: Bar Harbor, Maine -- with Maine linked to lead just to the state entry or to Bar Harbor (Maine) which is the actual site under discussion. If a webpage exists for a citation shouldn't it be linked rather than the Wayback machine? I apologize if these questions are covered in any of the FAQs -- I couldn't find them addressed in this particular manner. — Preceding unsigned comment added by MAK999KAM (talk • contribs) 17:45, 16 November 2021 (UTC) Fewer more specific links are preferred. So just linking Bar Harbor (Maine) is better than links to Bar Harbor/Bar Harbor (Maine) and Maine. Best, Barkeep49 (talk) 18:00, 16 November 2021 (UTC) I think I understand your questions. In order: Yes, if we have an article or redirect about the topic. If we don't have an article, a red link may be reasonable and may not be. Under very few circumstances should you ever link to the topic directly in the main content of an article (see also how pages are laid out). No, given the article exists. See #1. No. We are not a directory. We prefer the most specific topic if possible, so link the whole text to Bar Harbor. See WP:SEAOFBLUE. "If it exists" is doing a lot of work there, but yes. See also WP:Link rot. Let me know if I missed something or you have additional context you would like to add.

According to {{Cite journal}}, which refers to Help:Citation Style 1#Dates, this should be acceptable, but I'm getting a red message: "Check date values in: |date= (help)", as here:[1] (I have cs1-maint messages displayed).

I can understand how some editors may read that sentence and not understand that the solidus is incorrect. GoingBatty (talk) 03:55, 17 November 2021 (UTC) It certainly confused me. I have now successfully used an n-dash between the seasons in the dates (I tried a hyphen first, because I didn't spot the difference on screen, though I should have guessed an n-dash would be needed; a hyphen produces a different, green, error message.).--Verbarson (talk) 10:33, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Gut-brain axis edits[edit] Hello, I've been working on the "gut-brain axis" page.

Deicas (talk) 00:56, 17 November 2021 (UTC) {{reply to}} by default will prefix the username with "@" and append a colon.

Note that the ping must occur as part of the original comment, and at the same time as the comment is signed and saved. Fixing it later will not work.

On the page Philip Davies, the following is written in the introduction: "he is the most rebellious serving Conservative MP, having voted against the Tory whip over 250 times in the course of his parliamentary career, and he has been criticised for "talking out" Parliamentary Bills not supported by the government and by doing so "kill off legislation he doesn't like"." So, since the Conservatives have been in power since 2010, how can be Mr. Davies be called "rebellious" for voting against bills not supported by the Conservative government? This is very unclear and doesn’t appear to be phrased right. Thank you.

Google's Knowledge Graph uses a wide variety of sources. There may be a text paragraph ending with "Wikipedia" to indicate that particular text was copied from Wikipedia. An image and other text before or after the Wikipedia excerpt may be from sources completely unrelated to Wikipedia. We have no control over how Google presents our information, but Google's Knowledge Graph has a "Feedback" link where anyone can mark a field as wrong. The same feedback facility is also provided on Bing and some other search engines. --ColinFine (talk) 13:42, 17 November 2021 (UTC) For curiosity, I did the same search, on Google.

These pages are to describe yourself in relation to what editing you plan to do in Wikipedia (see WP:USERPAGE for details of this and related pages). It can assist other editors if you also place the same template on the Talk Page of the articles you are editing where that payment or WP:COI is relevant.

Mike Turnbull (talk) 15:28, 17 November 2021 (UTC) self-citing and corrections[edit] Hello. I was unable to add a question to the Talk pages and I might have done something wrong. I apologize for going about things the wrong way, but I do stand by my corrections. Here's what happened: I have just published "Francis and Clare the Struggles of the Saints of Assisi," which Kirkus Reviews said was “lucidly written, a scrupulously thorough account.” On pub date yesterday 11/16/2021 I added my book as a reference on the following entries: Francis of Assisi, Clare of Assisi, Agnes of Bohemia, Elias of Cortona, and Pope Gregory IX. I also made some corrections and added my book and page numbers as a reference on Elias of Cortona and Agnes of Bohemia. Another point: Yesterday the coding of the ISBN numbers seemed to be correct but today the ISBN number on some entries leads to the WIKI ISBN search page and does not retrieve the book. Here are the links to the pages I mention: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_of_Assisi https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clare_of_Assisi https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnes_of_Bohemia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elias_of_Cortona https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Gregory_IX Thanks for your time and assistance. I am glad to have finally found the help desk. Best wishes, Kathleen BradyKathleen Brady (talk) 15:16, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Hello, Kathleen Brady, and thank you for wanting to help improve Wikipedia. But please do not ever add a citation to your own work, as that is regarded as a conflict of interest. You are welcome to suggest adding it, by making an WP:edit request on the article's talk page, so that an uninvolved editor can decide whether or not it is appropriate to add. I don't know why you were unable to add a question: what happened when you tried?. See also SELFCITE. --ColinFine (talk) 15:43, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Actually, contrary to what ColinFine has said, it can sometimes be appropriate to cite one's own work. The guidance says Using material you have written or published is allowed within reason, but only if it is relevant, conforms to the content policies, including WP:SELFPUB, and is not excessive. With Wikipedia's WP:BRD policy, be Bold but prepared for someone to Revert: then Discuss on the Talk Page of the article. (Note that it is very rarely appropriate to directly edit an article about yourself, if one exists, but that's another topic.)

Google Books lists [1] the ISBN of your book as 1737549808 / ISBN 9781737549802. But at Agnes of Bohemia you entered it as 978-1565482210, which appears to be The lady : Clare of Assisi : early documents by Regis J Armstrong [2]. Looking now at Clare of Assisi, it does have ISBN 978-1737549802. So I think what I stumbled on in the Agnes article is tangential to your main concern. Linking ISBNs to Special:BookSources is by design. If a book was available at multiple booksellers and libraries, who are we to direct the reader to a specific store? WorldCat [3] has an Amazon link for anyone interested in purchasing. . ? Pelagic ( messages ) 20:36, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you, Pelagic. I shall address this.

I'll have a go, although this is unusual. In general terms, the vast majority of books and journals printed since around 1930 (it varies by country) are still in copyright anyway. There's nothing wrong in referencing, or linking to, any book or journal. It's the actual reproduction of copyright material by anyone else that's the problem, not the linking to it. Obviously linking to a site with a breach of copyright (eg containing a free download of a copyright work) is not allowed. For example, the brief D. R. Hillers article on Revelation 13:18 in the reflist is freely online at Bulletin of ASOR. In fact, it's a {{cite journal}} and not a {{cite book}}, and I have updated the reference. It's great that the Tagalog Wikipedia uses the English templates! Plus a Captcha as well... The url of the Ang Pahayag kay Juan (Statement/Gospel of St. John?) gives me a warning that it's on a blacklist. I suggest that you simply delete the whole reference, leaving the main text intact. There are probably better sources for this book. The other only links with a working url are [5] which can be be reffed as Lohnes, Kate. "Siege of Jerusalem: Jewish-Roman war [70 ce]". Britannica Online. Retrieved 18 November 2021., and [6] which should be White, L. Michael. "Understanding the Book of Revelation". Frontline. Retrieved 18 November 2021.

I need to get the text back but I can't contact the deleting admin "Ponyo", it looks like they've blocked messages or I just don't know where to look. Thank you --Launch455 (talk) 09:36, 18 November 2021 (UTC) I'm alerting User:Ponyo of your post. User talk:Ponyo has been briefly semi-protected and you had unfortunate timing. PrimeHunter (talk) 11:01, 18 November 2021 (UTC) @Launch455: I can email you the content, but the subject of the draft in no way meets the notability criteria for inclusion and draft space is not a venue for hosting promotional content on "up and coming" NFTs. Please review the messages and links on your talk page for further information as to how your draft article was inappropriate for inclusion on Wikipedia.-- Jezebel's Ponyobons mots 20:43, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Repeated requests to login[edit] For the past 30 days, when I first go to Wikipedia each day, I find that I'm not logged in - even though each time I find this, I login again and check the "Keep me logged in for 365 days" box. I use a password that was NOT automatically generated either by the Wikipedia software or by my browser. I'm running on an iMac under Apple's OSX 10.13.6 software and have been using Google Chrome as my default browser (Version 95.0.4638.69 (Official Build) (x86_64)).

For both browsers to have the same problem seems strange, since cookies are definitely handled by the browser, not the OS afaik. I know very little about Macs. Do you ever actually log out of WP or close the browser completely (rather than leaving it minimised)? Tried leaving the browser open overnight?

I have reverted your most recent edit to the page and warned you as you added info for a Subnautica 3 while stating there are merely rumors about it. Wikipedia does not add information solely based on rumors, if we did then a lot of false information could be added to Wikipedia simply because someone heard a rumor about it. Information needs to be reliably sourced in order to be added to an article (with certain exceptions which I will not detail here). ? Blaze The WolfTalkBlaze Wolf#6545 16:28, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Which article title should be used[edit] Hello! For the page INAPL, should the acronym of the institution be used as the article title, should it be titled the National Institute of Anthropology and Latin American Thought, or should it use its official Spanish name: Instituto Nacional De Antropología y Pensamiento Latinoamericano? Thank you for your help, Tyrone Madera (talk) 19:00, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Per WP:UCN, generally we use the title that is most commonly used in English-language sources. If it is primarily known by the acronym, use that. There seems a strong correlation between this and FIFA, which is commonly known by the acronym for the French name. --Jayron32 19:02, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks, Jayron32. The acronym is the title that is most commonly used in English-language sources, so I will just leave it be. Are the names in the first sentence of the lede correctly formatted?

Deicas (talk) 00:02, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @Deicas: Try {{reply to}} (which I have used here) or {{talkback}}. ClaudineChionh (talk – contribs) 00:06, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you for your response. Do I understand correctly that ... ... using the {{reply to}} template is equivalent to prefixing the username with an "@", eg. @ClaudineChionh? ... and use of the "@" username construct causes a notification to be delivered to username? Deicas (talk) 00:56, 17 November 2021 (UTC) {{reply to}} by default will prefix the username with "@" and append a colon. Using this template, or manually linking to the user, will notify the pinged user if they have allowed notifications. ClaudineChionh (talk – contribs) 01:02, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Using their linked username, like this Deicas (just don't copy a fancy one, because they it looks like they signed it), also serves as a ping. Note that the ping must occur as part of the original comment, and at the same time as the comment is signed and saved. Fixing it later will not work. A later ping has to be in its own signed comment, if it wasn't within the same edit as the original comment. -- Valjean (talk) 01:45, 17 November 2021 (UTC) John Bullock (1731–1809)[edit] ref number 5 is not quite right - with year of publishing etc - please help. thanks115.70.23.77 (talk) 01:17, 17 November 2021 (UTC) You could add the |year= parameter with the year of publishing.

On the page Philip Davies, the following is written in the introduction: "he is the most rebellious serving Conservative MP, having voted against the Tory whip over 250 times in the course of his parliamentary career, and he has been criticised for "talking out" Parliamentary Bills not supported by the government and by doing so "kill off legislation he doesn't like"." So, since the Conservatives have been in power since 2010, how can be Mr. Davies be called "rebellious" for voting against bills not supported by the Conservative government? This is very unclear and doesn’t appear to be phrased right. Thank you. ActiveContributor2020 (talk) 02:03, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Looking at the revision history "most rebellious" has been there since 2014. Could be time for a change. ––FormalDude talk 02:12, 17 November 2021 (UTC) It seems like 2 different things; 1) he's voted in 'opposition' to the party line the greatest number of times and 2) He's talked out bills he dislikes or not supported by the Govt. – presumably proposed by opposition parties.

Any article on your father would need to cite more than just a single source, per Wikipedia:Notability policies. And furthermore, Wikipedia isn't an appropriate place to be promoting a book written by someone from your own family, even if it concerns a hero of the Greek resistance.

Google's Knowledge Graph uses a wide variety of sources. There may be a text paragraph ending with "Wikipedia" to indicate that particular text was copied from Wikipedia. An image and other text before or after the Wikipedia excerpt may be from sources completely unrelated to Wikipedia. We have no control over how Google presents our information, but Google's Knowledge Graph has a "Feedback" link where anyone can mark a field as wrong. The same feedback facility is also provided on Bing and some other search engines. --ColinFine (talk) 13:42, 17 November 2021 (UTC) For curiosity, I did the same search, on Google. It seems that the IP may be misinterpreting the results they got. The 5.1 Million figure is not associated with S. Korea in my results, but a worldwide total. The results page is astonishingly obfuscatory, Google should be praised for making it so difficult to interpret!!!!!

That's a red link as I type because you haven't yet created it. However, like other red links, once you click on them you'll be allowed to do so. These pages are to describe yourself in relation to what editing you plan to do in Wikipedia (see WP:USERPAGE for details of this and related pages). It can assist other editors if you also place the same template on the Talk Page of the articles you are editing where that payment or WP:COI is relevant. Note that the advice on the COI guide says that this includes making a declaration in edit summaries when adding to articles. Mike Turnbull (talk) 15:28, 17 November 2021 (UTC) self-citing and corrections[edit] Hello. I was unable to add a question to the Talk pages and I might have done something wrong. I apologize for going about things the wrong way, but I do stand by my corrections. Here's what happened: I have just published "Francis and Clare the Struggles of the Saints of Assisi," which Kirkus Reviews said was “lucidly written, a scrupulously thorough account.” On pub date yesterday 11/16/2021 I added my book as a reference on the following entries: Francis of Assisi, Clare of Assisi, Agnes of Bohemia, Elias of Cortona, and Pope Gregory IX. I also made some corrections and added my book and page numbers as a reference on Elias of Cortona and Agnes of Bohemia. Another point: Yesterday the coding of the ISBN numbers seemed to be correct but today the ISBN number on some entries leads to the WIKI ISBN search page and does not retrieve the book. Here are the links to the pages I mention: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_of_Assisi https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clare_of_Assisi https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnes_of_Bohemia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elias_of_Cortona https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Gregory_IX Thanks for your time and assistance. I am glad to have finally found the help desk. Best wishes, Kathleen BradyKathleen Brady (talk) 15:16, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Hello, Kathleen Brady, and thank you for wanting to help improve Wikipedia. But please do not ever add a citation to your own work, as that is regarded as a conflict of interest. You are welcome to suggest adding it, by making an WP:edit request on the article's talk page, so that an uninvolved editor can decide whether or not it is appropriate to add. I don't know why you were unable to add a question: what happened when you tried?. See also SELFCITE. --ColinFine (talk) 15:43, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Actually, contrary to what ColinFine has said, it can sometimes be appropriate to cite one's own work. The guidance says Using material you have written or published is allowed within reason, but only if it is relevant, conforms to the content policies, including WP:SELFPUB, and is not excessive. With Wikipedia's WP:BRD policy, be Bold but prepared for someone to Revert: then Discuss on the Talk Page of the article. (Note that it is very rarely appropriate to directly edit an article about yourself, if one exists, but that's another topic.) Mike Turnbull (talk) 16:39, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you, Mike Turnbull. There seem to be different interpretations of the rules so I am going to remove my insertions and corrections.Kathleen Brady (talk) 12:50, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Hi, @Kathleen, thanks for bringing your in-depth subject knowledge to Wikipedia! Google Books lists [1] the ISBN of your book as 1737549808 / ISBN 9781737549802. But at Agnes of Bohemia you entered it as 978-1565482210, which appears to be The lady : Clare of Assisi : early documents by Regis J Armstrong [2]. Looking now at Clare of Assisi, it does have ISBN 978-1737549802. So I think what I stumbled on in the Agnes article is tangential to your main concern. Linking ISBNs to Special:BookSources is by design. If a book was available at multiple booksellers and libraries, who are we to direct the reader to a specific store? WorldCat [3] has an Amazon link for anyone interested in purchasing. . ? Pelagic ( messages ) 20:36, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you, Pelagic. I shall address this.

KobiIheoma (talk) 04:26, 18 November 2021 (UTC) @KobiIheoma: The {{Cite web}} template can be a bit confusing because, in this case, the |website= parameter is actually used for the name of the work or publisher (see Help:Citation Style 1 § Work and publisher). In this case, "APA Div. 43: Society for Couple and Family Psychology" might be the right value. You have correctly provided the full URL in the |url= parameter.

I needed somebodys help in deleting this link to a history page of an article I'm revising and improving as nobody's able to help me in the Tagalog Wikipedia. I unwittingwly inserted a link to a copyrighted book that I was browsing while developing an article. Much appreciation to anybody who could help. https://tl.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aklat_ng_Pahayag&oldid=1906499 Atn20112222 (talk) 05:40, 18 November 2021 (UTC) This is the English Wikipedia, and I'm afraid that various people will say they can do little to help, and anyway probably no-one here speaks Tagálog. I'll have a go, although this is unusual. In general terms, the vast majority of books and journals printed since around 1930 (it varies by country) are still in copyright anyway. There's nothing wrong in referencing, or linking to, any book or journal. It's the actual reproduction of copyright material by anyone else that's the problem, not the linking to it. Obviously linking to a site with a breach of copyright (eg containing a free download of a copyright work) is not allowed. For example, the brief D. R. Hillers article on Revelation 13:18 in the reflist is freely online at Bulletin of ASOR. In fact, it's a {{cite journal}} and not a {{cite book}}, and I have updated the reference. It's great that the Tagalog Wikipedia uses the English templates! Plus a Captcha as well... The url of the Ang Pahayag kay Juan (Statement/Gospel of St. John?) gives me a warning that it's on a blacklist. I suggest that you simply delete the whole reference, leaving the main text intact. There are probably better sources for this book. The other only links with a working url are [5] which can be be reffed as Lohnes, Kate. "Siege of Jerusalem: Jewish-Roman war [70 ce]". Britannica Online. Retrieved 18 November 2021., and [6] which should be White, L. Michael. "Understanding the Book of Revelation". Frontline. Retrieved 18 November 2021. (Edit to see the code and paste into the article). I hope this may have helped: otherwise please let me know which specific link you are having trouble with. MinorProphet (talk) 10:43, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Hey there MinorProphet. I didn't make myself clear of what I wanted to happen. If you click on the link https://tl.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aklat_ng_Pahayag&oldid=1906499 , you would see a nonreference link in a subheader to a PDF file ending with https://... 8aec-03b7-426d-ab35-c8d7ac15b369.pdf. This was a mistake. I would like this article version [7] be hidden from the readers. This what I mean visually, for example , https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Seigenthaler&offset=20171127130845%7C812365719&action=history contains link versions in the history that are inaccesible and are denoted by a strikethrough 06:26, 12 September 2015. I'd like to see this 09:11, 11 Nobyembre 2021 on https://tl.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aklat_ng_Pahayag&oldid=1906499 . Thanks. Atn20112222 (talk) 20:33, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Now I understand. I can see the problem. I recognise the type of cover, I've owned several in the same series. That's an unfortunate and rather obvious mistake. Even so, if anyone else were to find a similar sort of link on en:wp, they would only have to delete it. Even if an editor only went around inserting this type of link in many articles, they would only get a warning, I suspect. It seems that all your other edits are completely OK. Anyway, by 10:08 (https://tl.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aklat_ng_Pahayag&oldid=1906512) you had deleted the offending entry, only the rather obvious -4,137 rather draws attention. I have no admin or any other rights on en:wp at all, I'm merely an editor. As far as I know, that would need an administrator on Tagalog Wikipedia to completely strike out the entry like in the John Seigenthaler article. There must have been some pretty serious legally-actionable vandalism going on for this to happen, The editors were banned as well. I haven't come across that sort of thing before, but I stay away from controversial articles. I could ping the relevant admin here if you like. I'm almost 100% certain that no-one on English Wikipedia or any other WP except yours would have the rights to do this, each language project has its own separate admins. Personally, I would not worry too much. I realise that the political situation in your country is a bit different from the UK. There may be a certain amount of shame involved (I have certainly done a number of silly things on WP in the past) but I would tend to forget about it. Even if what you did makes you liable in some way, no admin is going to try cover it up, just for your sake - if that is your intention. There is so much going on on any WP that a minor mistake like this (in my opinion) is really not going to be noticed. Happy editing. MinorProphet (talk) 09:40, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Profanity filter[edit] Hi all, asking for someone else. An IP posted a message on a Ref Desk page which contained the word 'suck' (all the rest of the IP's posts have been completely OK).

PrimeHunter (talk) 07:14, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Odd's bodkins, that's a busy page, literally thousands of naughty people per day. I had no idea. Thanks for your swift reply. Rather than point a finger at anyone, since I feel the IP was acting in good faith and seemed slightly shocked that a relatively mild word met with disapproval, I tracked the entry down in the log. It shows 1,053 (LTA 1053) (hidden). Would that be enough, especially if the filter contained the relevant word? Cheers, MinorProphet (talk) 09:20, 18 November 2021 (UTC) The IP didn't do anything wrong. It looks unintentional that the edit filter catches 'suck' alone in code using a regular expression to target certain longer words.

For both browsers to have the same problem seems strange, since cookies are definitely handled by the browser, not the OS afaik. I know very little about Macs. Do you ever actually log out of WP or close the browser completely (rather than leaving it minimised)? Tried leaving the browser open overnight? You could try asking at Wikipedia:Reference desk/Computing. There's several knowledgeable people there (plus yours truly, sometimes - ahem). MinorProphet (talk) 13:29, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks. I don't typically leave my desktop on overnight... I shut it down completely (as opposed to simply putting it to sleep). Thus, if I have a Wikipedia tab open, it's automatically shut down. I haven't done any upgrades to my operating system in the past 6 months so I didn't touch any settings there. I'll have to go back and check my settings in both Chrome and (although I rarely use it) Safari.

I have reverted your most recent edit to the page and warned you as you added info for a Subnautica 3 while stating there are merely rumors about it.

 It looks right to me in Firefox with identical normal spaces. I have the default Firefox font Times New Roman. DejaVu Serif is not default.

Sungodtemple (talk) 21:09, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Twenty4marc Creating a new article(not just a "page") is the hardest thing to do on Wikipedia.

Check WP:RSNP first to see if there is already consensus on it. RudolfRed (talk) 21:21, 19 November 2021 (UTC) What I mean is, what do I do about the BLP issue? I can't think of a way to explain the issue with the content, without linking it or otherwise describing the claim in some detail. 174.93.70.56 (talk) 21:25, 19 November 2021 (UTC) If the falsehoods are in an article, then challenge the content as not coming from a reliable source. If they're not in a Wikipedia article, there's nothing we can do. --Orange Mike | Talk 01:40, 20 November 2021 (UTC) I still don't think I'm being understood. I am not trying to get Wikipedia to do anything about the falsehoods. I am not trying to fix a specific Wikipedia article. The source is currently considered reliable. I am trying to advocate for a downgrade of the source's deemed reliability. I am trying to not, personally, violate BLP policy while doing so. The difficulty is that - as far as I am aware - evidencing that the source spread falsehoods requires citing them. 174.93.70.56 (talk) 13:46, 20 November 2021 (UTC) As above Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard is the correct place. You won't get into issues by linking to a page as part of a discussion, as long as you don't repeat things that might break BLP (such as commenting things about a person in such a way as to make people believe it is the truth, when it's not sourced). The very nature of the noticeboard requires that links be added, although a Facebook account is unlikely to change the reliability of a source. Best Wishes, Lee Vilenski (talk • contribs) 14:47, 20 November 2021 (UTC) To clarify: I don't mean that someone on social media told me about the falsehood; I mean that the source used social media to spread the falsehood and I saw it there. 174.93.70.56 (talk) 15:23, 20 November 2021 (UTC) November 20[edit] Wikipedia review[edit] just want to say Wikipedia is cool — Preceding unsigned comment added by 71.200.54.86 (talk) 03:13, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you for your feedback.

Victor Schmidt (talk) 06:29, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Undated Draft[edit] I submitted Draft:Red Man Laughing to AfC like I normally do, but I noticed the alerts at WP:POD indicates that the submission is "undated". Why exactly is this specific draft "undated", does it show up at AfC like the other drafts based on time since submitting, and in the future how do I make sure that any drafts I submit have a date? TipsyElephant (talk) 14:34, 20 November 2021 (UTC) I'm assuming Wikipedia: WikiProject Podcasting/Article alerts is what you are referring too. It's nothing to worry about, although I don't know where the bot gets the dates from for AfC items. Best Wishes, Lee Vilenski (talk • contribs) 14:42, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Deletion Request in Protected Talk Page[edit] Due to the protection on the page itself, I cannot report it there. Requesting the deletion of the "Murder" section of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Kenosha_unrest_shooting#Murder User ? suggests using a new definition of murder independent of legal definition and in the face of lawsuits. Rather than delete it for obvious reasons, EvergreenFir has instead engaged in discussion and suggested the main thing stopping Wikipedia from doing as much is the lawsuits. — Preceding unsigned comment added by CoreParadigm (talk • contribs) 15:15, 20 November 2021 (UTC) I don't see any issue that would merit removing the thread, other than a suggestion that is quickly rejected by other users, with OP being suggested how to better approach it. Isabelle ? 18:08, 20 November 2021 (UTC) The suggestion was to redefine what murder is so they can say murder on the page, a significantly less relevant discussion to the page itself than previous suggestions that were deleted prior to the semi-protection placed on the talk page. — Preceding unsigned comment added by CoreParadigm (talk • contribs) 18:41, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Disappearing edit?[edit] There's an edit at the almost-bottom of this section, made at 12:05 am yesterday by an IP: Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style#Proposal_E.

Is there a notification template, referring to Mr.X, that I can include in my comment? What is the Wikipedia best practice for creating such a notification in a talk page comment? Deicas (talk) 00:02, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @Deicas: Try {{reply to}} (which I have used here) or {{talkback}}. ClaudineChionh (talk – contribs) 00:06, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you for your response. Do I understand correctly that ... ... using the {{reply to}} template is equivalent to prefixing the username with an "@", eg. @ClaudineChionh? ... and use of the "@" username construct causes a notification to be delivered to username? Deicas (talk) 00:56, 17 November 2021 (UTC) {{reply to}} by default will prefix the username with "@" and append a colon. Using this template, or manually linking to the user, will notify the pinged user if they have allowed notifications. ClaudineChionh (talk – contribs) 01:02, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Using their linked username, like this Deicas (just don't copy a fancy one, because they it looks like they signed it), also serves as a ping. Note that the ping must occur as part of the original comment, and at the same time as the comment is signed and saved. Fixing it later will not work. A later ping has to be in its own signed comment, if it wasn't within the same edit as the original comment. -- Valjean (talk) 01:45, 17 November 2021 (UTC) John Bullock (1731–1809)[edit] ref number 5 is not quite right - with year of publishing etc - please help. thanks115.70.23.77 (talk) 01:17, 17 November 2021 (UTC) You could add the |year= parameter with the year of publishing.

On the page Philip Davies, the following is written in the introduction: "he is the most rebellious serving Conservative MP, having voted against the Tory whip over 250 times in the course of his parliamentary career, and he has been criticised for "talking out" Parliamentary Bills not supported by the government and by doing so "kill off legislation he doesn't like"." So, since the Conservatives have been in power since 2010, how can be Mr. Davies be called "rebellious" for voting against bills not supported by the Conservative government? This is very unclear and doesn’t appear to be phrased right. Thank you. ActiveContributor2020 (talk) 02:03, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Looking at the revision history "most rebellious" has been there since 2014. Could be time for a change. ––FormalDude talk 02:12, 17 November 2021 (UTC) It seems like 2 different things; 1) he's voted in 'opposition' to the party line the greatest number of times and 2) He's talked out bills he dislikes or not supported by the Govt. – presumably proposed by opposition parties.

Any article on your father would need to cite more than just a single source, per Wikipedia:Notability policies. And furthermore, Wikipedia isn't an appropriate place to be promoting a book written by someone from your own family, even if it concerns a hero of the Greek resistance. Please read the Wikipedia:Conflict of interest guideline. AndyTheGrump (talk) 09:11, 17 November 2021 (UTC) @MarSyDia, I assume you mean User:MarSyDia/sandbox/Pavlos Diamantis.

ClaudineChionh (talk – contribs) 13:28, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Monica, please be aware that Wikipedia does not contain "profiles" - not one. What it contains is encyclopaedia articles about notable subjects. These should be based almost entirely on what people unconnected with the subject have chosen to publish about them, not on what the subject or their associates say or want to say. --ColinFine (talk) 13:40, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Dear Colin, Could you please send met the content of the deleted page.

The correct answer is 3,137, but the search response was 5.1M!! Wikipedia's answer was correct, but the incorrect response was bolstered by claiming they got their information from "Wikipedia and others". Is their anyway you can track that down and correct it? Thanks — Preceding unsigned comment added by 2603:6011:840:548:40F6:27CE:D95A:ACFA (talk) 13:23, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Are you by any chance referring to a photo or text shown to the right of a Google search? Google's Knowledge Graph uses a wide variety of sources. There may be a text paragraph ending with "Wikipedia" to indicate that particular text was copied from Wikipedia. An image and other text before or after the Wikipedia excerpt may be from sources completely unrelated to Wikipedia. We have no control over how Google presents our information, but Google's Knowledge Graph has a "Feedback" link where anyone can mark a field as wrong. The same feedback facility is also provided on Bing and some other search engines. --ColinFine (talk) 13:42, 17 November 2021 (UTC) For curiosity, I did the same search, on Google. It seems that the IP may be misinterpreting the results they got. The 5.1 Million figure is not associated with S. Korea in my results, but a worldwide total. The results page is astonishingly obfuscatory, Google should be praised for making it so difficult to interpret!!!!!

That's a red link as I type because you haven't yet created it. However, like other red links, once you click on them you'll be allowed to do so. These pages are to describe yourself in relation to what editing you plan to do in Wikipedia (see WP:USERPAGE for details of this and related pages). It can assist other editors if you also place the same template on the Talk Page of the articles you are editing where that payment or WP:COI is relevant. Note that the advice on the COI guide says that this includes making a declaration in edit summaries when adding to articles. Mike Turnbull (talk) 15:28, 17 November 2021 (UTC) self-citing and corrections[edit] Hello. I was unable to add a question to the Talk pages and I might have done something wrong. I apologize for going about things the wrong way, but I do stand by my corrections. Here's what happened: I have just published "Francis and Clare the Struggles of the Saints of Assisi," which Kirkus Reviews said was “lucidly written, a scrupulously thorough account.” On pub date yesterday 11/16/2021 I added my book as a reference on the following entries: Francis of Assisi, Clare of Assisi, Agnes of Bohemia, Elias of Cortona, and Pope Gregory IX. I also made some corrections and added my book and page numbers as a reference on Elias of Cortona and Agnes of Bohemia. Another point: Yesterday the coding of the ISBN numbers seemed to be correct but today the ISBN number on some entries leads to the WIKI ISBN search page and does not retrieve the book. Here are the links to the pages I mention: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_of_Assisi https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clare_of_Assisi https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnes_of_Bohemia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elias_of_Cortona https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Gregory_IX Thanks for your time and assistance. I am glad to have finally found the help desk. Best wishes, Kathleen BradyKathleen Brady (talk) 15:16, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Hello, Kathleen Brady, and thank you for wanting to help improve Wikipedia. But please do not ever add a citation to your own work, as that is regarded as a conflict of interest. You are welcome to suggest adding it, by making an WP:edit request on the article's talk page, so that an uninvolved editor can decide whether or not it is appropriate to add. I don't know why you were unable to add a question: what happened when you tried?. See also SELFCITE. --ColinFine (talk) 15:43, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Actually, contrary to what ColinFine has said, it can sometimes be appropriate to cite one's own work. The guidance says Using material you have written or published is allowed within reason, but only if it is relevant, conforms to the content policies, including WP:SELFPUB, and is not excessive. With Wikipedia's WP:BRD policy, be Bold but prepared for someone to Revert: then Discuss on the Talk Page of the article. (Note that it is very rarely appropriate to directly edit an article about yourself, if one exists, but that's another topic.) Mike Turnbull (talk) 16:39, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you, Mike Turnbull. There seem to be different interpretations of the rules so I am going to remove my insertions and corrections.Kathleen Brady (talk) 12:50, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Hi, @Kathleen, thanks for bringing your in-depth subject knowledge to Wikipedia! Google Books lists [1] the ISBN of your book as 1737549808 / ISBN 9781737549802. But at Agnes of Bohemia you entered it as 978-1565482210, which appears to be The lady : Clare of Assisi : early documents by Regis J Armstrong [2]. Looking now at Clare of Assisi, it does have ISBN 978-1737549802. So I think what I stumbled on in the Agnes article is tangential to your main concern. Linking ISBNs to Special:BookSources is by design. If a book was available at multiple booksellers and libraries, who are we to direct the reader to a specific store? WorldCat [3] has an Amazon link for anyone interested in purchasing. . ? Pelagic ( messages ) 20:36, 17 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you, Pelagic. I shall address this.

ClaudineChionh (talk – contribs) 04:16, 18 November 2021 (UTC) @Lilslak: Your seem to have edited at one time in a sandbox at User:Jrobbins878/sandbox which belongs to Jrobbins878 but that was back in February, so I'm afraid recent content there or in your own sandbox is gone. The save button says "publish" to remind users that whatever they save can be seen by anyone who knows where to look and is automatically licensed as CC BY-SA 3.0. However, it is not at that stage an article in main space. Mike Turnbull (talk) 13:11, 18 November 2021 (UTC) external link in |website=[edit] I am trying to get rid of an error message that look like |website =. I'm not sure exactly what it means or how to resolve it. The link to the sandbox is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:KobiIheoma/Nancy_Boyd-Franklin?venotify=created&action=edit. The citation in question is [3]. Any help that can be given is much appreciated! KobiIheoma (talk) 04:26, 18 November 2021 (UTC) @KobiIheoma: The {{Cite web}} template can be a bit confusing because, in this case, the |website= parameter is actually used for the name of the work or publisher (see Help:Citation Style 1 § Work and publisher). In this case, "APA Div. 43: Society for Couple and Family Psychology" might be the right value. You have correctly provided the full URL in the |url= parameter.

I needed somebodys help in deleting this link to a history page of an article I'm revising and improving as nobody's able to help me in the Tagalog Wikipedia. I unwittingwly inserted a link to a copyrighted book that I was browsing while developing an article. Much appreciation to anybody who could help. https://tl.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aklat_ng_Pahayag&oldid=1906499 Atn20112222 (talk) 05:40, 18 November 2021 (UTC) This is the English Wikipedia, and I'm afraid that various people will say they can do little to help, and anyway probably no-one here speaks Tagálog. I'll have a go, although this is unusual. In general terms, the vast majority of books and journals printed since around 1930 (it varies by country) are still in copyright anyway. There's nothing wrong in referencing, or linking to, any book or journal. It's the actual reproduction of copyright material by anyone else that's the problem, not the linking to it. Obviously linking to a site with a breach of copyright (eg containing a free download of a copyright work) is not allowed. For example, the brief D. R. Hillers article on Revelation 13:18 in the reflist is freely online at Bulletin of ASOR. In fact, it's a {{cite journal}} and not a {{cite book}}, and I have updated the reference. It's great that the Tagalog Wikipedia uses the English templates! Plus a Captcha as well... The url of the Ang Pahayag kay Juan (Statement/Gospel of St. John?) gives me a warning that it's on a blacklist. I suggest that you simply delete the whole reference, leaving the main text intact. There are probably better sources for this book. The other only links with a working url are [5] which can be be reffed as Lohnes, Kate. "Siege of Jerusalem: Jewish-Roman war [70 ce]". Britannica Online. Retrieved 18 November 2021., and [6] which should be White, L. Michael. "Understanding the Book of Revelation". Frontline. Retrieved 18 November 2021. (Edit to see the code and paste into the article). I hope this may have helped: otherwise please let me know which specific link you are having trouble with. MinorProphet (talk) 10:43, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Hey there MinorProphet. I didn't make myself clear of what I wanted to happen. If you click on the link https://tl.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aklat_ng_Pahayag&oldid=1906499 , you would see a nonreference link in a subheader to a PDF file ending with https://... 8aec-03b7-426d-ab35-c8d7ac15b369.pdf. This was a mistake. I would like this article version [7] be hidden from the readers. This what I mean visually, for example , https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Seigenthaler&offset=20171127130845%7C812365719&action=history contains link versions in the history that are inaccesible and are denoted by a strikethrough 06:26, 12 September 2015. I'd like to see this 09:11, 11 Nobyembre 2021 on https://tl.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aklat_ng_Pahayag&oldid=1906499 . Thanks. Atn20112222 (talk) 20:33, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Now I understand. I can see the problem. I recognise the type of cover, I've owned several in the same series. That's an unfortunate and rather obvious mistake. Even so, if anyone else were to find a similar sort of link on en:wp, they would only have to delete it. Even if an editor only went around inserting this type of link in many articles, they would only get a warning, I suspect. It seems that all your other edits are completely OK. Anyway, by 10:08 (https://tl.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aklat_ng_Pahayag&oldid=1906512) you had deleted the offending entry, only the rather obvious -4,137 rather draws attention. I have no admin or any other rights on en:wp at all, I'm merely an editor. As far as I know, that would need an administrator on Tagalog Wikipedia to completely strike out the entry like in the John Seigenthaler article. There must have been some pretty serious legally-actionable vandalism going on for this to happen, The editors were banned as well. I haven't come across that sort of thing before, but I stay away from controversial articles. I could ping the relevant admin here if you like. I'm almost 100% certain that no-one on English Wikipedia or any other WP except yours would have the rights to do this, each language project has its own separate admins. Personally, I would not worry too much. I realise that the political situation in your country is a bit different from the UK. There may be a certain amount of shame involved (I have certainly done a number of silly things on WP in the past) but I would tend to forget about it. Even if what you did makes you liable in some way, no admin is going to try cover it up, just for your sake - if that is your intention. There is so much going on on any WP that a minor mistake like this (in my opinion) is really not going to be noticed. Happy editing. MinorProphet (talk) 09:40, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Profanity filter[edit] Hi all, asking for someone else. An IP posted a message on a Ref Desk page which contained the word 'suck' (all the rest of the IP's posts have been completely OK). They got a message (I assume one of those big red ones) that a filter determined the message was harmful. I couldn't find anything relevant, can anyone enlighten me? Cheers, MinorProphet (talk) 06:29, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Please identify the IP so their edit filter log can be examined. PrimeHunter (talk) 07:14, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Odd's bodkins, that's a busy page, literally thousands of naughty people per day. I had no idea. Thanks for your swift reply. Rather than point a finger at anyone, since I feel the IP was acting in good faith and seemed slightly shocked that a relatively mild word met with disapproval, I tracked the entry down in the log. It shows 1,053 (LTA 1053) (hidden). Would that be enough, especially if the filter contained the relevant word? Cheers, MinorProphet (talk) 09:20, 18 November 2021 (UTC) The IP didn't do anything wrong. It looks unintentional that the edit filter catches 'suck' alone in code using a regular expression to target certain longer words. I have posted to Wikipedia:Edit filter/False positives/Reports#2600:1700:d0a0:21b0:a00e:f5aa:e4e8:9861.

For both browsers to have the same problem seems strange, since cookies are definitely handled by the browser, not the OS afaik. I know very little about Macs. Do you ever actually log out of WP or close the browser completely (rather than leaving it minimised)? Tried leaving the browser open overnight? You could try asking at Wikipedia:Reference desk/Computing. There's several knowledgeable people there (plus yours truly, sometimes - ahem). MinorProphet (talk) 13:29, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks. I don't typically leave my desktop on overnight... I shut it down completely (as opposed to simply putting it to sleep). Thus, if I have a Wikipedia tab open, it's automatically shut down. I haven't done any upgrades to my operating system in the past 6 months so I didn't touch any settings there. I'll have to go back and check my settings in both Chrome and (although I rarely use it) Safari. I tried posting a message over at Reference desk/computing but was curtly told that "this has already been answered [here] at the Help Desk".

I have reverted your most recent edit to the page and warned you as you added info for a Subnautica 3 while stating there are merely rumors about it. Wikipedia does not add information solely based on rumors, if we did then a lot of false information could be added to Wikipedia simply because someone heard a rumor about it.

 It looks right to me in Firefox with identical normal spaces. I have the default Firefox font Times New Roman. DejaVu Serif is not default.

Please note that there is a mountain of policies regarding articles, and you should probably read up on that before creating the draft. Sungodtemple (talk) 21:09, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Twenty4marc Creating a new article(not just a "page") is the hardest thing to do on Wikipedia. It's usually recommended that you first edit existing articles in areas that interest you, to get a feel for how Wikipedia operates and what is expected of article content. Using the new user tutorial also is helpful. Diving right in to creating articles can lead to frustration and disappointment unless you first understand Wikipedia.

I have information that a source that is on the "frequently discussed" WP:RS list, via a satellite social media account, has published provable (and frankly embarrassing) falsehoods. The problem is that these falsehoods tend to impugn the character of a real person who is discussed on Wikipedia, in a way that is currently very politically sensitive.

I am not trying to get Wikipedia to do anything about the falsehoods. I am not trying to fix a specific Wikipedia article. The source is currently considered reliable. I am trying to advocate for a downgrade of the source's deemed reliability. I am trying to not, personally, violate BLP policy while doing so. The difficulty is that - as far as I am aware - evidencing that the source spread falsehoods requires citing them. 174.93.70.56 (talk) 13:46, 20 November 2021 (UTC) As above Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard is the correct place. You won't get into issues by linking to a page as part of a discussion, as long as you don't repeat things that might break BLP (such as commenting things about a person in such a way as to make people believe it is the truth, when it's not sourced). The very nature of the noticeboard requires that links be added, although a Facebook account is unlikely to change the reliability of a source. Best Wishes, Lee Vilenski (talk • contribs) 14:47, 20 November 2021 (UTC) To clarify: I don't mean that someone on social media told me about the falsehood; I mean that the source used social media to spread the falsehood and I saw it there. 174.93.70.56 (talk) 15:23, 20 November 2021 (UTC) November 20[edit] Wikipedia review[edit] just want to say Wikipedia is cool — Preceding unsigned comment added by 71.200.54.86 (talk) 03:13, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you for your feedback.

Victor Schmidt (talk) 06:29, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Undated Draft[edit] I submitted Draft:Red Man Laughing to AfC like I normally do, but I noticed the alerts at WP:POD indicates that the submission is "undated". Why exactly is this specific draft "undated", does it show up at AfC like the other drafts based on time since submitting, and in the future how do I make sure that any drafts I submit have a date? TipsyElephant (talk) 14:34, 20 November 2021 (UTC) I'm assuming Wikipedia: WikiProject Podcasting/Article alerts is what you are referring too.

Requesting the deletion of the "Murder" section of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Kenosha_unrest_shooting#Murder User ? suggests using a new definition of murder independent of legal definition and in the face of lawsuits. Rather than delete it for obvious reasons, EvergreenFir has instead engaged in discussion and suggested the main thing stopping Wikipedia from doing as much is the lawsuits. — Preceding unsigned comment added by CoreParadigm (talk • contribs) 15:15, 20 November 2021 (UTC) I don't see any issue that would merit removing the thread, other than a suggestion that is quickly rejected by other users, with OP being suggested how to better approach it. Isabelle ? 18:08, 20 November 2021 (UTC) The suggestion was to redefine what murder is so they can say murder on the page, a significantly less relevant discussion to the page itself than previous suggestions that were deleted prior to the semi-protection placed on the talk page. — Preceding unsigned comment added by CoreParadigm (talk • contribs) 18:41, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Disappearing edit?[edit] There's an edit at the almost-bottom of this section, made at 12:05 am yesterday by an IP: Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style#Proposal_E.

ClaudineChionh (talk – contribs) 04:16, 18 November 2021 (UTC) @Lilslak: Your seem to have edited at one time in a sandbox at User:Jrobbins878/sandbox which belongs to Jrobbins878 but that was back in February, so I'm afraid recent content there or in your own sandbox is gone. The save button says "publish" to remind users that whatever they save can be seen by anyone who knows where to look and is automatically licensed as CC BY-SA 3.0. However, it is not at that stage an article in main space. Mike Turnbull (talk) 13:11, 18 November 2021 (UTC) external link in |website=[edit] I am trying to get rid of an error message that look like |website =. I'm not sure exactly what it means or how to resolve it. The link to the sandbox is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:KobiIheoma/Nancy_Boyd-Franklin?venotify=created&action=edit. The citation in question is [3]. Any help that can be given is much appreciated! KobiIheoma (talk) 04:26, 18 November 2021 (UTC) @KobiIheoma: The {{Cite web}} template can be a bit confusing because, in this case, the |website= parameter is actually used for the name of the work or publisher (see Help:Citation Style 1 § Work and publisher). In this case, "APA Div. 43: Society for Couple and Family Psychology" might be the right value. You have correctly provided the full URL in the |url= parameter. ClaudineChionh (talk – contribs) 04:37, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Deletion of a history link[edit] HI. I needed somebodys help in deleting this link to a history page of an article I'm revising and improving as nobody's able to help me in the Tagalog Wikipedia. I unwittingwly inserted a link to a copyrighted book that I was browsing while developing an article. Much appreciation to anybody who could help. https://tl.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aklat_ng_Pahayag&oldid=1906499 Atn20112222 (talk) 05:40, 18 November 2021 (UTC) This is the English Wikipedia, and I'm afraid that various people will say they can do little to help, and anyway probably no-one here speaks Tagálog. I'll have a go, although this is unusual. In general terms, the vast majority of books and journals printed since around 1930 (it varies by country) are still in copyright anyway. There's nothing wrong in referencing, or linking to, any book or journal. It's the actual reproduction of copyright material by anyone else that's the problem, not the linking to it. Obviously linking to a site with a breach of copyright (eg containing a free download of a copyright work) is not allowed. For example, the brief D. R. Hillers article on Revelation 13:18 in the reflist is freely online at Bulletin of ASOR. In fact, it's a {{cite journal}} and not a {{cite book}}, and I have updated the reference. It's great that the Tagalog Wikipedia uses the English templates! Plus a Captcha as well... The url of the Ang Pahayag kay Juan (Statement/Gospel of St. John?) gives me a warning that it's on a blacklist. I suggest that you simply delete the whole reference, leaving the main text intact. There are probably better sources for this book. The other only links with a working url are [1] which can be be reffed as Lohnes, Kate. "Siege of Jerusalem: Jewish-Roman war [70 ce]". Britannica Online. Retrieved 18 November 2021., and [2] which should be White, L. Michael. "Understanding the Book of Revelation". Frontline. Retrieved 18 November 2021. (Edit to see the code and paste into the article). I hope this may have helped: otherwise please let me know which specific link you are having trouble with. MinorProphet (talk) 10:43, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Hey there MinorProphet. I didn't make myself clear of what I wanted to happen. If you click on the link https://tl.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aklat_ng_Pahayag&oldid=1906499 , you would see a nonreference link in a subheader to a PDF file ending with https://... 8aec-03b7-426d-ab35-c8d7ac15b369.pdf. This was a mistake. I would like this article version [3] be hidden from the readers. This what I mean visually, for example , https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Seigenthaler&offset=20171127130845%7C812365719&action=history contains link versions in the history that are inaccesible and are denoted by a strikethrough 06:26, 12 September 2015. I'd like to see this 09:11, 11 Nobyembre 2021 on https://tl.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aklat_ng_Pahayag&oldid=1906499 . Thanks. Atn20112222 (talk) 20:33, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Now I understand. I can see the problem. I recognise the type of cover, I've owned several in the same series. That's an unfortunate and rather obvious mistake. Even so, if anyone else were to find a similar sort of link on en:wp, they would only have to delete it. Even if an editor only went around inserting this type of link in many articles, they would only get a warning, I suspect. It seems that all your other edits are completely OK. Anyway, by 10:08 (https://tl.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aklat_ng_Pahayag&oldid=1906512) you had deleted the offending entry, only the rather obvious -4,137 rather draws attention. I have no admin or any other rights on en:wp at all, I'm merely an editor. As far as I know, that would need an administrator on Tagalog Wikipedia to completely strike out the entry like in the John Seigenthaler article. There must have been some pretty serious legally-actionable vandalism going on for this to happen, The editors were banned as well. I haven't come across that sort of thing before, but I stay away from controversial articles. I could ping the relevant admin here if you like. I'm almost 100% certain that no-one on English Wikipedia or any other WP except yours would have the rights to do this, each language project has its own separate admins. Personally, I would not worry too much. I realise that the political situation in your country is a bit different from the UK. There may be a certain amount of shame involved (I have certainly done a number of silly things on WP in the past) but I would tend to forget about it. Even if what you did makes you liable in some way, no admin is going to try cover it up, just for your sake - if that is your intention. There is so much going on on any WP that a minor mistake like this (in my opinion) is really not going to be noticed. Happy editing. MinorProphet (talk) 09:40, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Profanity filter[edit] Hi all, asking for someone else. An IP posted a message on a Ref Desk page which contained the word 'suck' (all the rest of the IP's posts have been completely OK). They got a message (I assume one of those big red ones) that a filter determined the message was harmful. I couldn't find anything relevant, can anyone enlighten me? Cheers, MinorProphet (talk) 06:29, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Please identify the IP so their edit filter log can be examined. PrimeHunter (talk) 07:14, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Odd's bodkins, that's a busy page, literally thousands of naughty people per day. I had no idea. Thanks for your swift reply. Rather than point a finger at anyone, since I feel the IP was acting in good faith and seemed slightly shocked that a relatively mild word met with disapproval, I tracked the entry down in the log. It shows 1,053 (LTA 1053) (hidden). Would that be enough, especially if the filter contained the relevant word? Cheers, MinorProphet (talk) 09:20, 18 November 2021 (UTC) The IP didn't do anything wrong. It looks unintentional that the edit filter catches 'suck' alone in code using a regular expression to target certain longer words. I have posted to Wikipedia:Edit filter/False positives/Reports#2600:1700:d0a0:21b0:a00e:f5aa:e4e8:9861.

PrimeHunter (talk) 11:01, 18 November 2021 (UTC) @Launch455: I can email you the content, but the subject of the draft in no way meets the notability criteria for inclusion and draft space is not a venue for hosting promotional content on "up and coming" NFTs.

For both browsers to have the same problem seems strange, since cookies are definitely handled by the browser, not the OS afaik. I know very little about Macs. Do you ever actually log out of WP or close the browser completely (rather than leaving it minimised)? Tried leaving the browser open overnight? You could try asking at Wikipedia:Reference desk/Computing. There's several knowledgeable people there (plus yours truly, sometimes - ahem). MinorProphet (talk) 13:29, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks. I don't typically leave my desktop on overnight... I shut it down completely (as opposed to simply putting it to sleep). Thus, if I have a Wikipedia tab open, it's automatically shut down. I haven't done any upgrades to my operating system in the past 6 months so I didn't touch any settings there. I'll have to go back and check my settings in both Chrome and (although I rarely use it) Safari. I tried posting a message over at Reference desk/computing but was curtly told that "this has already been answered [here] at the Help Desk".

I have reverted your most recent edit to the page and warned you as you added info for a Subnautica 3 while stating there are merely rumors about it. Wikipedia does not add information solely based on rumors, if we did then a lot of false information could be added to Wikipedia simply because someone heard a rumor about it. Information needs to be reliably sourced in order to be added to an article (with certain exceptions which I will not detail here). ? Blaze The WolfTalkBlaze Wolf#6545 16:28, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Which article title should be used[edit] Hello! For the page INAPL, should the acronym of the institution be used as the article title, should it be titled the National Institute of Anthropology and Latin American Thought, or should it use its official Spanish name: Instituto Nacional De Antropología y Pensamiento Latinoamericano? Thank you for your help, Tyrone Madera (talk) 19:00, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Per WP:UCN, generally we use the title that is most commonly used in English-language sources. If it is primarily known by the acronym, use that. There seems a strong correlation between this and FIFA, which is commonly known by the acronym for the French name. --Jayron32 19:02, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Thanks, Jayron32.

Clarityfiend (talk) 03:57, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Well, such instances can go through WP:G6, but here you probably want to keep the page history for attribution purposes.

This pic shows a tiny bit too much space is introduced by the template. (There's a fourth example in the pic; an exercise for the reader.) This second pic shows more unwanted space, presumably caused by a template that embeds {{nbsp}}. Happens on Firefox browser, but not Brave. Many (all?) pages. A CSS thing?

100&nbsp;million doses.
 It looks right to me in Firefox with identical normal spaces. I have the default Firefox font Times New Roman. DejaVu Serif is not default. If you see "Default font DejaVu Serif" in Firefox settings then it means your Firefox is set to use DejaVu Serif as the default font for text which doesn't specify a font. I don't have DejaVu Serif as a font option in Firefox 94.0.1 on Windows 10. PrimeHunter (talk) 22:28, 19 November 2021 (UTC) What article is your screenshot of? I'm wondering if there are normal spaces in there along with the nonbreak-space.

How can I create a new page? — Preceding unsigned comment added by Twenty4marc (talk • contribs) 20:52, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Twenty4marc, you currently cannot create a page directly onto Wikipedia (it requires WP:AUTOCONFIRMED rights), but you can create a draft. Please note that there is a mountain of policies regarding articles, and you should probably read up on that before creating the draft. Sungodtemple (talk) 21:09, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Twenty4marc Creating a new article(not just a "page") is the hardest thing to do on Wikipedia. It's usually recommended that you first edit existing articles in areas that interest you, to get a feel for how Wikipedia operates and what is expected of article content. Using the new user tutorial also is helpful. Diving right in to creating articles can lead to frustration and disappointment unless you first understand Wikipedia. If you still want to attempt to create a new article, please read Your First Article and then visit Articles for creation to create a draft. 331dot (talk) 21:14, 19 November 2021 (UTC) BLP vs RS?[edit] It is my understanding that WP:BLP policy applies everywhere on Wikipedia, including on talk pages, user pages and all other meta discussion. I have information that a source that is on the "frequently discussed" WP:RS list, via a satellite social media account, has published provable (and frankly embarrassing) falsehoods. The problem is that these falsehoods tend to impugn the character of a real person who is discussed on Wikipedia, in a way that is currently very politically sensitive. How can I bring up this issue properly, so that the source's reliability can be re-assessed? 174.93.70.56 (talk) 21:15, 19 November 2021 (UTC) You can post at Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard to get input on the source's reliability. Check WP:RSNP first to see if there is already consensus on it. RudolfRed (talk) 21:21, 19 November 2021 (UTC) What I mean is, what do I do about the BLP issue? I can't think of a way to explain the issue with the content, without linking it or otherwise describing the claim in some detail. 174.93.70.56 (talk) 21:25, 19 November 2021 (UTC) If the falsehoods are in an article, then challenge the content as not coming from a reliable source. If they're not in a Wikipedia article, there's nothing we can do. --Orange Mike | Talk 01:40, 20 November 2021 (UTC) I still don't think I'm being understood. I am not trying to get Wikipedia to do anything about the falsehoods. I am not trying to fix a specific Wikipedia article. The source is currently considered reliable. I am trying to advocate for a downgrade of the source's deemed reliability. I am trying to not, personally, violate BLP policy while doing so. The difficulty is that - as far as I am aware - evidencing that the source spread falsehoods requires citing them. 174.93.70.56 (talk) 13:46, 20 November 2021 (UTC) As above Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard is the correct place. You won't get into issues by linking to a page as part of a discussion, as long as you don't repeat things that might break BLP (such as commenting things about a person in such a way as to make people believe it is the truth, when it's not sourced). The very nature of the noticeboard requires that links be added, although a Facebook account is unlikely to change the reliability of a source. Best Wishes, Lee Vilenski (talk • contribs) 14:47, 20 November 2021 (UTC) To clarify: I don't mean that someone on social media told me about the falsehood; I mean that the source used social media to spread the falsehood and I saw it there. 174.93.70.56 (talk) 15:23, 20 November 2021 (UTC) November 20[edit] Wikipedia review[edit] just want to say Wikipedia is cool — Preceding unsigned comment added by 71.200.54.86 (talk) 03:13, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Thank you for your feedback.

Victor Schmidt (talk) 06:29, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Undated Draft[edit] I submitted Draft:Red Man Laughing to AfC like I normally do, but I noticed the alerts at WP:POD indicates that the submission is "undated".

TipsyElephant (talk) 14:34, 20 November 2021 (UTC) I'm assuming Wikipedia: WikiProject Podcasting/Article alerts is what you are referring too.

Requesting the deletion of the "Murder" section of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Kenosha_unrest_shooting#Murder User ? suggests using a new definition of murder independent of legal definition and in the face of lawsuits. Rather than delete it for obvious reasons, EvergreenFir has instead engaged in discussion and suggested the main thing stopping Wikipedia from doing as much is the lawsuits. — Preceding unsigned comment added by CoreParadigm (talk • contribs) 15:15, 20 November 2021 (UTC) I don't see any issue that would merit removing the thread, other than a suggestion that is quickly rejected by other users, with OP being suggested how to better approach it. Isabelle ? 18:08, 20 November 2021 (UTC) The suggestion was to redefine what murder is so they can say murder on the page, a significantly less relevant discussion to the page itself than previous suggestions that were deleted prior to the semi-protection placed on the talk page. — Preceding unsigned comment added by CoreParadigm (talk • contribs) 18:41, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Disappearing edit?[edit] There's an edit at the almost-bottom of this section, made at 12:05 am yesterday by an IP: Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style#Proposal_E. I wanted to go to this IP's talk page. But when I go to the IP's contributions, I find that they did in fact make an edit to that page at that time, but it's a different edit in a different section: Special:Contributions/2600:1702:4960:1DE0:A83C:C5D3:22C0:A90F, and that's also the only edit that shows up in the talk page history.

There seems to just be a definition -- it would be a good candidate for a soft redirect to Wiktionary. However, wikt:ichnomancy doesn't exist. Is there a standard way to move an article (or better yet, to request somebody else do the move), or should I just create a page at Wiktionary as if the Wikipedia article didn't exist? User:? (powera, ?, ?) 19:45, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Creating an entry in Wiktionary seems a good idea, if you're sure that the word meets Wiktionary's criteria for inclusion.

The prohibition on three reverts in a 24 hour period is a bright line rule but edit warring can come in many forms. Slow edit warring can take place over many days or even weeks. Making a fourth revert a few minutes after the 24 hours has passed is another type of edit warring that can be described as a variation of "gaming the system". Talk page discussions are good and edit warring is bad. Cullen328 (talk) 03:52, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Knight Skywalker Please do not be a wikilawyer. 3RR is a guideline. The policy behind the guideline is that we are an encyclopedia and we are trying to create verifiable articles based on consensus. Even (or especially) if the other party appears to you to be acting in bad faith or against consensus, you should be trying to find a path to consensus. You should not be trying to "win" because it's not supposed to be a contest in the first place. Take a look at WP:DISPUTE for some ideas. Try harder to reach consensus on the article's talk page, for example by trying to isolate any actual points in contention from extraneous cruft while identifying points of agreement. -Arch dude (talk) 04:47, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Policy advise regarding WP:DE[edit] I have a question for persons with good familiarity with Wikipedia policy about the meaning, interpretation, and enforcement mechanisms for the "[an editor who] repeatedly disregards other editors' questions or requests for explanations concerning edits or objections to edits" provision of WP:DE policy.  Where should I ask this question?

KobiIheoma (talk) 04:26, 18 November 2021 (UTC) @KobiIheoma: The {{Cite web}} template can be a bit confusing because, in this case, the |website= parameter is actually used for the name of the work or publisher (see Help:Citation Style 1 § Work and publisher). In this case, "APA Div. 43: Society for Couple and Family Psychology" might be the right value. You have correctly provided the full URL in the |url= parameter.

I needed somebodys help in deleting this link to a history page of an article I'm revising and improving as nobody's able to help me in the Tagalog Wikipedia. I unwittingwly inserted a link to a copyrighted book that I was browsing while developing an article. Much appreciation to anybody who could help. https://tl.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aklat_ng_Pahayag&oldid=1906499 Atn20112222 (talk) 05:40, 18 November 2021 (UTC) This is the English Wikipedia, and I'm afraid that various people will say they can do little to help, and anyway probably no-one here speaks Tagálog. I'll have a go, although this is unusual. In general terms, the vast majority of books and journals printed since around 1930 (it varies by country) are still in copyright anyway. There's nothing wrong in referencing, or linking to, any book or journal. It's the actual reproduction of copyright material by anyone else that's the problem, not the linking to it. Obviously linking to a site with a breach of copyright (eg containing a free download of a copyright work) is not allowed. For example, the brief D. R. Hillers article on Revelation 13:18 in the reflist is freely online at Bulletin of ASOR. In fact, it's a {{cite journal}} and not a {{cite book}}, and I have updated the reference. It's great that the Tagalog Wikipedia uses the English templates! Plus a Captcha as well... The url of the Ang Pahayag kay Juan (Statement/Gospel of St. John?) gives me a warning that it's on a blacklist. I suggest that you simply delete the whole reference, leaving the main text intact. There are probably better sources for this book. The other only links with a working url are [1] which can be be reffed as Lohnes, Kate. "Siege of Jerusalem: Jewish-Roman war [70 ce]". Britannica Online. Retrieved 18 November 2021., and [2] which should be White, L. Michael. "Understanding the Book of Revelation". Frontline. Retrieved 18 November 2021. (Edit to see the code and paste into the article). I hope this may have helped: otherwise please let me know which specific link you are having trouble with. MinorProphet (talk) 10:43, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Hey there MinorProphet. I didn't make myself clear of what I wanted to happen. If you click on the link https://tl.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aklat_ng_Pahayag&oldid=1906499 , you would see a nonreference link in a subheader to a PDF file ending with https://... 8aec-03b7-426d-ab35-c8d7ac15b369.pdf. This was a mistake. I would like this article version [3] be hidden from the readers. This what I mean visually, for example , https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Seigenthaler&offset=20171127130845%7C812365719&action=history contains link versions in the history that are inaccesible and are denoted by a strikethrough 06:26, 12 September 2015. I'd like to see this 09:11, 11 Nobyembre 2021 on https://tl.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aklat_ng_Pahayag&oldid=1906499 . Thanks. Atn20112222 (talk) 20:33, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Now I understand. I can see the problem. I recognise the type of cover, I've owned several in the same series. That's an unfortunate and rather obvious mistake. Even so, if anyone else were to find a similar sort of link on en:wp, they would only have to delete it. Even if an editor only went around inserting this type of link in many articles, they would only get a warning, I suspect. It seems that all your other edits are completely OK. Anyway, by 10:08 (https://tl.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aklat_ng_Pahayag&oldid=1906512) you had deleted the offending entry, only the rather obvious -4,137 rather draws attention. I have no admin or any other rights on en:wp at all, I'm merely an editor. As far as I know, that would need an administrator on Tagalog Wikipedia to completely strike out the entry like in the John Seigenthaler article. There must have been some pretty serious legally-actionable vandalism going on for this to happen, The editors were banned as well. I haven't come across that sort of thing before, but I stay away from controversial articles. I could ping the relevant admin here if you like. I'm almost 100% certain that no-one on English Wikipedia or any other WP except yours would have the rights to do this, each language project has its own separate admins. Personally, I would not worry too much. I realise that the political situation in your country is a bit different from the UK. There may be a certain amount of shame involved (I have certainly done a number of silly things on WP in the past) but I would tend to forget about it. Even if what you did makes you liable in some way, no admin is going to try cover it up, just for your sake - if that is your intention. There is so much going on on any WP that a minor mistake like this (in my opinion) is really not going to be noticed. Happy editing.

An IP posted a message on a Ref Desk page which contained the word 'suck' (all the rest of the IP's posts have been completely OK). They got a message (I assume one of those big red ones) that a filter determined the message was harmful. I couldn't find anything relevant, can anyone enlighten me?

PrimeHunter (talk) 07:14, 18 November 2021 (UTC) Odd's bodkins, that's a busy page, literally thousands of naughty people per day. I had no idea. Thanks for your swift reply. Rather than point a finger at anyone, since I feel the IP was acting in good faith and seemed slightly shocked that a relatively mild word met with disapproval, I tracked the entry down in the log. It shows 1,053 (LTA 1053) (hidden). Would that be enough, especially if the filter contained the relevant word? Cheers, MinorProphet (talk) 09:20, 18 November 2021 (UTC) The IP didn't do anything wrong. It looks unintentional that the edit filter catches 'suck' alone in code using a regular expression to target certain longer words.

For both browsers to have the same problem seems strange, since cookies are definitely handled by the browser, not the OS afaik. I know very little about Macs. Do you ever actually log out of WP or close the browser completely (rather than leaving it minimised)? Tried leaving the browser open overnight?

I have reverted your most recent edit to the page and warned you as you added info for a Subnautica 3 while stating there are merely rumors about it.

Sungodtemple (talk) 21:09, 19 November 2021 (UTC) Twenty4marc Creating a new article(not just a "page") is the hardest thing to do on Wikipedia. It's usually recommended that you first edit existing articles in areas that interest you, to get a feel for how Wikipedia operates and what is expected of article content. Using the new user tutorial also is helpful. Diving right in to creating articles can lead to frustration and disappointment unless you first understand Wikipedia.

I have information that a source that is on the "frequently discussed" WP:RS list, via a satellite social media account, has published provable (and frankly embarrassing) falsehoods. The problem is that these falsehoods tend to impugn the character of a real person who is discussed on Wikipedia, in a way that is currently very politically sensitive. How can I bring up this issue properly, so that the source's reliability can be re-assessed? 174.93.70.56 (talk) 21:15, 19 November 2021 (UTC) You can post at Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard to get input on the source's reliability.

I am not trying to get Wikipedia to do anything about the falsehoods. I am not trying to fix a specific Wikipedia article. The source is currently considered reliable. I am trying to advocate for a downgrade of the source's deemed reliability. I am trying to not, personally, violate BLP policy while doing so. The difficulty is that - as far as I am aware - evidencing that the source spread falsehoods requires citing them. 174.93.70.56 (talk) 13:46, 20 November 2021 (UTC) As above Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard is the correct place. You won't get into issues by linking to a page as part of a discussion, as long as you don't repeat things that might break BLP (such as commenting things about a person in such a way as to make people believe it is the truth, when it's not sourced).

Requesting the deletion of the "Murder" section of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Kenosha_unrest_shooting#Murder User ? suggests using a new definition of murder independent of legal definition and in the face of lawsuits.

There seems to just be a definition -- it would be a good candidate for a soft redirect to Wiktionary. However, wikt:ichnomancy doesn't exist. Is there a standard way to move an article (or better yet, to request somebody else do the move), or should I just create a page at Wiktionary as if the Wikipedia article didn't exist? User:?

The prohibition on three reverts in a 24 hour period is a bright line rule but edit warring can come in many forms. Slow edit warring can take place over many days or even weeks. Making a fourth revert a few minutes after the 24 hours has passed is another type of edit warring that can be described as a variation of "gaming the system". Talk page discussions are good and edit warring is bad. Cullen328 (talk) 03:52, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Knight Skywalker Please do not be a wikilawyer. 3RR is a guideline. The policy behind the guideline is that we are an encyclopedia and we are trying to create verifiable articles based on consensus. Even (or especially) if the other party appears to you to be acting in bad faith or against consensus, you should be trying to find a path to consensus. You should not be trying to "win" because it's not supposed to be a contest in the first place. Take a look at WP:DISPUTE for some ideas. Try harder to reach consensus on the article's talk page, for example by trying to isolate any actual points in contention from extraneous cruft while identifying points of agreement. -Arch dude (talk) 04:47, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Policy advise regarding WP:DE[edit] I have a question for persons with good familiarity with Wikipedia policy about the meaning, interpretation, and enforcement mechanisms for the "[an editor who] repeatedly disregards other editors' questions or requests for explanations concerning edits or objections to edits" provision of WP:DE policy.  Where should I ask this question?

First you need to read about paid editing, to understand why you should not edit the article directly; and you must make the formal declarations specified there. Then you can place an edit request on the talk page of the article in question, specifying exactly what change you are requesting to the text, and citing a reliable published source unconnected with the publication. --ColinFine (talk) 18:48, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Updating a birthday[edit] I'm trying to update a birthday on a wiki page, and it keeps not accepting it.

At a minimum, you will need a published independent reliable source with the information. You should bring this up on the article talk page. If you have access to identity documents (which you should never post in a public forum) I assume that you have a conflict of interest, please review that policy. 331dot (talk) 19:56, 22 November 2021 (UTC) A lot of the time we can simply remove the DOB if it's a living person which I guess it is. A lot of mentions of dates of birth don't comply with WP:BLPDOB relying on one or two crappy sources which even if they are reliable sources are barely reliable and definitely do not establish that the date is widely published. Nil Einne (talk) 05:19, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Wikipedia tools for key word searching, within wikipedia.org, for potentially archived talk pages, AN/I and Arbitration Committee findings[edit] I am wondering what Wikipedia tools I should use for key word searching, within wikipedia.org, through potentially archived talk pages, AN/I and Arbitration Committee findings and the like. Deicas (talk) 23:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) @Deicas: https://wikipedia.org is the common domain for all Wikipedia languages. Is that really what you mean or do you want to search the English Wikipedia at https://en.wikipedia.org? PrimeHunter (talk) 05:42, 23 November 2021 (UTC) (EC) AFAIK, wikipedia.org only exists as a redirect to www.wikipedia.org. www.wikipedia.org only exists as a tool to redirect you to the language specific subsites and also with a search bar with I think possibly only one page and it's managed via meta. Do you mean you want to search all wikipedia.org sub-sites? If so Global Search on Tool Forge which can search all Wikimedia sites. I've never used it but I guess it might allow you to search only wikipedia.org sites. I suspect it can be slow in any case. But is there any particular reason you want to search all wikipedia.org sites? What happens on other sites rarely concerns us here on en.wikipedia and many do not have arbitration committees, the may have even have something as specific as ANI. Even stuff on simple.wikipedia is generally only of limited interest. In so much as it matters, stuff on commons.wikimedia and on meta, as well as on other sites can generally be just as much of relevance as other wikipedia.org sites. Most sites don't use English so a lot of keywords aren't going to find anything anyway on most of them. If you want to search en.wikipedia or any specific site, Special:Search on that site can search it. It's available a search bar on the top right of every page on the default desktop skin, although you may need to adjust the settings to ensure it searches the namespace of interest to you. For further help on using the search function, try Help:Searching. You will be taken to the Special:Search page for the result after searching if you forget how to get there provided there isn't a clear title match (there are options in your preferences which affect matching). If there's a clear title match, you will be taken directly to the page. You can avoid this by selecting containing in the drop down list when searching. Of course you can also type something random to ensure there is no match, e.g. "I want to search all pages" is not a current title match I expect with any settings. The alternative will be to remember or book mark Special:Search. Nil Einne (talk) 05:51, 23 November 2021 (UTC) @Nil Einne & @PrimeHunter — You are correct that my interest should be in en.wikipedia.org, not wikipedia.org. I will give the search tools that you suggest a try. Thank you for your response. ——Deicas (talk) 06:02, 23 November 2021 (UTC) @Deicas: Note "Search in" at Special:Search where you can choose which namespaces to search, e.g. Talk and Wikipedia. For a single namespace you can also write the namespace and a colon in front of a search in the normal search box, e.g. wp: (using an alias for Wikipedia) .

The Wikipedia adventure is a good link to follow to get started. Also, see the guide to article creation and the article wizard will help you get started. For reference, Wikpedia does not contain 'posts' like a form of social media; it has articles on topics which pass the notability guidelines. It is a good idea to get some experience editng existing article before creating a new one which is full of pitfalls for newer editors.

If your app or your company eventually becomes notable enough to have an article (See WP:NCORP), then someone will write the article and add it to this list.

Mann Mann (talk) 16:38, 23 November 2021 (UTC) @Mann Mann: Most likely you should be able to click on the icon to bring you to its page (most likely a template). Once you're there, there's a link called "What links here" under the Tools section in the sidebar to the left, which will bring you to a page showing which pages have linked to it, including user pages.

Requesting the deletion of the "Murder" section of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Kenosha_unrest_shooting#Murder User ? suggests using a new definition of murder independent of legal definition and in the face of lawsuits. Rather than delete it for obvious reasons, EvergreenFir has instead engaged in discussion and suggested the main thing stopping Wikipedia from doing as much is the lawsuits. — Preceding unsigned comment added by CoreParadigm (talk • contribs) 15:15, 20 November 2021 (UTC) I don't see any issue that would merit removing the thread, other than a suggestion that is quickly rejected by other users, with OP being suggested how to better approach it. Isabelle ? 18:08, 20 November 2021 (UTC) The suggestion was to redefine what murder is so they can say murder on the page, a significantly less relevant discussion to the page itself than previous suggestions that were deleted prior to the semi-protection placed on the talk page. — Preceding unsigned comment added by CoreParadigm (talk • contribs) 18:41, 20 November 2021 (UTC) Disappearing edit?[edit] There's an edit at the almost-bottom of this section, made at 12:05 am yesterday by an IP: Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style#Proposal_E.

There seems to just be a definition -- it would be a good candidate for a soft redirect to Wiktionary. However, wikt:ichnomancy doesn't exist. Is there a standard way to move an article (or better yet, to request somebody else do the move), or should I just create a page at Wiktionary as if the Wikipedia article didn't exist? User:?

The prohibition on three reverts in a 24 hour period is a bright line rule but edit warring can come in many forms. Slow edit warring can take place over many days or even weeks. Making a fourth revert a few minutes after the 24 hours has passed is another type of edit warring that can be described as a variation of "gaming the system". Talk page discussions are good and edit warring is bad. Cullen328 (talk) 03:52, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Knight Skywalker Please do not be a wikilawyer. 3RR is a guideline. The policy behind the guideline is that we are an encyclopedia and we are trying to create verifiable articles based on consensus. Even (or especially) if the other party appears to you to be acting in bad faith or against consensus, you should be trying to find a path to consensus. You should not be trying to "win" because it's not supposed to be a contest in the first place. Take a look at WP:DISPUTE for some ideas. Try harder to reach consensus on the article's talk page, for example by trying to isolate any actual points in contention from extraneous cruft while identifying points of agreement. -Arch dude (talk) 04:47, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Policy advice regarding WP:DE[edit] I have a question for persons with good familiarity with Wikipedia policy about the meaning, interpretation, and enforcement mechanisms for the "[an editor who] repeatedly disregards other editors' questions or requests for explanations concerning edits or objections to edits" provision of WP:DE policy.  Where should I ask this question?

First you need to read about paid editing, to understand why you should not edit the article directly; and you must make the formal declarations specified there. Then you can place an edit request on the talk page of the article in question, specifying exactly what change you are requesting to the text, and citing a reliable published source unconnected with the publication. --ColinFine (talk) 18:48, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Updating a birthday[edit] I'm trying to update a birthday on a wiki page, and it keeps not accepting it.

At a minimum, you will need a published independent reliable source with the information. You should bring this up on the article talk page. If you have access to identity documents (which you should never post in a public forum) I assume that you have a conflict of interest, please review that policy. 331dot (talk) 19:56, 22 November 2021 (UTC) A lot of the time we can simply remove the DOB if it's a living person which I guess it is. A lot of mentions of dates of birth don't comply with WP:BLPDOB relying on one or two crappy sources which even if they are reliable sources are barely reliable and definitely do not establish that the date is widely published. Nil Einne (talk) 05:19, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Wikipedia tools for key word searching, within wikipedia.org, for potentially archived talk pages, AN/I and Arbitration Committee findings[edit] I am wondering what Wikipedia tools I should use for key word searching, within wikipedia.org, through potentially archived talk pages, AN/I and Arbitration Committee findings and the like. Deicas (talk) 23:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) @Deicas: https://wikipedia.org is the common domain for all Wikipedia languages. Is that really what you mean or do you want to search the English Wikipedia at https://en.wikipedia.org? PrimeHunter (talk) 05:42, 23 November 2021 (UTC) (EC) AFAIK, wikipedia.org only exists as a redirect to www.wikipedia.org. www.wikipedia.org only exists as a tool to redirect you to the language specific subsites and also with a search bar with I think possibly only one page and it's managed via meta. Do you mean you want to search all wikipedia.org sub-sites? If so Global Search on Tool Forge which can search all Wikimedia sites. I've never used it but I guess it might allow you to search only wikipedia.org sites. I suspect it can be slow in any case. But is there any particular reason you want to search all wikipedia.org sites? What happens on other sites rarely concerns us here on en.wikipedia and many do not have arbitration committees, the may have even have something as specific as ANI. Even stuff on simple.wikipedia is generally only of limited interest. In so much as it matters, stuff on commons.wikimedia and on meta, as well as on other sites can generally be just as much of relevance as other wikipedia.org sites. Most sites don't use English so a lot of keywords aren't going to find anything anyway on most of them. If you want to search en.wikipedia or any specific site, Special:Search on that site can search it. It's available a search bar on the top right of every page on the default desktop skin, although you may need to adjust the settings to ensure it searches the namespace of interest to you. For further help on using the search function, try Help:Searching. You will be taken to the Special:Search page for the result after searching if you forget how to get there provided there isn't a clear title match (there are options in your preferences which affect matching). If there's a clear title match, you will be taken directly to the page. You can avoid this by selecting containing in the drop down list when searching. Of course you can also type something random to ensure there is no match, e.g. "I want to search all pages" is not a current title match I expect with any settings. The alternative will be to remember or book mark Special:Search. Nil Einne (talk) 05:51, 23 November 2021 (UTC) @Nil Einne & @PrimeHunter — You are correct that my interest should be in en.wikipedia.org, not wikipedia.org. I will give the search tools that you suggest a try. Thank you for your response. ——Deicas (talk) 06:02, 23 November 2021 (UTC) @Deicas: Note "Search in" at Special:Search where you can choose which namespaces to search, e.g. Talk and Wikipedia. For a single namespace you can also write the namespace and a colon in front of a search in the normal search box, e.g. wp: (using an alias for Wikipedia) .

The Wikipedia adventure is a good link to follow to get started. Also, see the guide to article creation and the article wizard will help you get started. For reference, Wikpedia does not contain 'posts' like a form of social media; it has articles on topics which pass the notability guidelines. It is a good idea to get some experience editng existing article before creating a new one which is full of pitfalls for newer editors.

It is not a list of all such apps in the world. If your app or your company eventually becomes notable enough to have an article (See WP:NCORP), then someone will write the article and add it to this list. It is quite difficult to become notable enough for an article, and since you have a WP:COI you should not attempt to create one. -Arch dude (talk) 18:49, 23 November 2021 (UTC) List of users who have a specific top icon on their user pages[edit] I want to view a list of users who have a specific top icon on their user pages.

Mann Mann (talk) 16:38, 23 November 2021 (UTC) @Mann Mann: Most likely you should be able to click on the icon to bring you to its page (most likely a template). Once you're there, there's a link called "What links here" under the Tools section in the sidebar to the left, which will bring you to a page showing which pages have linked to it, including user pages.

The prohibition on three reverts in a 24 hour period is a bright line rule but edit warring can come in many forms. Slow edit warring can take place over many days or even weeks. Making a fourth revert a few minutes after the 24 hours has passed is another type of edit warring that can be described as a variation of "gaming the system". Talk page discussions are good and edit warring is bad. Cullen328 (talk) 03:52, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Knight Skywalker Please do not be a wikilawyer. 3RR is a guideline. The policy behind the guideline is that we are an encyclopedia and we are trying to create verifiable articles based on consensus. Even (or especially) if the other party appears to you to be acting in bad faith or against consensus, you should be trying to find a path to consensus. You should not be trying to "win" because it's not supposed to be a contest in the first place. Take a look at WP:DISPUTE for some ideas. Try harder to reach consensus on the article's talk page, for example by trying to isolate any actual points in contention from extraneous cruft while identifying points of agreement. -Arch dude (talk) 04:47, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Policy advice regarding WP:DE[edit] I have a question for persons with good familiarity with Wikipedia policy about the meaning, interpretation, and enforcement mechanisms for the "[an editor who] repeatedly disregards other editors' questions or requests for explanations concerning edits or objections to edits" provision of WP:DE policy.  Where should I ask this question?

First you need to read about paid editing, to understand why you should not edit the article directly; and you must make the formal declarations specified there. Then you can place an edit request on the talk page of the article in question, specifying exactly what change you are requesting to the text, and citing a reliable published source unconnected with the publication. --ColinFine (talk) 18:48, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Updating a birthday[edit] I'm trying to update a birthday on a wiki page, and it keeps not accepting it. I have a photo of the persons drivers license. but am unsure how to go about getting it changed as the wrong info is cited online. Any help would be appreciated. 173.252.17.63 (talk) 19:38, 22 November 2021 (UTC) We wouldn't accept a driver's licence as a source anyway (and Commons will not accept media that includes personally-identifying information). —A little blue Bori v^_^v Jéské Couriano 19:50, 22 November 2021 (UTC) If the birthdate in the article is cited, but incorrect, you may need to speak to whomever published the incorrect date to get them to issue a correction. At a minimum, you will need a published independent reliable source with the information. You should bring this up on the article talk page. If you have access to identity documents (which you should never post in a public forum) I assume that you have a conflict of interest, please review that policy. 331dot (talk) 19:56, 22 November 2021 (UTC) A lot of the time we can simply remove the DOB if it's a living person which I guess it is. A lot of mentions of dates of birth don't comply with WP:BLPDOB relying on one or two crappy sources which even if they are reliable sources are barely reliable and definitely do not establish that the date is widely published. Nil Einne (talk) 05:19, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Wikipedia tools for key word searching, within wikipedia.org, for potentially archived talk pages, AN/I and Arbitration Committee findings[edit] I am wondering what Wikipedia tools I should use for key word searching, within wikipedia.org, through potentially archived talk pages, AN/I and Arbitration Committee findings and the like. Deicas (talk) 23:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) @Deicas: https://wikipedia.org is the common domain for all Wikipedia languages. Is that really what you mean or do you want to search the English Wikipedia at https://en.wikipedia.org? PrimeHunter (talk) 05:42, 23 November 2021 (UTC) (EC) AFAIK, wikipedia.org only exists as a redirect to www.wikipedia.org. www.wikipedia.org only exists as a tool to redirect you to the language specific subsites and also with a search bar with I think possibly only one page and it's managed via meta. Do you mean you want to search all wikipedia.org sub-sites? If so Global Search on Tool Forge which can search all Wikimedia sites. I've never used it but I guess it might allow you to search only wikipedia.org sites. I suspect it can be slow in any case. But is there any particular reason you want to search all wikipedia.org sites? What happens on other sites rarely concerns us here on en.wikipedia and many do not have arbitration committees, the may have even have something as specific as ANI. Even stuff on simple.wikipedia is generally only of limited interest. In so much as it matters, stuff on commons.wikimedia and on meta, as well as on other sites can generally be just as much of relevance as other wikipedia.org sites. Most sites don't use English so a lot of keywords aren't going to find anything anyway on most of them. If you want to search en.wikipedia or any specific site, Special:Search on that site can search it. It's available a search bar on the top right of every page on the default desktop skin, although you may need to adjust the settings to ensure it searches the namespace of interest to you. For further help on using the search function, try Help:Searching. You will be taken to the Special:Search page for the result after searching if you forget how to get there provided there isn't a clear title match (there are options in your preferences which affect matching). If there's a clear title match, you will be taken directly to the page. You can avoid this by selecting containing in the drop down list when searching. Of course you can also type something random to ensure there is no match, e.g. "I want to search all pages" is not a current title match I expect with any settings. The alternative will be to remember or book mark Special:Search. Nil Einne (talk) 05:51, 23 November 2021 (UTC) @Nil Einne & @PrimeHunter — You are correct that my interest should be in en.wikipedia.org, not wikipedia.org. I will give the search tools that you suggest a try. Thank you for your response. ——Deicas (talk) 06:02, 23 November 2021 (UTC) @Deicas: Note "Search in" at Special:Search where you can choose which namespaces to search, e.g. Talk and Wikipedia. For a single namespace you can also write the namespace and a colon in front of a search in the normal search box, e.g. wp: (using an alias for Wikipedia) . PrimeHunter (talk) 06:12, 23 November 2021 (UTC) @PrimeHunter: Thanks!

The Wikipedia adventure is a good link to follow to get started. Also, see the guide to article creation and the article wizard will help you get started. For reference, Wikpedia does not contain 'posts' like a form of social media; it has articles on topics which pass the notability guidelines. It is a good idea to get some experience editng existing article before creating a new one which is full of pitfalls for newer editors.

Drafts are not formally part of the encyclopedia. I will shortly add the appropriate information to allow you to submit it- however, it would not be accepted, as it is completely unsourced.

Wikipedia is not a means of promotion. Please review Conflict of interest and paid editing. 331dot (talk) 16:39, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Wpsampathperera the list in the double ratchet algorithm article is a list of Wikipedia articles about these apps. It is not a list of all such apps in the world. If your app or your company eventually becomes notable enough to have an article (See WP:NCORP), then someone will write the article and add it to this list. It is quite difficult to become notable enough for an article, and since you have a WP:COI you should not attempt to create one. -Arch dude (talk) 18:49, 23 November 2021 (UTC) List of users who have a specific top icon on their user pages[edit] I want to view a list of users who have a specific top icon on their user pages. For example, 100 users have top icon XYZ on their user pages. Is there any way to find those 100 users? Mann Mann (talk) 16:38, 23 November 2021 (UTC) @Mann Mann: Most likely you should be able to click on the icon to bring you to its page (most likely a template). Once you're there, there's a link called "What links here" under the Tools section in the sidebar to the left, which will bring you to a page showing which pages have linked to it, including user pages. You can filter it to display only user pages by changing the namespace to User:. —Tenryuu ? ( ? • ? ) 16:47, 23 November 2021 (UTC) 1RR and cleaning up pages that are a mess?[edit] I put Palestine Solidarity Campaign up for possible deletion because it's such a mess and so heavily WP:PROMO that maybe blowing it up and starting over would be the simplest solution. It seems like it will probably survive. Several months ago, I put up a notice and talk section about the problems[3], which no one responded to. Now I'm looking at how to fix it. Would it be a violation of 1RR if I were to do a major rewrite of that page, removing large amounts of the page which are unsourced or promo? -- Bob drobbs (talk) 23:02, 23 November 2021 (UTC) I'd say no. You're not reverting a particular edit. I mean yes, some editors wrote some text and you'd technically be rewriting/removing it, but that can't be classed as a revert unless we class as reverts any edit other than those which solely add new prose (which would be a nonsensical definition). ProcrastinatingReader (talk) 23:48, 23 November 2021 (UTC) As long as you making that major rewrite as one big change, or a series of consecutive changes, 1RR does not even come into play. But if someone intervenes in your edits ,I'd wait a day , just to be on the safe side, as there are quite a few editors who would like to play "gotcha" on that sort of thing. Inf-in MD (talk) 00:09, 24 November 2021 (UTC) John Hay Munro[edit] Why is the Revision History on this article accusing me of "Possible BLP violation / Vandalism"? I was as shocked and dismayed as anyone when I Googled "John Munro", after listening to and enjoying his broadcast recently, and found that several of the first few search results had to do with charges of misconduct. The paragraph I added on the subject seemed quite relevant, if unflattering. So far as I can tell, I followed all the rules on footnoting, balanced tone, etc. Am I doomed to have that blight forever attached to the changes I made, or can an administrator remove the tag? -- 2603:6081:8004:DD5:6451:2AC4:EB73:1BE (talk) 23:56, 23 November 2021 (UTC) It's an algorithm that's guessing what you did is vandalism because you're editing from your IP, instead of from an autoconfirmed account. It's going to be forever attached to the changes you made, yes, but it's not a human judgement and it doesn't mean your edit was against the rules. It's just there to help editors quickly find vandalism on biographies of living people. If you want to avoid it in the future (and avoid having your earnest edits reverted by people with a heavy revert trigger-finger), make an account, and once you've made 10 edits and have been around for four days you won't twig that filter anymore. -- asilvering (talk) 03:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) The evil blight is attached to the IP address, not to you. In the grand scheme of things it is highly unlikely that anyone will attach it to you as a person. If you make an account, you have more control over your reputation. You can engage in discussion on your talk page about your edits and interested folks can see your responses. -Arch dude (talk) 04:26, 24 November 2021 (UTC) November 24[edit] Proper way to archive my talk page[edit] I have just returned to Wikipedia after a long hiatus, and I would like to archive my talk page for the first time. I read the archiving guide, but there was a specific question I had which I didn't see an answer for anywhere. Am I supposed to create the archive page as a new page and then cut and paste the archived discussions there, or am I supposed to actually move my talk page to User talk:Zander251/Archive 1 so that the full history of these archived discussions ends up being in the history of the archive page? In other words, should the page history remain under my talk page's name or should it be under the archive page's name? --Zander251 (talk) 03:55, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Although I (habitually, unthinkingly) do the former, Zander251, I think it's far better to do the latter, for the reason that you give. -- Hoary (talk) 05:14, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Profile edit[edit] Prpposed article content Dr. C.V.

That article is a copy of fr:Claire Fierce, which I see you have worked on - it is a legal copy, since it attribues the source. Therefore your question is actually about translating the fr-wikipedia article. See Translation for information. Note that if you translate it, you are responsible for ensuring that the sources are adequate to establish notability, and that its tone meets the requirements of en-wiki. I see the fr-wiki article has been tagged for problems of tone and notability: a translation will not be accepted into en-wiki unless it meets our criteria, which I believe are at least as strict as those of fr-wiki. --ColinFine (talk) 11:33, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Also, the French language wiki article says that it reads like a CV, which would not be acceptable on English language wiki.

The prohibition on three reverts in a 24 hour period is a bright line rule but edit warring can come in many forms. Slow edit warring can take place over many days or even weeks. Making a fourth revert a few minutes after the 24 hours has passed is another type of edit warring that can be described as a variation of "gaming the system". Talk page discussions are good and edit warring is bad. Cullen328 (talk) 03:52, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Knight Skywalker Please do not be a wikilawyer. 3RR is a guideline. The policy behind the guideline is that we are an encyclopedia and we are trying to create verifiable articles based on consensus. Even (or especially) if the other party appears to you to be acting in bad faith or against consensus, you should be trying to find a path to consensus. You should not be trying to "win" because it's not supposed to be a contest in the first place. Take a look at WP:DISPUTE for some ideas. Try harder to reach consensus on the article's talk page, for example by trying to isolate any actual points in contention from extraneous cruft while identifying points of agreement. -Arch dude (talk) 04:47, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Policy advice regarding WP:DE[edit] I have a question for persons with good familiarity with Wikipedia policy about the meaning, interpretation, and enforcement mechanisms for the "[an editor who] repeatedly disregards other editors' questions or requests for explanations concerning edits or objections to edits" provision of WP:DE policy.  Where should I ask this question?

Deicas (talk) 23:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) @Deicas: https://wikipedia.org is the common domain for all Wikipedia languages. Is that really what you mean or do you want to search the English Wikipedia at https://en.wikipedia.org? PrimeHunter (talk) 05:42, 23 November 2021 (UTC) (EC) AFAIK, wikipedia.org only exists as a redirect to www.wikipedia.org. www.wikipedia.org only exists as a tool to redirect you to the language specific subsites and also with a search bar with I think possibly only one page and it's managed via meta. Do you mean you want to search all wikipedia.org sub-sites? If so Global Search on Tool Forge which can search all Wikimedia sites. I've never used it but I guess it might allow you to search only wikipedia.org sites. I suspect it can be slow in any case. But is there any particular reason you want to search all wikipedia.org sites? What happens on other sites rarely concerns us here on en.wikipedia and many do not have arbitration committees, the may have even have something as specific as ANI. Even stuff on simple.wikipedia is generally only of limited interest. In so much as it matters, stuff on commons.wikimedia and on meta, as well as on other sites can generally be just as much of relevance as other wikipedia.org sites. Most sites don't use English so a lot of keywords aren't going to find anything anyway on most of them. If you want to search en.wikipedia or any specific site, Special:Search on that site can search it. It's available a search bar on the top right of every page on the default desktop skin, although you may need to adjust the settings to ensure it searches the namespace of interest to you. For further help on using the search function, try Help:Searching. You will be taken to the Special:Search page for the result after searching if you forget how to get there provided there isn't a clear title match (there are options in your preferences which affect matching). If there's a clear title match, you will be taken directly to the page. You can avoid this by selecting containing in the drop down list when searching. Of course you can also type something random to ensure there is no match, e.g. "I want to search all pages" is not a current title match I expect with any settings. The alternative will be to remember or book mark Special:Search. Nil Einne (talk) 05:51, 23 November 2021 (UTC) @Nil Einne & @PrimeHunter — You are correct that my interest should be in en.wikipedia.org, not wikipedia.org. I will give the search tools that you suggest a try. Thank you for your response. ——Deicas (talk) 06:02, 23 November 2021 (UTC) @Deicas: Note "Search in" at Special:Search where you can choose which namespaces to search, e.g. Talk and Wikipedia. For a single namespace you can also write the namespace and a colon in front of a search in the normal search box, e.g. wp: (using an alias for Wikipedia) .

If your app or your company eventually becomes notable enough to have an article (See WP:NCORP), then someone will write the article and add it to this list.

You're not reverting a particular edit. I mean yes, some editors wrote some text and you'd technically be rewriting/removing it, but that can't be classed as a revert unless we class as reverts any edit other than those which solely add new prose (which would be a nonsensical definition). ProcrastinatingReader (talk) 23:48, 23 November 2021 (UTC) As long as you making that major rewrite as one big change, or a series of consecutive changes, 1RR does not even come into play.

It's going to be forever attached to the changes you made, yes, but it's not a human judgement and it doesn't mean your edit was against the rules. It's just there to help editors quickly find vandalism on biographies of living people. If you want to avoid it in the future (and avoid having your earnest edits reverted by people with a heavy revert trigger-finger), make an account, and once you've made 10 edits and have been around for four days you won't twig that filter anymore. -- asilvering (talk) 03:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) The evil blight is attached to the IP address, not to you.

That article is a copy of fr:Claire Fierce, which I see you have worked on - it is a legal copy, since it attribues the source.

Note that if you translate it, you are responsible for ensuring that the sources are adequate to establish notability, and that its tone meets the requirements of en-wiki. I see the fr-wiki article has been tagged for problems of tone and notability: a translation will not be accepted into en-wiki unless it meets our criteria, which I believe are at least as strict as those of fr-wiki. --ColinFine (talk) 11:33, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Also, the French language wiki article says that it reads like a CV, which would not be acceptable on English language wiki.

So, after 24 hours, the same revert is fine? https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Knight_Skywalker&oldid=1055581558 Where did I make mistakes in my edits here? https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Forced_conversion_of_minority_girls_in_Pakistan&action=history There is also an administrator's noticeboard for edit-war, where editors are blocked. --Knight Skywalker (talk) 03:42, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Hello, Knight Skywalker. The prohibition on three reverts in a 24 hour period is a bright line rule but edit warring can come in many forms. Slow edit warring can take place over many days or even weeks. Making a fourth revert a few minutes after the 24 hours has passed is another type of edit warring that can be described as a variation of "gaming the system". Talk page discussions are good and edit warring is bad. Cullen328 (talk) 03:52, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Knight Skywalker Please do not be a wikilawyer. 3RR is a guideline. The policy behind the guideline is that we are an encyclopedia and we are trying to create verifiable articles based on consensus. Even (or especially) if the other party appears to you to be acting in bad faith or against consensus, you should be trying to find a path to consensus. You should not be trying to "win" because it's not supposed to be a contest in the first place. Take a look at WP:DISPUTE for some ideas. Try harder to reach consensus on the article's talk page, for example by trying to isolate any actual points in contention from extraneous cruft while identifying points of agreement. -Arch dude (talk) 04:47, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Policy advice regarding WP:DE[edit] I have a question for persons with good familiarity with Wikipedia policy about the meaning, interpretation, and enforcement mechanisms for the "[an editor who] repeatedly disregards other editors' questions or requests for explanations concerning edits or objections to edits" provision of WP:DE policy.  Where should I ask this question?

Thank you. Eagleash (talk) 11:17, 22 November 2021 (UTC) To move pages, you need to have an autoconfirmed account (4 days old and 10 edits). Looks like your post above was the 10th edit, which was why you were then able to move the page.

First you need to read about paid editing, to understand why you should not edit the article directly; and you must make the formal declarations specified there. Then you can place an edit request on the talk page of the article in question, specifying exactly what change you are requesting to the text, and citing a reliable published source unconnected with the publication. --ColinFine (talk) 18:48, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Updating a birthday[edit] I'm trying to update a birthday on a wiki page, and it keeps not accepting it.

Any help would be appreciated. 173.252.17.63 (talk) 19:38, 22 November 2021 (UTC) We wouldn't accept a driver's licence as a source anyway (and Commons will not accept media that includes personally-identifying information). —A little blue Bori v^_^v Jéské Couriano 19:50, 22 November 2021 (UTC) If the birthdate in the article is cited, but incorrect, you may need to speak to whomever published the incorrect date to get them to issue a correction. At a minimum, you will need a published independent reliable source with the information. You should bring this up on the article talk page. If you have access to identity documents (which you should never post in a public forum) I assume that you have a conflict of interest, please review that policy. 331dot (talk) 19:56, 22 November 2021 (UTC) A lot of the time we can simply remove the DOB if it's a living person which I guess it is. A lot of mentions of dates of birth don't comply with WP:BLPDOB relying on one or two crappy sources which even if they are reliable sources are barely reliable and definitely do not establish that the date is widely published. Nil Einne (talk) 05:19, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Wikipedia tools for key word searching, within wikipedia.org, for potentially archived talk pages, AN/I and Arbitration Committee findings[edit] I am wondering what Wikipedia tools I should use for key word searching, within wikipedia.org, through potentially archived talk pages, AN/I and Arbitration Committee findings and the like. Deicas (talk) 23:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) @Deicas: https://wikipedia.org is the common domain for all Wikipedia languages. Is that really what you mean or do you want to search the English Wikipedia at https://en.wikipedia.org? PrimeHunter (talk) 05:42, 23 November 2021 (UTC) (EC) AFAIK, wikipedia.org only exists as a redirect to www.wikipedia.org. www.wikipedia.org only exists as a tool to redirect you to the language specific subsites and also with a search bar with I think possibly only one page and it's managed via meta. Do you mean you want to search all wikipedia.org sub-sites? If so Global Search on Tool Forge which can search all Wikimedia sites. I've never used it but I guess it might allow you to search only wikipedia.org sites. I suspect it can be slow in any case. But is there any particular reason you want to search all wikipedia.org sites? What happens on other sites rarely concerns us here on en.wikipedia and many do not have arbitration committees, the may have even have something as specific as ANI. Even stuff on simple.wikipedia is generally only of limited interest. In so much as it matters, stuff on commons.wikimedia and on meta, as well as on other sites can generally be just as much of relevance as other wikipedia.org sites. Most sites don't use English so a lot of keywords aren't going to find anything anyway on most of them. If you want to search en.wikipedia or any specific site, Special:Search on that site can search it. It's available a search bar on the top right of every page on the default desktop skin, although you may need to adjust the settings to ensure it searches the namespace of interest to you. For further help on using the search function, try Help:Searching. You will be taken to the Special:Search page for the result after searching if you forget how to get there provided there isn't a clear title match (there are options in your preferences which affect matching). If there's a clear title match, you will be taken directly to the page. You can avoid this by selecting containing in the drop down list when searching. Of course you can also type something random to ensure there is no match, e.g. "I want to search all pages" is not a current title match I expect with any settings. The alternative will be to remember or book mark Special:Search. Nil Einne (talk) 05:51, 23 November 2021 (UTC) @Nil Einne & @PrimeHunter — You are correct that my interest should be in en.wikipedia.org, not wikipedia.org. I will give the search tools that you suggest a try. Thank you for your response. ——Deicas (talk) 06:02, 23 November 2021 (UTC) @Deicas: Note "Search in" at Special:Search where you can choose which namespaces to search, e.g. Talk and Wikipedia. For a single namespace you can also write the namespace and a colon in front of a search in the normal search box, e.g. wp: (using an alias for Wikipedia) . PrimeHunter (talk) 06:12, 23 November 2021 (UTC) @PrimeHunter: Thanks! I'll give it a try. --Deicas (talk) 07:22, 23 November 2021 (UTC) November 23[edit] Page Creator[edit] Is there a tool like the AfD Stats that instead allows me to see what pages I or another user has created?

The Wikipedia adventure is a good link to follow to get started. Also, see the guide to article creation and the article wizard will help you get started. For reference, Wikpedia does not contain 'posts' like a form of social media; it has articles on topics which pass the notability guidelines. It is a good idea to get some experience editng existing article before creating a new one which is full of pitfalls for newer editors.

Please review Conflict of interest and paid editing. 331dot (talk) 16:39, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Wpsampathperera the list in the double ratchet algorithm article is a list of Wikipedia articles about these apps. It is not a list of all such apps in the world. If your app or your company eventually becomes notable enough to have an article (See WP:NCORP), then someone will write the article and add it to this list. It is quite difficult to become notable enough for an article, and since you have a WP:COI you should not attempt to create one. -Arch dude (talk) 18:49, 23 November 2021 (UTC) List of users who have a specific top icon on their user pages[edit] I want to view a list of users who have a specific top icon on their user pages. For example, 100 users have top icon XYZ on their user pages. Is there any way to find those 100 users? Mann Mann (talk) 16:38, 23 November 2021 (UTC) @Mann Mann: Most likely you should be able to click on the icon to bring you to its page (most likely a template). Once you're there, there's a link called "What links here" under the Tools section in the sidebar to the left, which will bring you to a page showing which pages have linked to it, including user pages. You can filter it to display only user pages by changing the namespace to User:. —Tenryuu ? ( ? • ? ) 16:47, 23 November 2021 (UTC) 1RR and cleaning up pages that are a mess?[edit] I put Palestine Solidarity Campaign up for possible deletion because it's such a mess and so heavily WP:PROMO that maybe blowing it up and starting over would be the simplest solution. It seems like it will probably survive. Several months ago, I put up a notice and talk section about the problems[3], which no one responded to. Now I'm looking at how to fix it. Would it be a violation of 1RR if I were to do a major rewrite of that page, removing large amounts of the page which are unsourced or promo? -- Bob drobbs (talk) 23:02, 23 November 2021 (UTC) I'd say no. You're not reverting a particular edit. I mean yes, some editors wrote some text and you'd technically be rewriting/removing it, but that can't be classed as a revert unless we class as reverts any edit other than those which solely add new prose (which would be a nonsensical definition). ProcrastinatingReader (talk) 23:48, 23 November 2021 (UTC) As long as you making that major rewrite as one big change, or a series of consecutive changes, 1RR does not even come into play. But if someone intervenes in your edits ,I'd wait a day , just to be on the safe side, as there are quite a few editors who would like to play "gotcha" on that sort of thing. Inf-in MD (talk) 00:09, 24 November 2021 (UTC) John Hay Munro[edit] Why is the Revision History on this article accusing me of "Possible BLP violation / Vandalism"? I was as shocked and dismayed as anyone when I Googled "John Munro", after listening to and enjoying his broadcast recently, and found that several of the first few search results had to do with charges of misconduct. The paragraph I added on the subject seemed quite relevant, if unflattering. So far as I can tell, I followed all the rules on footnoting, balanced tone, etc. Am I doomed to have that blight forever attached to the changes I made, or can an administrator remove the tag? -- 2603:6081:8004:DD5:6451:2AC4:EB73:1BE (talk) 23:56, 23 November 2021 (UTC) It's an algorithm that's guessing what you did is vandalism because you're editing from your IP, instead of from an autoconfirmed account. It's going to be forever attached to the changes you made, yes, but it's not a human judgement and it doesn't mean your edit was against the rules. It's just there to help editors quickly find vandalism on biographies of living people. If you want to avoid it in the future (and avoid having your earnest edits reverted by people with a heavy revert trigger-finger), make an account, and once you've made 10 edits and have been around for four days you won't twig that filter anymore. -- asilvering (talk) 03:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) The evil blight is attached to the IP address, not to you. In the grand scheme of things it is highly unlikely that anyone will attach it to you as a person. If you make an account, you have more control over your reputation. You can engage in discussion on your talk page about your edits and interested folks can see your responses. -Arch dude (talk) 04:26, 24 November 2021 (UTC) November 24[edit] Proper way to archive my talk page[edit] I have just returned to Wikipedia after a long hiatus, and I would like to archive my talk page for the first time. I read the archiving guide, but there was a specific question I had which I didn't see an answer for anywhere. Am I supposed to create the archive page as a new page and then cut and paste the archived discussions there, or am I supposed to actually move my talk page to User talk:Zander251/Archive 1 so that the full history of these archived discussions ends up being in the history of the archive page? In other words, should the page history remain under my talk page's name or should it be under the archive page's name? --Zander251 (talk) 03:55, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Although I (habitually, unthinkingly) do the former, Zander251, I think it's far better to do the latter, for the reason that you give. -- Hoary (talk) 05:14, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Profile edit[edit] Prpposed article content Dr. C.V.

Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a publicity outlet. -- Hoary (talk) 05:12, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Unable to edit the profile of C.

Please kindly help me with this — Preceding unsigned comment added by Ananda Bose (talk • contribs) 05:32, 24 November 2021 (UTC) @Ananda Bose: You have been told above that Wikipedia is not a place for promotional content like CVs. Please find another website, possibly social media, to do so. —Tenryuu ? ( ? • ? ) 06:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) translating user scripts/tools/etc.[edit] Hello, if I want to use some user script or tool or template on other language Wikipedia, do I only need to attribute the author? or, I need their permission as well?

(Talk | contribs) 09:22, 24 November 2021 (UTC) EDIT PAGE FROM TRANSLATION WIKIMONDE[edit] Hi, I would like to translate this page : https://wikimonde.com/article/Claire_Fierce to the English wikipedia. how can I do that ? thanks — Preceding unsigned comment added by Blumps342898T (talk • contribs) 09:27, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Hello, Blumps342898T. That article is a copy of fr:Claire Fierce, which I see you have worked on - it is a legal copy, since it attribues the source. Therefore your question is actually about translating the fr-wikipedia article. See Translation for information. Note that if you translate it, you are responsible for ensuring that the sources are adequate to establish notability, and that its tone meets the requirements of en-wiki. I see the fr-wiki article has been tagged for problems of tone and notability: a translation will not be accepted into en-wiki unless it meets our criteria, which I believe are at least as strict as those of fr-wiki. --ColinFine (talk) 11:33, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Also, the French language wiki article says that it reads like a CV, which would not be acceptable on English language wiki. Joseph2302 (talk) 11:44, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Is there a template tag to add to articles or Reference sections to indicate the links are dead?[edit] I thought it was the linkrot template, but that seems to be for bare urls. --Fishermansworf (talk) 16:36, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Fishermansworf Template:Dead link sounds like what you want. Joseph2302 (talk) 16:41, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, thank you! --Fishermansworf (talk) 18:35, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Wisconsin Parade Murders[edit] If you want to call this slaughter a car or parade incident, you can. However, instead of making donations to Wikipedia (which I have done for years), I will laugh when asked and give you nothing. If this incident is watered down due to political correctness, then you are no longer a place for honest information, but rather you are just a joke. — Preceding unsigned comment added by 68.134.148.84 (talk) 21:12, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Wikipedia donations have no effect on the content whatsoever. The donations do not go to Wikipedia editors but instead to the WikiMedia Foundation who keep the servers up and running. None of the people who edit Wikipedia either receive any of the donations, know who has donated, or make any sort of decision based on the donations. JIP | Talk 21:15, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Ignore them. All that twitters is not bold. —A little blue Bori v^_^v Jéské Couriano 21:16, 24 November 2021 (UTC) IP user, if you are interested in a civil, collaborative discussion where a consensus is arrived at after a discussion, I invite you to participate. If you are just here to rant about alleged "political correctness", you should do that somewhere else. Donations are just that- donations- and you are free to donate or refrain from donating using whatever criteria you see fit, irrspective of how accurate it is. I would suggest that you read WP:TRUTH. 331dot (talk) 21:43, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Theatre[edit] For theatre Section should i use the year that the actors acted it or the date that the play was written?

So, after 24 hours, the same revert is fine? https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Knight_Skywalker&oldid=1055581558 Where did I make mistakes in my edits here? https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Forced_conversion_of_minority_girls_in_Pakistan&action=history There is also an administrator's noticeboard for edit-war, where editors are blocked. --Knight Skywalker (talk) 03:42, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Hello, Knight Skywalker. The prohibition on three reverts in a 24 hour period is a bright line rule but edit warring can come in many forms. Slow edit warring can take place over many days or even weeks. Making a fourth revert a few minutes after the 24 hours has passed is another type of edit warring that can be described as a variation of "gaming the system". Talk page discussions are good and edit warring is bad. Cullen328 (talk) 03:52, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Knight Skywalker Please do not be a wikilawyer. 3RR is a guideline. The policy behind the guideline is that we are an encyclopedia and we are trying to create verifiable articles based on consensus. Even (or especially) if the other party appears to you to be acting in bad faith or against consensus, you should be trying to find a path to consensus. You should not be trying to "win" because it's not supposed to be a contest in the first place. Take a look at WP:DISPUTE for some ideas. Try harder to reach consensus on the article's talk page, for example by trying to isolate any actual points in contention from extraneous cruft while identifying points of agreement. -Arch dude (talk) 04:47, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Policy advice regarding WP:DE[edit] I have a question for persons with good familiarity with Wikipedia policy about the meaning, interpretation, and enforcement mechanisms for the "[an editor who] repeatedly disregards other editors' questions or requests for explanations concerning edits or objections to edits" provision of WP:DE policy.  Where should I ask this question? Deicas (talk) 05:05, 21 November 2021 (UTC) You could ask at Wikipedia talk:Disruptive editing? DonIago (talk) 05:13, 21 November 2021 (UTC) @Doniago — Thank you.

I will use it for quick reference? — Preceding unsigned comment added by Muslim789 (talk • contribs) 07:25, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Muslim789 Don't be worried about following all the rules. Most of them are common sense things. We don't expect everyone to know all the rules(there are a lot). Just be willing to adjust your behavior if a rule is pointed out to you. The best thing to be aware of is the Five Pillars of Wikipedia. There is also a simplified rule list at this page. 331dot (talk) 07:34, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Muslim789, please see Help: Cheatsheet. Cullen328 (talk) 07:43, 21 November 2021 (UTC) I gave them the Big Graphic Welcome (template welcomeg), which covers a heck of a lot of what you need to know. --Orange Mike | Talk 19:08, 21 November 2021 (UTC) @Muslim789: There's Wikipedia:List of policies and guidelines, which doesn't really function as a cheatsheet but contains a handy set of links to the "rules".

We certainly aren't going to help with that, since Wikipedia isn't a platform for free advertising.

Thank you. Eagleash (talk) 11:17, 22 November 2021 (UTC) To move pages, you need to have an autoconfirmed account (4 days old and 10 edits). Looks like your post above was the 10th edit, which was why you were then able to move the page.

First you need to read about paid editing, to understand why you should not edit the article directly; and you must make the formal declarations specified there. Then you can place an edit request on the talk page of the article in question, specifying exactly what change you are requesting to the text, and citing a reliable published source unconnected with the publication. --ColinFine (talk) 18:48, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Updating a birthday[edit] I'm trying to update a birthday on a wiki page, and it keeps not accepting it. I have a photo of the persons drivers license. but am unsure how to go about getting it changed as the wrong info is cited online. Any help would be appreciated. 173.252.17.63 (talk) 19:38, 22 November 2021 (UTC) We wouldn't accept a driver's licence as a source anyway (and Commons will not accept media that includes personally-identifying information). —A little blue Bori v^_^v Jéské Couriano 19:50, 22 November 2021 (UTC) If the birthdate in the article is cited, but incorrect, you may need to speak to whomever published the incorrect date to get them to issue a correction. At a minimum, you will need a published independent reliable source with the information. You should bring this up on the article talk page. If you have access to identity documents (which you should never post in a public forum) I assume that you have a conflict of interest, please review that policy. 331dot (talk) 19:56, 22 November 2021 (UTC) A lot of the time we can simply remove the DOB if it's a living person which I guess it is. A lot of mentions of dates of birth don't comply with WP:BLPDOB relying on one or two crappy sources which even if they are reliable sources are barely reliable and definitely do not establish that the date is widely published. Nil Einne (talk) 05:19, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Wikipedia tools for key word searching, within wikipedia.org, for potentially archived talk pages, AN/I and Arbitration Committee findings[edit] I am wondering what Wikipedia tools I should use for key word searching, within wikipedia.org, through potentially archived talk pages, AN/I and Arbitration Committee findings and the like. Deicas (talk) 23:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) @Deicas: https://wikipedia.org is the common domain for all Wikipedia languages. Is that really what you mean or do you want to search the English Wikipedia at https://en.wikipedia.org? PrimeHunter (talk) 05:42, 23 November 2021 (UTC) (EC) AFAIK, wikipedia.org only exists as a redirect to www.wikipedia.org. www.wikipedia.org only exists as a tool to redirect you to the language specific subsites and also with a search bar with I think possibly only one page and it's managed via meta. Do you mean you want to search all wikipedia.org sub-sites? If so Global Search on Tool Forge which can search all Wikimedia sites. I've never used it but I guess it might allow you to search only wikipedia.org sites. I suspect it can be slow in any case. But is there any particular reason you want to search all wikipedia.org sites? What happens on other sites rarely concerns us here on en.wikipedia and many do not have arbitration committees, the may have even have something as specific as ANI. Even stuff on simple.wikipedia is generally only of limited interest. In so much as it matters, stuff on commons.wikimedia and on meta, as well as on other sites can generally be just as much of relevance as other wikipedia.org sites. Most sites don't use English so a lot of keywords aren't going to find anything anyway on most of them. If you want to search en.wikipedia or any specific site, Special:Search on that site can search it. It's available a search bar on the top right of every page on the default desktop skin, although you may need to adjust the settings to ensure it searches the namespace of interest to you. For further help on using the search function, try Help:Searching. You will be taken to the Special:Search page for the result after searching if you forget how to get there provided there isn't a clear title match (there are options in your preferences which affect matching). If there's a clear title match, you will be taken directly to the page. You can avoid this by selecting containing in the drop down list when searching. Of course you can also type something random to ensure there is no match, e.g. "I want to search all pages" is not a current title match I expect with any settings. The alternative will be to remember or book mark Special:Search. Nil Einne (talk) 05:51, 23 November 2021 (UTC) @Nil Einne & @PrimeHunter — You are correct that my interest should be in en.wikipedia.org, not wikipedia.org. I will give the search tools that you suggest a try. Thank you for your response. ——Deicas (talk) 06:02, 23 November 2021 (UTC) @Deicas: Note "Search in" at Special:Search where you can choose which namespaces to search, e.g. Talk and Wikipedia. For a single namespace you can also write the namespace and a colon in front of a search in the normal search box, e.g. wp: (using an alias for Wikipedia) . PrimeHunter (talk) 06:12, 23 November 2021 (UTC) @PrimeHunter: Thanks! I'll give it a try. --Deicas (talk) 07:22, 23 November 2021 (UTC) November 23[edit] Page Creator[edit] Is there a tool like the AfD Stats that instead allows me to see what pages I or another user has created?

For reference, Wikpedia does not contain 'posts' like a form of social media; it has articles on topics which pass the notability guidelines. It is a good idea to get some experience editng existing article before creating a new one which is full of pitfalls for newer editors. (Please remember to sign your posts on talk pages by typing four keyboard tildes like this: ~~~~.) Thank you. Eagleash (talk) 15:15, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Page submission on Eddie Gossage[edit] Last week I submitted a page on Eddie Gossage, retired racing promoter and builder of one of the world's largest stadiums, Texas Motor Speedway. I have not heard anything further and the page does not appear on Wikipedia. How do I find out bout the page's status? Thank you. — Preceding unsigned comment added by William Gossage (talk • contribs) 16:33, 23 November 2021 (UTC) William Gossage You created a draft, but did not actually submit it for review. Drafts are not formally part of the encyclopedia. I will shortly add the appropriate information to allow you to submit it- however, it would not be accepted, as it is completely unsourced. An article must summarize what independent reliable sources say about a subject. Please read Your First Article, and conflict of interest. 331dot (talk) 16:43, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Page update - double ratchet algorithm[edit] Hello, we have developed a mobile app that uses double ratchet algorithm which is being used by Cambodian Govenment. When I tried to edit the page to include my app I got a warning sayint its spam. May I know how I can add my app details? Thanks Sampath — Preceding unsigned comment added by Wpsampathperera (talk • contribs) 16:34, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Wpsampathperera The short answer is, you don't. Wikipedia is not a means of promotion. Please review Conflict of interest and paid editing. 331dot (talk) 16:39, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Wpsampathperera the list in the double ratchet algorithm article is a list of Wikipedia articles about these apps. It is not a list of all such apps in the world. If your app or your company eventually becomes notable enough to have an article (See WP:NCORP), then someone will write the article and add it to this list. It is quite difficult to become notable enough for an article, and since you have a WP:COI you should not attempt to create one. -Arch dude (talk) 18:49, 23 November 2021 (UTC) List of users who have a specific top icon on their user pages[edit] I want to view a list of users who have a specific top icon on their user pages. For example, 100 users have top icon XYZ on their user pages. Is there any way to find those 100 users? Mann Mann (talk) 16:38, 23 November 2021 (UTC) @Mann Mann: Most likely you should be able to click on the icon to bring you to its page (most likely a template). Once you're there, there's a link called "What links here" under the Tools section in the sidebar to the left, which will bring you to a page showing which pages have linked to it, including user pages. You can filter it to display only user pages by changing the namespace to User:. —Tenryuu ? ( ? • ? ) 16:47, 23 November 2021 (UTC) 1RR and cleaning up pages that are a mess?[edit] I put Palestine Solidarity Campaign up for possible deletion because it's such a mess and so heavily WP:PROMO that maybe blowing it up and starting over would be the simplest solution. It seems like it will probably survive. Several months ago, I put up a notice and talk section about the problems[3], which no one responded to. Now I'm looking at how to fix it. Would it be a violation of 1RR if I were to do a major rewrite of that page, removing large amounts of the page which are unsourced or promo? -- Bob drobbs (talk) 23:02, 23 November 2021 (UTC) I'd say no. You're not reverting a particular edit. I mean yes, some editors wrote some text and you'd technically be rewriting/removing it, but that can't be classed as a revert unless we class as reverts any edit other than those which solely add new prose (which would be a nonsensical definition). ProcrastinatingReader (talk) 23:48, 23 November 2021 (UTC) As long as you making that major rewrite as one big change, or a series of consecutive changes, 1RR does not even come into play. But if someone intervenes in your edits ,I'd wait a day , just to be on the safe side, as there are quite a few editors who would like to play "gotcha" on that sort of thing. Inf-in MD (talk) 00:09, 24 November 2021 (UTC) John Hay Munro[edit] Why is the Revision History on this article accusing me of "Possible BLP violation / Vandalism"? I was as shocked and dismayed as anyone when I Googled "John Munro", after listening to and enjoying his broadcast recently, and found that several of the first few search results had to do with charges of misconduct. The paragraph I added on the subject seemed quite relevant, if unflattering. So far as I can tell, I followed all the rules on footnoting, balanced tone, etc. Am I doomed to have that blight forever attached to the changes I made, or can an administrator remove the tag? -- 2603:6081:8004:DD5:6451:2AC4:EB73:1BE (talk) 23:56, 23 November 2021 (UTC) It's an algorithm that's guessing what you did is vandalism because you're editing from your IP, instead of from an autoconfirmed account. It's going to be forever attached to the changes you made, yes, but it's not a human judgement and it doesn't mean your edit was against the rules. It's just there to help editors quickly find vandalism on biographies of living people. If you want to avoid it in the future (and avoid having your earnest edits reverted by people with a heavy revert trigger-finger), make an account, and once you've made 10 edits and have been around for four days you won't twig that filter anymore. -- asilvering (talk) 03:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) The evil blight is attached to the IP address, not to you. In the grand scheme of things it is highly unlikely that anyone will attach it to you as a person. If you make an account, you have more control over your reputation. You can engage in discussion on your talk page about your edits and interested folks can see your responses. -Arch dude (talk) 04:26, 24 November 2021 (UTC) November 24[edit] Proper way to archive my talk page[edit] I have just returned to Wikipedia after a long hiatus, and I would like to archive my talk page for the first time. I read the archiving guide, but there was a specific question I had which I didn't see an answer for anywhere. Am I supposed to create the archive page as a new page and then cut and paste the archived discussions there, or am I supposed to actually move my talk page to User talk:Zander251/Archive 1 so that the full history of these archived discussions ends up being in the history of the archive page? In other words, should the page history remain under my talk page's name or should it be under the archive page's name? --Zander251 (talk) 03:55, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Although I (habitually, unthinkingly) do the former, Zander251, I think it's far better to do the latter, for the reason that you give. -- Hoary (talk) 05:14, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Profile edit[edit] Prpposed article content Dr. C.V.

That article is a copy of fr:Claire Fierce, which I see you have worked on - it is a legal copy, since it attribues the source. Therefore your question is actually about translating the fr-wikipedia article. See Translation for information. Note that if you translate it, you are responsible for ensuring that the sources are adequate to establish notability, and that its tone meets the requirements of en-wiki. I see the fr-wiki article has been tagged for problems of tone and notability: a translation will not be accepted into en-wiki unless it meets our criteria, which I believe are at least as strict as those of fr-wiki. --ColinFine (talk) 11:33, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Also, the French language wiki article says that it reads like a CV, which would not be acceptable on English language wiki.

The prohibition on three reverts in a 24 hour period is a bright line rule but edit warring can come in many forms. Slow edit warring can take place over many days or even weeks. Making a fourth revert a few minutes after the 24 hours has passed is another type of edit warring that can be described as a variation of "gaming the system". Talk page discussions are good and edit warring is bad. Cullen328 (talk) 03:52, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Knight Skywalker Please do not be a wikilawyer. 3RR is a guideline. The policy behind the guideline is that we are an encyclopedia and we are trying to create verifiable articles based on consensus. Even (or especially) if the other party appears to you to be acting in bad faith or against consensus, you should be trying to find a path to consensus. You should not be trying to "win" because it's not supposed to be a contest in the first place. Take a look at WP:DISPUTE for some ideas. Try harder to reach consensus on the article's talk page, for example by trying to isolate any actual points in contention from extraneous cruft while identifying points of agreement. -Arch dude (talk) 04:47, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Policy advice regarding WP:DE[edit] I have a question for persons with good familiarity with Wikipedia policy about the meaning, interpretation, and enforcement mechanisms for the "[an editor who] repeatedly disregards other editors' questions or requests for explanations concerning edits or objections to edits" provision of WP:DE policy.  Where should I ask this question?

Thank you. Eagleash (talk) 11:17, 22 November 2021 (UTC) To move pages, you need to have an autoconfirmed account (4 days old and 10 edits). Looks like your post above was the 10th edit, which was why you were then able to move the page.

First you need to read about paid editing, to understand why you should not edit the article directly; and you must make the formal declarations specified there. Then you can place an edit request on the talk page of the article in question, specifying exactly what change you are requesting to the text, and citing a reliable published source unconnected with the publication. --ColinFine (talk) 18:48, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Updating a birthday[edit] I'm trying to update a birthday on a wiki page, and it keeps not accepting it.

Any help would be appreciated. 173.252.17.63 (talk) 19:38, 22 November 2021 (UTC) We wouldn't accept a driver's licence as a source anyway (and Commons will not accept media that includes personally-identifying information). —A little blue Bori v^_^v Jéské Couriano 19:50, 22 November 2021 (UTC) If the birthdate in the article is cited, but incorrect, you may need to speak to whomever published the incorrect date to get them to issue a correction. At a minimum, you will need a published independent reliable source with the information. You should bring this up on the article talk page. If you have access to identity documents (which you should never post in a public forum) I assume that you have a conflict of interest, please review that policy. 331dot (talk) 19:56, 22 November 2021 (UTC) A lot of the time we can simply remove the DOB if it's a living person which I guess it is. A lot of mentions of dates of birth don't comply with WP:BLPDOB relying on one or two crappy sources which even if they are reliable sources are barely reliable and definitely do not establish that the date is widely published. Nil Einne (talk) 05:19, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Wikipedia tools for key word searching, within wikipedia.org, for potentially archived talk pages, AN/I and Arbitration Committee findings[edit] I am wondering what Wikipedia tools I should use for key word searching, within wikipedia.org, through potentially archived talk pages, AN/I and Arbitration Committee findings and the like. Deicas (talk) 23:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) @Deicas: https://wikipedia.org is the common domain for all Wikipedia languages. Is that really what you mean or do you want to search the English Wikipedia at https://en.wikipedia.org? PrimeHunter (talk) 05:42, 23 November 2021 (UTC) (EC) AFAIK, wikipedia.org only exists as a redirect to www.wikipedia.org. www.wikipedia.org only exists as a tool to redirect you to the language specific subsites and also with a search bar with I think possibly only one page and it's managed via meta. Do you mean you want to search all wikipedia.org sub-sites? If so Global Search on Tool Forge which can search all Wikimedia sites. I've never used it but I guess it might allow you to search only wikipedia.org sites. I suspect it can be slow in any case. But is there any particular reason you want to search all wikipedia.org sites? What happens on other sites rarely concerns us here on en.wikipedia and many do not have arbitration committees, the may have even have something as specific as ANI. Even stuff on simple.wikipedia is generally only of limited interest. In so much as it matters, stuff on commons.wikimedia and on meta, as well as on other sites can generally be just as much of relevance as other wikipedia.org sites. Most sites don't use English so a lot of keywords aren't going to find anything anyway on most of them. If you want to search en.wikipedia or any specific site, Special:Search on that site can search it. It's available a search bar on the top right of every page on the default desktop skin, although you may need to adjust the settings to ensure it searches the namespace of interest to you. For further help on using the search function, try Help:Searching. You will be taken to the Special:Search page for the result after searching if you forget how to get there provided there isn't a clear title match (there are options in your preferences which affect matching). If there's a clear title match, you will be taken directly to the page. You can avoid this by selecting containing in the drop down list when searching. Of course you can also type something random to ensure there is no match, e.g. "I want to search all pages" is not a current title match I expect with any settings. The alternative will be to remember or book mark Special:Search. Nil Einne (talk) 05:51, 23 November 2021 (UTC) @Nil Einne & @PrimeHunter — You are correct that my interest should be in en.wikipedia.org, not wikipedia.org. I will give the search tools that you suggest a try. Thank you for your response. ——Deicas (talk) 06:02, 23 November 2021 (UTC) @Deicas: Note "Search in" at Special:Search where you can choose which namespaces to search, e.g. Talk and Wikipedia. For a single namespace you can also write the namespace and a colon in front of a search in the normal search box, e.g. wp: (using an alias for Wikipedia) . PrimeHunter (talk) 06:12, 23 November 2021 (UTC) @PrimeHunter: Thanks! I'll give it a try. --Deicas (talk) 07:22, 23 November 2021 (UTC) November 23[edit] Page Creator[edit] Is there a tool like the AfD Stats that instead allows me to see what pages I or another user has created?

The Wikipedia adventure is a good link to follow to get started. Also, see the guide to article creation and the article wizard will help you get started. For reference, Wikpedia does not contain 'posts' like a form of social media; it has articles on topics which pass the notability guidelines. It is a good idea to get some experience editng existing article before creating a new one which is full of pitfalls for newer editors.

Thank you. — Preceding unsigned comment added by William Gossage (talk • contribs) 16:33, 23 November 2021 (UTC) William Gossage You created a draft, but did not actually submit it for review. Drafts are not formally part of the encyclopedia. I will shortly add the appropriate information to allow you to submit it- however, it would not be accepted, as it is completely unsourced.

Thanks Sampath — Preceding unsigned comment added by Wpsampathperera (talk • contribs) 16:34, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Wpsampathperera The short answer is, you don't. Wikipedia is not a means of promotion. Please review Conflict of interest and paid editing. 331dot (talk) 16:39, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Wpsampathperera the list in the double ratchet algorithm article is a list of Wikipedia articles about these apps. It is not a list of all such apps in the world. If your app or your company eventually becomes notable enough to have an article (See WP:NCORP), then someone will write the article and add it to this list. It is quite difficult to become notable enough for an article, and since you have a WP:COI you should not attempt to create one. -Arch dude (talk) 18:49, 23 November 2021 (UTC) List of users who have a specific top icon on their user pages[edit] I want to view a list of users who have a specific top icon on their user pages. For example, 100 users have top icon XYZ on their user pages. Is there any way to find those 100 users? Mann Mann (talk) 16:38, 23 November 2021 (UTC) @Mann Mann: Most likely you should be able to click on the icon to bring you to its page (most likely a template). Once you're there, there's a link called "What links here" under the Tools section in the sidebar to the left, which will bring you to a page showing which pages have linked to it, including user pages. You can filter it to display only user pages by changing the namespace to User:. —Tenryuu ? ( ? • ? ) 16:47, 23 November 2021 (UTC) 1RR and cleaning up pages that are a mess?[edit] I put Palestine Solidarity Campaign up for possible deletion because it's such a mess and so heavily WP:PROMO that maybe blowing it up and starting over would be the simplest solution. It seems like it will probably survive. Several months ago, I put up a notice and talk section about the problems[3], which no one responded to. Now I'm looking at how to fix it. Would it be a violation of 1RR if I were to do a major rewrite of that page, removing large amounts of the page which are unsourced or promo? -- Bob drobbs (talk) 23:02, 23 November 2021 (UTC) I'd say no. You're not reverting a particular edit. I mean yes, some editors wrote some text and you'd technically be rewriting/removing it, but that can't be classed as a revert unless we class as reverts any edit other than those which solely add new prose (which would be a nonsensical definition). ProcrastinatingReader (talk) 23:48, 23 November 2021 (UTC) As long as you making that major rewrite as one big change, or a series of consecutive changes, 1RR does not even come into play. But if someone intervenes in your edits ,I'd wait a day , just to be on the safe side, as there are quite a few editors who would like to play "gotcha" on that sort of thing. Inf-in MD (talk) 00:09, 24 November 2021 (UTC) John Hay Munro[edit] Why is the Revision History on this article accusing me of "Possible BLP violation / Vandalism"? I was as shocked and dismayed as anyone when I Googled "John Munro", after listening to and enjoying his broadcast recently, and found that several of the first few search results had to do with charges of misconduct. The paragraph I added on the subject seemed quite relevant, if unflattering. So far as I can tell, I followed all the rules on footnoting, balanced tone, etc. Am I doomed to have that blight forever attached to the changes I made, or can an administrator remove the tag? -- 2603:6081:8004:DD5:6451:2AC4:EB73:1BE (talk) 23:56, 23 November 2021 (UTC) It's an algorithm that's guessing what you did is vandalism because you're editing from your IP, instead of from an autoconfirmed account. It's going to be forever attached to the changes you made, yes, but it's not a human judgement and it doesn't mean your edit was against the rules. It's just there to help editors quickly find vandalism on biographies of living people. If you want to avoid it in the future (and avoid having your earnest edits reverted by people with a heavy revert trigger-finger), make an account, and once you've made 10 edits and have been around for four days you won't twig that filter anymore. -- asilvering (talk) 03:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) The evil blight is attached to the IP address, not to you. In the grand scheme of things it is highly unlikely that anyone will attach it to you as a person. If you make an account, you have more control over your reputation. You can engage in discussion on your talk page about your edits and interested folks can see your responses. -Arch dude (talk) 04:26, 24 November 2021 (UTC) November 24[edit] Proper way to archive my talk page[edit] I have just returned to Wikipedia after a long hiatus, and I would like to archive my talk page for the first time. I read the archiving guide, but there was a specific question I had which I didn't see an answer for anywhere. Am I supposed to create the archive page as a new page and then cut and paste the archived discussions there, or am I supposed to actually move my talk page to User talk:Zander251/Archive 1 so that the full history of these archived discussions ends up being in the history of the archive page? In other words, should the page history remain under my talk page's name or should it be under the archive page's name? --Zander251 (talk) 03:55, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Although I (habitually, unthinkingly) do the former, Zander251, I think it's far better to do the latter, for the reason that you give. -- Hoary (talk) 05:14, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Profile edit[edit] Prpposed article content Dr. C.V.

That article is a copy of fr:Claire Fierce, which I see you have worked on - it is a legal copy, since it attribues the source. Therefore your question is actually about translating the fr-wikipedia article. See Translation for information. Note that if you translate it, you are responsible for ensuring that the sources are adequate to establish notability, and that its tone meets the requirements of en-wiki. I see the fr-wiki article has been tagged for problems of tone and notability: a translation will not be accepted into en-wiki unless it meets our criteria, which I believe are at least as strict as those of fr-wiki. --ColinFine (talk) 11:33, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Also, the French language wiki article says that it reads like a CV, which would not be acceptable on English language wiki.

So, after 24 hours, the same revert is fine? https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Knight_Skywalker&oldid=1055581558 Where did I make mistakes in my edits here? https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Forced_conversion_of_minority_girls_in_Pakistan&action=history There is also an administrator's noticeboard for edit-war, where editors are blocked. --Knight Skywalker (talk) 03:42, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Hello, Knight Skywalker. The prohibition on three reverts in a 24 hour period is a bright line rule but edit warring can come in many forms. Slow edit warring can take place over many days or even weeks. Making a fourth revert a few minutes after the 24 hours has passed is another type of edit warring that can be described as a variation of "gaming the system". Talk page discussions are good and edit warring is bad. Cullen328 (talk) 03:52, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Knight Skywalker Please do not be a wikilawyer. 3RR is a guideline. The policy behind the guideline is that we are an encyclopedia and we are trying to create verifiable articles based on consensus. Even (or especially) if the other party appears to you to be acting in bad faith or against consensus, you should be trying to find a path to consensus. You should not be trying to "win" because it's not supposed to be a contest in the first place. Take a look at WP:DISPUTE for some ideas. Try harder to reach consensus on the article's talk page, for example by trying to isolate any actual points in contention from extraneous cruft while identifying points of agreement. -Arch dude (talk) 04:47, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Policy advice regarding WP:DE[edit] I have a question for persons with good familiarity with Wikipedia policy about the meaning, interpretation, and enforcement mechanisms for the "[an editor who] repeatedly disregards other editors' questions or requests for explanations concerning edits or objections to edits" provision of WP:DE policy.  Where should I ask this question?

Deicas (talk) 23:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) @Deicas: https://wikipedia.org is the common domain for all Wikipedia languages. Is that really what you mean or do you want to search the English Wikipedia at https://en.wikipedia.org? PrimeHunter (talk) 05:42, 23 November 2021 (UTC) (EC) AFAIK, wikipedia.org only exists as a redirect to www.wikipedia.org. www.wikipedia.org only exists as a tool to redirect you to the language specific subsites and also with a search bar with I think possibly only one page and it's managed via meta. Do you mean you want to search all wikipedia.org sub-sites? If so Global Search on Tool Forge which can search all Wikimedia sites. I've never used it but I guess it might allow you to search only wikipedia.org sites. I suspect it can be slow in any case. But is there any particular reason you want to search all wikipedia.org sites? What happens on other sites rarely concerns us here on en.wikipedia and many do not have arbitration committees, the may have even have something as specific as ANI. Even stuff on simple.wikipedia is generally only of limited interest. In so much as it matters, stuff on commons.wikimedia and on meta, as well as on other sites can generally be just as much of relevance as other wikipedia.org sites. Most sites don't use English so a lot of keywords aren't going to find anything anyway on most of them. If you want to search en.wikipedia or any specific site, Special:Search on that site can search it. It's available a search bar on the top right of every page on the default desktop skin, although you may need to adjust the settings to ensure it searches the namespace of interest to you. For further help on using the search function, try Help:Searching. You will be taken to the Special:Search page for the result after searching if you forget how to get there provided there isn't a clear title match (there are options in your preferences which affect matching). If there's a clear title match, you will be taken directly to the page. You can avoid this by selecting containing in the drop down list when searching. Of course you can also type something random to ensure there is no match, e.g. "I want to search all pages" is not a current title match I expect with any settings. The alternative will be to remember or book mark Special:Search. Nil Einne (talk) 05:51, 23 November 2021 (UTC) @Nil Einne & @PrimeHunter — You are correct that my interest should be in en.wikipedia.org, not wikipedia.org. I will give the search tools that you suggest a try. Thank you for your response. ——Deicas (talk) 06:02, 23 November 2021 (UTC) @Deicas: Note "Search in" at Special:Search where you can choose which namespaces to search, e.g. Talk and Wikipedia. For a single namespace you can also write the namespace and a colon in front of a search in the normal search box, e.g. wp: (using an alias for Wikipedia) .

You're not reverting a particular edit. I mean yes, some editors wrote some text and you'd technically be rewriting/removing it, but that can't be classed as a revert unless we class as reverts any edit other than those which solely add new prose (which would be a nonsensical definition). ProcrastinatingReader (talk) 23:48, 23 November 2021 (UTC) As long as you making that major rewrite as one big change, or a series of consecutive changes, 1RR does not even come into play.

It's going to be forever attached to the changes you made, yes, but it's not a human judgement and it doesn't mean your edit was against the rules. It's just there to help editors quickly find vandalism on biographies of living people. If you want to avoid it in the future (and avoid having your earnest edits reverted by people with a heavy revert trigger-finger), make an account, and once you've made 10 edits and have been around for four days you won't twig that filter anymore. -- asilvering (talk) 03:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) The evil blight is attached to the IP address, not to you.

The donations do not go to Wikipedia editors but instead to the WikiMedia Foundation who keep the servers up and running. None of the people who edit Wikipedia either receive any of the donations, know who has donated, or make any sort of decision based on the donations.

All that twitters is not bold. —A little blue Bori v^_^v Jéské Couriano 21:16, 24 November 2021 (UTC) IP user, if you are interested in a civil, collaborative discussion where a consensus is arrived at after a discussion, I invite you to participate. If you are just here to rant about alleged "political correctness", you should do that somewhere else. Donations are just that- donations- and you are free to donate or refrain from donating using whatever criteria you see fit, irrspective of how accurate it is. I would suggest that you read WP:TRUTH. 331dot (talk) 21:43, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Theatre[edit] For theatre Section should i use the year that the actors acted it or the date that the play was written?

So, after 24 hours, the same revert is fine? https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Knight_Skywalker&oldid=1055581558 Where did I make mistakes in my edits here? https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Forced_conversion_of_minority_girls_in_Pakistan&action=history There is also an administrator's noticeboard for edit-war, where editors are blocked. --Knight Skywalker (talk) 03:42, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Hello, Knight Skywalker. The prohibition on three reverts in a 24 hour period is a bright line rule but edit warring can come in many forms. Slow edit warring can take place over many days or even weeks. Making a fourth revert a few minutes after the 24 hours has passed is another type of edit warring that can be described as a variation of "gaming the system". Talk page discussions are good and edit warring is bad. Cullen328 (talk) 03:52, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Knight Skywalker Please do not be a wikilawyer. 3RR is a guideline. The policy behind the guideline is that we are an encyclopedia and we are trying to create verifiable articles based on consensus. Even (or especially) if the other party appears to you to be acting in bad faith or against consensus, you should be trying to find a path to consensus. You should not be trying to "win" because it's not supposed to be a contest in the first place. Take a look at WP:DISPUTE for some ideas. Try harder to reach consensus on the article's talk page, for example by trying to isolate any actual points in contention from extraneous cruft while identifying points of agreement. -Arch dude (talk) 04:47, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Policy advice regarding WP:DE[edit] I have a question for persons with good familiarity with Wikipedia policy about the meaning, interpretation, and enforcement mechanisms for the "[an editor who] repeatedly disregards other editors' questions or requests for explanations concerning edits or objections to edits" provision of WP:DE policy.  Where should I ask this question?

First you need to read about paid editing, to understand why you should not edit the article directly; and you must make the formal declarations specified there. Then you can place an edit request on the talk page of the article in question, specifying exactly what change you are requesting to the text, and citing a reliable published source unconnected with the publication. --ColinFine (talk) 18:48, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Updating a birthday[edit] I'm trying to update a birthday on a wiki page, and it keeps not accepting it.

At a minimum, you will need a published independent reliable source with the information. You should bring this up on the article talk page. If you have access to identity documents (which you should never post in a public forum) I assume that you have a conflict of interest, please review that policy. 331dot (talk) 19:56, 22 November 2021 (UTC) A lot of the time we can simply remove the DOB if it's a living person which I guess it is. A lot of mentions of dates of birth don't comply with WP:BLPDOB relying on one or two crappy sources which even if they are reliable sources are barely reliable and definitely do not establish that the date is widely published. Nil Einne (talk) 05:19, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Wikipedia tools for key word searching, within wikipedia.org, for potentially archived talk pages, AN/I and Arbitration Committee findings[edit] I am wondering what Wikipedia tools I should use for key word searching, within wikipedia.org, through potentially archived talk pages, AN/I and Arbitration Committee findings and the like. Deicas (talk) 23:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) @Deicas: https://wikipedia.org is the common domain for all Wikipedia languages. Is that really what you mean or do you want to search the English Wikipedia at https://en.wikipedia.org? PrimeHunter (talk) 05:42, 23 November 2021 (UTC) (EC) AFAIK, wikipedia.org only exists as a redirect to www.wikipedia.org. www.wikipedia.org only exists as a tool to redirect you to the language specific subsites and also with a search bar with I think possibly only one page and it's managed via meta. Do you mean you want to search all wikipedia.org sub-sites? If so Global Search on Tool Forge which can search all Wikimedia sites. I've never used it but I guess it might allow you to search only wikipedia.org sites. I suspect it can be slow in any case. But is there any particular reason you want to search all wikipedia.org sites? What happens on other sites rarely concerns us here on en.wikipedia and many do not have arbitration committees, the may have even have something as specific as ANI. Even stuff on simple.wikipedia is generally only of limited interest. In so much as it matters, stuff on commons.wikimedia and on meta, as well as on other sites can generally be just as much of relevance as other wikipedia.org sites. Most sites don't use English so a lot of keywords aren't going to find anything anyway on most of them. If you want to search en.wikipedia or any specific site, Special:Search on that site can search it. It's available a search bar on the top right of every page on the default desktop skin, although you may need to adjust the settings to ensure it searches the namespace of interest to you. For further help on using the search function, try Help:Searching. You will be taken to the Special:Search page for the result after searching if you forget how to get there provided there isn't a clear title match (there are options in your preferences which affect matching). If there's a clear title match, you will be taken directly to the page. You can avoid this by selecting containing in the drop down list when searching. Of course you can also type something random to ensure there is no match, e.g. "I want to search all pages" is not a current title match I expect with any settings. The alternative will be to remember or book mark Special:Search. Nil Einne (talk) 05:51, 23 November 2021 (UTC) @Nil Einne & @PrimeHunter — You are correct that my interest should be in en.wikipedia.org, not wikipedia.org. I will give the search tools that you suggest a try. Thank you for your response. ——Deicas (talk) 06:02, 23 November 2021 (UTC) @Deicas: Note "Search in" at Special:Search where you can choose which namespaces to search, e.g. Talk and Wikipedia. For a single namespace you can also write the namespace and a colon in front of a search in the normal search box, e.g. wp: (using an alias for Wikipedia) .

The Wikipedia adventure is a good link to follow to get started. Also, see the guide to article creation and the article wizard will help you get started. For reference, Wikpedia does not contain 'posts' like a form of social media; it has articles on topics which pass the notability guidelines. It is a good idea to get some experience editng existing article before creating a new one which is full of pitfalls for newer editors.

It is not a list of all such apps in the world. If your app or your company eventually becomes notable enough to have an article (See WP:NCORP), then someone will write the article and add it to this list. It is quite difficult to become notable enough for an article, and since you have a WP:COI you should not attempt to create one. -Arch dude (talk) 18:49, 23 November 2021 (UTC) List of users who have a specific top icon on their user pages[edit] I want to view a list of users who have a specific top icon on their user pages.

Mann Mann (talk) 16:38, 23 November 2021 (UTC) @Mann Mann: Most likely you should be able to click on the icon to bring you to its page (most likely a template). Once you're there, there's a link called "What links here" under the Tools section in the sidebar to the left, which will bring you to a page showing which pages have linked to it, including user pages. You can filter it to display only user pages by changing the namespace to User:. —Tenryuu ? ( ? • ? ) 16:47, 23 November 2021 (UTC) 1RR and cleaning up pages that are a mess?[edit] I put Palestine Solidarity Campaign up for possible deletion because it's such a mess and so heavily WP:PROMO that maybe blowing it up and starting over would be the simplest solution. It seems like it will probably survive. Several months ago, I put up a notice and talk section about the problems[3], which no one responded to. Now I'm looking at how to fix it. Would it be a violation of 1RR if I were to do a major rewrite of that page, removing large amounts of the page which are unsourced or promo? -- Bob drobbs (talk) 23:02, 23 November 2021 (UTC) I'd say no. You're not reverting a particular edit. I mean yes, some editors wrote some text and you'd technically be rewriting/removing it, but that can't be classed as a revert unless we class as reverts any edit other than those which solely add new prose (which would be a nonsensical definition). ProcrastinatingReader (talk) 23:48, 23 November 2021 (UTC) As long as you making that major rewrite as one big change, or a series of consecutive changes, 1RR does not even come into play. But if someone intervenes in your edits ,I'd wait a day , just to be on the safe side, as there are quite a few editors who would like to play "gotcha" on that sort of thing.

The paragraph I added on the subject seemed quite relevant, if unflattering. So far as I can tell, I followed all the rules on footnoting, balanced tone, etc. Am I doomed to have that blight forever attached to the changes I made, or can an administrator remove the tag? -- 2603:6081:8004:DD5:6451:2AC4:EB73:1BE (talk) 23:56, 23 November 2021 (UTC) It's an algorithm that's guessing what you did is vandalism because you're editing from your IP, instead of from an autoconfirmed account. It's going to be forever attached to the changes you made, yes, but it's not a human judgement and it doesn't mean your edit was against the rules. It's just there to help editors quickly find vandalism on biographies of living people. If you want to avoid it in the future (and avoid having your earnest edits reverted by people with a heavy revert trigger-finger), make an account, and once you've made 10 edits and have been around for four days you won't twig that filter anymore. -- asilvering (talk) 03:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) The evil blight is attached to the IP address, not to you. In the grand scheme of things it is highly unlikely that anyone will attach it to you as a person. If you make an account, you have more control over your reputation. You can engage in discussion on your talk page about your edits and interested folks can see your responses. -Arch dude (talk) 04:26, 24 November 2021 (UTC) November 24[edit] Proper way to archive my talk page[edit] I have just returned to Wikipedia after a long hiatus, and I would like to archive my talk page for the first time. I read the archiving guide, but there was a specific question I had which I didn't see an answer for anywhere. Am I supposed to create the archive page as a new page and then cut and paste the archived discussions there, or am I supposed to actually move my talk page to User talk:Zander251/Archive 1 so that the full history of these archived discussions ends up being in the history of the archive page? In other words, should the page history remain under my talk page's name or should it be under the archive page's name? --Zander251 (talk) 03:55, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Although I (habitually, unthinkingly) do the former, Zander251, I think it's far better to do the latter, for the reason that you give. -- Hoary (talk) 05:14, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Profile edit[edit] Prpposed article content Dr. C.V.

That article is a copy of fr:Claire Fierce, which I see you have worked on - it is a legal copy, since it attribues the source. Therefore your question is actually about translating the fr-wikipedia article. See Translation for information. Note that if you translate it, you are responsible for ensuring that the sources are adequate to establish notability, and that its tone meets the requirements of en-wiki. I see the fr-wiki article has been tagged for problems of tone and notability: a translation will not be accepted into en-wiki unless it meets our criteria, which I believe are at least as strict as those of fr-wiki. --ColinFine (talk) 11:33, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Also, the French language wiki article says that it reads like a CV, which would not be acceptable on English language wiki. Joseph2302 (talk) 11:44, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Is there a template tag to add to articles or Reference sections to indicate the links are dead?[edit] I thought it was the linkrot template, but that seems to be for bare urls. --Fishermansworf (talk) 16:36, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Fishermansworf Template:Dead link sounds like what you want.

However, instead of making donations to Wikipedia (which I have done for years), I will laugh when asked and give you nothing.

The prohibition on three reverts in a 24 hour period is a bright line rule but edit warring can come in many forms. Slow edit warring can take place over many days or even weeks. Making a fourth revert a few minutes after the 24 hours has passed is another type of edit warring that can be described as a variation of "gaming the system". Talk page discussions are good and edit warring is bad. Cullen328 (talk) 03:52, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Knight Skywalker Please do not be a wikilawyer. 3RR is a guideline. The policy behind the guideline is that we are an encyclopedia and we are trying to create verifiable articles based on consensus. Even (or especially) if the other party appears to you to be acting in bad faith or against consensus, you should be trying to find a path to consensus. You should not be trying to "win" because it's not supposed to be a contest in the first place. Take a look at WP:DISPUTE for some ideas. Try harder to reach consensus on the article's talk page, for example by trying to isolate any actual points in contention from extraneous cruft while identifying points of agreement. -Arch dude (talk) 04:47, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Policy advice regarding WP:DE[edit] I have a question for persons with good familiarity with Wikipedia policy about the meaning, interpretation, and enforcement mechanisms for the "[an editor who] repeatedly disregards other editors' questions or requests for explanations concerning edits or objections to edits" provision of WP:DE policy.  Where should I ask this question?

First you need to read about paid editing, to understand why you should not edit the article directly; and you must make the formal declarations specified there. Then you can place an edit request on the talk page of the article in question, specifying exactly what change you are requesting to the text, and citing a reliable published source unconnected with the publication. --ColinFine (talk) 18:48, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Updating a birthday[edit] I'm trying to update a birthday on a wiki page, and it keeps not accepting it.

At a minimum, you will need a published independent reliable source with the information. You should bring this up on the article talk page. If you have access to identity documents (which you should never post in a public forum) I assume that you have a conflict of interest, please review that policy. 331dot (talk) 19:56, 22 November 2021 (UTC) A lot of the time we can simply remove the DOB if it's a living person which I guess it is. A lot of mentions of dates of birth don't comply with WP:BLPDOB relying on one or two crappy sources which even if they are reliable sources are barely reliable and definitely do not establish that the date is widely published. Nil Einne (talk) 05:19, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Wikipedia tools for key word searching, within wikipedia.org, for potentially archived talk pages, AN/I and Arbitration Committee findings[edit] I am wondering what Wikipedia tools I should use for key word searching, within wikipedia.org, through potentially archived talk pages, AN/I and Arbitration Committee findings and the like. Deicas (talk) 23:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) @Deicas: https://wikipedia.org is the common domain for all Wikipedia languages. Is that really what you mean or do you want to search the English Wikipedia at https://en.wikipedia.org? PrimeHunter (talk) 05:42, 23 November 2021 (UTC) (EC) AFAIK, wikipedia.org only exists as a redirect to www.wikipedia.org. www.wikipedia.org only exists as a tool to redirect you to the language specific subsites and also with a search bar with I think possibly only one page and it's managed via meta. Do you mean you want to search all wikipedia.org sub-sites? If so Global Search on Tool Forge which can search all Wikimedia sites. I've never used it but I guess it might allow you to search only wikipedia.org sites. I suspect it can be slow in any case. But is there any particular reason you want to search all wikipedia.org sites? What happens on other sites rarely concerns us here on en.wikipedia and many do not have arbitration committees, the may have even have something as specific as ANI. Even stuff on simple.wikipedia is generally only of limited interest. In so much as it matters, stuff on commons.wikimedia and on meta, as well as on other sites can generally be just as much of relevance as other wikipedia.org sites. Most sites don't use English so a lot of keywords aren't going to find anything anyway on most of them. If you want to search en.wikipedia or any specific site, Special:Search on that site can search it. It's available a search bar on the top right of every page on the default desktop skin, although you may need to adjust the settings to ensure it searches the namespace of interest to you. For further help on using the search function, try Help:Searching. You will be taken to the Special:Search page for the result after searching if you forget how to get there provided there isn't a clear title match (there are options in your preferences which affect matching). If there's a clear title match, you will be taken directly to the page. You can avoid this by selecting containing in the drop down list when searching. Of course you can also type something random to ensure there is no match, e.g. "I want to search all pages" is not a current title match I expect with any settings. The alternative will be to remember or book mark Special:Search. Nil Einne (talk) 05:51, 23 November 2021 (UTC) @Nil Einne & @PrimeHunter — You are correct that my interest should be in en.wikipedia.org, not wikipedia.org. I will give the search tools that you suggest a try. Thank you for your response. ——Deicas (talk) 06:02, 23 November 2021 (UTC) @Deicas: Note "Search in" at Special:Search where you can choose which namespaces to search, e.g. Talk and Wikipedia. For a single namespace you can also write the namespace and a colon in front of a search in the normal search box, e.g. wp: (using an alias for Wikipedia) .

The Wikipedia adventure is a good link to follow to get started. Also, see the guide to article creation and the article wizard will help you get started. For reference, Wikpedia does not contain 'posts' like a form of social media; it has articles on topics which pass the notability guidelines. It is a good idea to get some experience editng existing article before creating a new one which is full of pitfalls for newer editors. (Please remember to sign your posts on talk pages by typing four keyboard tildes like this: ~~~~.) Thank you.

Drafts are not formally part of the encyclopedia. I will shortly add the appropriate information to allow you to submit it- however, it would not be accepted, as it is completely unsourced.

It is not a list of all such apps in the world. If your app or your company eventually becomes notable enough to have an article (See WP:NCORP), then someone will write the article and add it to this list. It is quite difficult to become notable enough for an article, and since you have a WP:COI you should not attempt to create one. -Arch dude (talk) 18:49, 23 November 2021 (UTC) List of users who have a specific top icon on their user pages[edit] I want to view a list of users who have a specific top icon on their user pages.

Mann Mann (talk) 16:38, 23 November 2021 (UTC) @Mann Mann: Most likely you should be able to click on the icon to bring you to its page (most likely a template). Once you're there, there's a link called "What links here" under the Tools section in the sidebar to the left, which will bring you to a page showing which pages have linked to it, including user pages. You can filter it to display only user pages by changing the namespace to User:. —Tenryuu ? ( ? • ? ) 16:47, 23 November 2021 (UTC) 1RR and cleaning up pages that are a mess?[edit] I put Palestine Solidarity Campaign up for possible deletion because it's such a mess and so heavily WP:PROMO that maybe blowing it up and starting over would be the simplest solution. It seems like it will probably survive. Several months ago, I put up a notice and talk section about the problems[3], which no one responded to. Now I'm looking at how to fix it. Would it be a violation of 1RR if I were to do a major rewrite of that page, removing large amounts of the page which are unsourced or promo? -- Bob drobbs (talk) 23:02, 23 November 2021 (UTC) I'd say no. You're not reverting a particular edit. I mean yes, some editors wrote some text and you'd technically be rewriting/removing it, but that can't be classed as a revert unless we class as reverts any edit other than those which solely add new prose (which would be a nonsensical definition). ProcrastinatingReader (talk) 23:48, 23 November 2021 (UTC) As long as you making that major rewrite as one big change, or a series of consecutive changes, 1RR does not even come into play. But if someone intervenes in your edits ,I'd wait a day , just to be on the safe side, as there are quite a few editors who would like to play "gotcha" on that sort of thing. Inf-in MD (talk) 00:09, 24 November 2021 (UTC) John Hay Munro[edit] Why is the Revision History on this article accusing me of "Possible BLP violation / Vandalism"? I was as shocked and dismayed as anyone when I Googled "John Munro", after listening to and enjoying his broadcast recently, and found that several of the first few search results had to do with charges of misconduct. The paragraph I added on the subject seemed quite relevant, if unflattering. So far as I can tell, I followed all the rules on footnoting, balanced tone, etc. Am I doomed to have that blight forever attached to the changes I made, or can an administrator remove the tag? -- 2603:6081:8004:DD5:6451:2AC4:EB73:1BE (talk) 23:56, 23 November 2021 (UTC) It's an algorithm that's guessing what you did is vandalism because you're editing from your IP, instead of from an autoconfirmed account. It's going to be forever attached to the changes you made, yes, but it's not a human judgement and it doesn't mean your edit was against the rules. It's just there to help editors quickly find vandalism on biographies of living people. If you want to avoid it in the future (and avoid having your earnest edits reverted by people with a heavy revert trigger-finger), make an account, and once you've made 10 edits and have been around for four days you won't twig that filter anymore. -- asilvering (talk) 03:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) The evil blight is attached to the IP address, not to you. In the grand scheme of things it is highly unlikely that anyone will attach it to you as a person. If you make an account, you have more control over your reputation. You can engage in discussion on your talk page about your edits and interested folks can see your responses. -Arch dude (talk) 04:26, 24 November 2021 (UTC) November 24[edit] Proper way to archive my talk page[edit] I have just returned to Wikipedia after a long hiatus, and I would like to archive my talk page for the first time. I read the archiving guide, but there was a specific question I had which I didn't see an answer for anywhere. Am I supposed to create the archive page as a new page and then cut and paste the archived discussions there, or am I supposed to actually move my talk page to User talk:Zander251/Archive 1 so that the full history of these archived discussions ends up being in the history of the archive page? In other words, should the page history remain under my talk page's name or should it be under the archive page's name? --Zander251 (talk) 03:55, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Although I (habitually, unthinkingly) do the former, Zander251, I think it's far better to do the latter, for the reason that you give. -- Hoary (talk) 05:14, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Profile edit[edit] Prpposed article content Dr. C.V.

That article is a copy of fr:Claire Fierce, which I see you have worked on - it is a legal copy, since it attribues the source. Therefore your question is actually about translating the fr-wikipedia article. See Translation for information. Note that if you translate it, you are responsible for ensuring that the sources are adequate to establish notability, and that its tone meets the requirements of en-wiki. I see the fr-wiki article has been tagged for problems of tone and notability: a translation will not be accepted into en-wiki unless it meets our criteria, which I believe are at least as strict as those of fr-wiki. --ColinFine (talk) 11:33, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Also, the French language wiki article says that it reads like a CV, which would not be acceptable on English language wiki.

The prohibition on three reverts in a 24 hour period is a bright line rule but edit warring can come in many forms. Slow edit warring can take place over many days or even weeks. Making a fourth revert a few minutes after the 24 hours has passed is another type of edit warring that can be described as a variation of "gaming the system". Talk page discussions are good and edit warring is bad. Cullen328 (talk) 03:52, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Knight Skywalker Please do not be a wikilawyer. 3RR is a guideline. The policy behind the guideline is that we are an encyclopedia and we are trying to create verifiable articles based on consensus. Even (or especially) if the other party appears to you to be acting in bad faith or against consensus, you should be trying to find a path to consensus. You should not be trying to "win" because it's not supposed to be a contest in the first place. Take a look at WP:DISPUTE for some ideas. Try harder to reach consensus on the article's talk page, for example by trying to isolate any actual points in contention from extraneous cruft while identifying points of agreement. -Arch dude (talk) 04:47, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Policy advice regarding WP:DE[edit] I have a question for persons with good familiarity with Wikipedia policy about the meaning, interpretation, and enforcement mechanisms for the "[an editor who] repeatedly disregards other editors' questions or requests for explanations concerning edits or objections to edits" provision of WP:DE policy.  Where should I ask this question?

First you need to read about paid editing, to understand why you should not edit the article directly; and you must make the formal declarations specified there. Then you can place an edit request on the talk page of the article in question, specifying exactly what change you are requesting to the text, and citing a reliable published source unconnected with the publication. --ColinFine (talk) 18:48, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Updating a birthday[edit] I'm trying to update a birthday on a wiki page, and it keeps not accepting it.

At a minimum, you will need a published independent reliable source with the information. You should bring this up on the article talk page. If you have access to identity documents (which you should never post in a public forum) I assume that you have a conflict of interest, please review that policy. 331dot (talk) 19:56, 22 November 2021 (UTC) A lot of the time we can simply remove the DOB if it's a living person which I guess it is. A lot of mentions of dates of birth don't comply with WP:BLPDOB relying on one or two crappy sources which even if they are reliable sources are barely reliable and definitely do not establish that the date is widely published. Nil Einne (talk) 05:19, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Wikipedia tools for key word searching, within wikipedia.org, for potentially archived talk pages, AN/I and Arbitration Committee findings[edit] I am wondering what Wikipedia tools I should use for key word searching, within wikipedia.org, through potentially archived talk pages, AN/I and Arbitration Committee findings and the like. Deicas (talk) 23:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) @Deicas: https://wikipedia.org is the common domain for all Wikipedia languages. Is that really what you mean or do you want to search the English Wikipedia at https://en.wikipedia.org? PrimeHunter (talk) 05:42, 23 November 2021 (UTC) (EC) AFAIK, wikipedia.org only exists as a redirect to www.wikipedia.org. www.wikipedia.org only exists as a tool to redirect you to the language specific subsites and also with a search bar with I think possibly only one page and it's managed via meta. Do you mean you want to search all wikipedia.org sub-sites? If so Global Search on Tool Forge which can search all Wikimedia sites. I've never used it but I guess it might allow you to search only wikipedia.org sites. I suspect it can be slow in any case. But is there any particular reason you want to search all wikipedia.org sites? What happens on other sites rarely concerns us here on en.wikipedia and many do not have arbitration committees, the may have even have something as specific as ANI. Even stuff on simple.wikipedia is generally only of limited interest. In so much as it matters, stuff on commons.wikimedia and on meta, as well as on other sites can generally be just as much of relevance as other wikipedia.org sites. Most sites don't use English so a lot of keywords aren't going to find anything anyway on most of them. If you want to search en.wikipedia or any specific site, Special:Search on that site can search it. It's available a search bar on the top right of every page on the default desktop skin, although you may need to adjust the settings to ensure it searches the namespace of interest to you. For further help on using the search function, try Help:Searching. You will be taken to the Special:Search page for the result after searching if you forget how to get there provided there isn't a clear title match (there are options in your preferences which affect matching). If there's a clear title match, you will be taken directly to the page. You can avoid this by selecting containing in the drop down list when searching. Of course you can also type something random to ensure there is no match, e.g. "I want to search all pages" is not a current title match I expect with any settings. The alternative will be to remember or book mark Special:Search. Nil Einne (talk) 05:51, 23 November 2021 (UTC) @Nil Einne & @PrimeHunter — You are correct that my interest should be in en.wikipedia.org, not wikipedia.org. I will give the search tools that you suggest a try. Thank you for your response. ——Deicas (talk) 06:02, 23 November 2021 (UTC) @Deicas: Note "Search in" at Special:Search where you can choose which namespaces to search, e.g. Talk and Wikipedia. For a single namespace you can also write the namespace and a colon in front of a search in the normal search box, e.g. wp: (using an alias for Wikipedia) . PrimeHunter (talk) 06:12, 23 November 2021 (UTC) @PrimeHunter: Thanks!

The Wikipedia adventure is a good link to follow to get started. Also, see the guide to article creation and the article wizard will help you get started. For reference, Wikpedia does not contain 'posts' like a form of social media; it has articles on topics which pass the notability guidelines. It is a good idea to get some experience editng existing article before creating a new one which is full of pitfalls for newer editors.

Drafts are not formally part of the encyclopedia. I will shortly add the appropriate information to allow you to submit it- however, it would not be accepted, as it is completely unsourced.

Wikipedia is not a means of promotion. Please review Conflict of interest and paid editing. 331dot (talk) 16:39, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Wpsampathperera the list in the double ratchet algorithm article is a list of Wikipedia articles about these apps. It is not a list of all such apps in the world. If your app or your company eventually becomes notable enough to have an article (See WP:NCORP), then someone will write the article and add it to this list. It is quite difficult to become notable enough for an article, and since you have a WP:COI you should not attempt to create one. -Arch dude (talk) 18:49, 23 November 2021 (UTC) List of users who have a specific top icon on their user pages[edit] I want to view a list of users who have a specific top icon on their user pages.

Mann Mann (talk) 16:38, 23 November 2021 (UTC) @Mann Mann: Most likely you should be able to click on the icon to bring you to its page (most likely a template). Once you're there, there's a link called "What links here" under the Tools section in the sidebar to the left, which will bring you to a page showing which pages have linked to it, including user pages. You can filter it to display only user pages by changing the namespace to User:. —Tenryuu ? ( ? • ? ) 16:47, 23 November 2021 (UTC) 1RR and cleaning up pages that are a mess?[edit] I put Palestine Solidarity Campaign up for possible deletion because it's such a mess and so heavily WP:PROMO that maybe blowing it up and starting over would be the simplest solution. It seems like it will probably survive. Several months ago, I put up a notice and talk section about the problems[3], which no one responded to. Now I'm looking at how to fix it. Would it be a violation of 1RR if I were to do a major rewrite of that page, removing large amounts of the page which are unsourced or promo? -- Bob drobbs (talk) 23:02, 23 November 2021 (UTC) I'd say no. You're not reverting a particular edit. I mean yes, some editors wrote some text and you'd technically be rewriting/removing it, but that can't be classed as a revert unless we class as reverts any edit other than those which solely add new prose (which would be a nonsensical definition). ProcrastinatingReader (talk) 23:48, 23 November 2021 (UTC) As long as you making that major rewrite as one big change, or a series of consecutive changes, 1RR does not even come into play. But if someone intervenes in your edits ,I'd wait a day , just to be on the safe side, as there are quite a few editors who would like to play "gotcha" on that sort of thing. Inf-in MD (talk) 00:09, 24 November 2021 (UTC) John Hay Munro[edit] Why is the Revision History on this article accusing me of "Possible BLP violation / Vandalism"? I was as shocked and dismayed as anyone when I Googled "John Munro", after listening to and enjoying his broadcast recently, and found that several of the first few search results had to do with charges of misconduct. The paragraph I added on the subject seemed quite relevant, if unflattering. So far as I can tell, I followed all the rules on footnoting, balanced tone, etc. Am I doomed to have that blight forever attached to the changes I made, or can an administrator remove the tag? -- 2603:6081:8004:DD5:6451:2AC4:EB73:1BE (talk) 23:56, 23 November 2021 (UTC) It's an algorithm that's guessing what you did is vandalism because you're editing from your IP, instead of from an autoconfirmed account. It's going to be forever attached to the changes you made, yes, but it's not a human judgement and it doesn't mean your edit was against the rules. It's just there to help editors quickly find vandalism on biographies of living people. If you want to avoid it in the future (and avoid having your earnest edits reverted by people with a heavy revert trigger-finger), make an account, and once you've made 10 edits and have been around for four days you won't twig that filter anymore. -- asilvering (talk) 03:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) The evil blight is attached to the IP address, not to you. In the grand scheme of things it is highly unlikely that anyone will attach it to you as a person. If you make an account, you have more control over your reputation. You can engage in discussion on your talk page about your edits and interested folks can see your responses. -Arch dude (talk) 04:26, 24 November 2021 (UTC) November 24[edit] Proper way to archive my talk page[edit] I have just returned to Wikipedia after a long hiatus, and I would like to archive my talk page for the first time. I read the archiving guide, but there was a specific question I had which I didn't see an answer for anywhere.

That article is a copy of fr:Claire Fierce, which I see you have worked on - it is a legal copy, since it attribues the source. Therefore your question is actually about translating the fr-wikipedia article. See Translation for information. Note that if you translate it, you are responsible for ensuring that the sources are adequate to establish notability, and that its tone meets the requirements of en-wiki. I see the fr-wiki article has been tagged for problems of tone and notability: a translation will not be accepted into en-wiki unless it meets our criteria, which I believe are at least as strict as those of fr-wiki. --ColinFine (talk) 11:33, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Also, the French language wiki article says that it reads like a CV, which would not be acceptable on English language wiki.

Please limit your question to either venue to avoid duplicating editor effort. —Tenryuu ? ( ? • ? ) 04:11, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Editing same article after edit-war notice and avoiding edit-war blocks.[edit] They say more than 3 reverts in 24 hours. So, after 24 hours, the same revert is fine? https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Knight_Skywalker&oldid=1055581558 Where did I make mistakes in my edits here? https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Forced_conversion_of_minority_girls_in_Pakistan&action=history There is also an administrator's noticeboard for edit-war, where editors are blocked. --Knight Skywalker (talk) 03:42, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Hello, Knight Skywalker. The prohibition on three reverts in a 24 hour period is a bright line rule but edit warring can come in many forms. Slow edit warring can take place over many days or even weeks. Making a fourth revert a few minutes after the 24 hours has passed is another type of edit warring that can be described as a variation of "gaming the system". Talk page discussions are good and edit warring is bad. Cullen328 (talk) 03:52, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Knight Skywalker Please do not be a wikilawyer. 3RR is a guideline. The policy behind the guideline is that we are an encyclopedia and we are trying to create verifiable articles based on consensus. Even (or especially) if the other party appears to you to be acting in bad faith or against consensus, you should be trying to find a path to consensus. You should not be trying to "win" because it's not supposed to be a contest in the first place. Take a look at WP:DISPUTE for some ideas. Try harder to reach consensus on the article's talk page, for example by trying to isolate any actual points in contention from extraneous cruft while identifying points of agreement. -Arch dude (talk) 04:47, 21 November 2021 (UTC) Policy advice regarding WP:DE[edit] I have a question for persons with good familiarity with Wikipedia policy about the meaning, interpretation, and enforcement mechanisms for the "[an editor who] repeatedly disregards other editors' questions or requests for explanations concerning edits or objections to edits" provision of WP:DE policy.  Where should I ask this question?

First you need to read about paid editing, to understand why you should not edit the article directly; and you must make the formal declarations specified there. Then you can place an edit request on the talk page of the article in question, specifying exactly what change you are requesting to the text, and citing a reliable published source unconnected with the publication. --ColinFine (talk) 18:48, 22 November 2021 (UTC) Updating a birthday[edit] I'm trying to update a birthday on a wiki page, and it keeps not accepting it.

At a minimum, you will need a published independent reliable source with the information. You should bring this up on the article talk page. If you have access to identity documents (which you should never post in a public forum) I assume that you have a conflict of interest, please review that policy. 331dot (talk) 19:56, 22 November 2021 (UTC) A lot of the time we can simply remove the DOB if it's a living person which I guess it is. A lot of mentions of dates of birth don't comply with WP:BLPDOB relying on one or two crappy sources which even if they are reliable sources are barely reliable and definitely do not establish that the date is widely published. Nil Einne (talk) 05:19, 23 November 2021 (UTC) Wikipedia tools for key word searching, within wikipedia.org, for potentially archived talk pages, AN/I and Arbitration Committee findings[edit] I am wondering what Wikipedia tools I should use for key word searching, within wikipedia.org, through potentially archived talk pages, AN/I and Arbitration Committee findings and the like. Deicas (talk) 23:33, 22 November 2021 (UTC) @Deicas: https://wikipedia.org is the common domain for all Wikipedia languages. Is that really what you mean or do you want to search the English Wikipedia at https://en.wikipedia.org? PrimeHunter (talk) 05:42, 23 November 2021 (UTC) (EC) AFAIK, wikipedia.org only exists as a redirect to www.wikipedia.org. www.wikipedia.org only exists as a tool to redirect you to the language specific subsites and also with a search bar with I think possibly only one page and it's managed via meta. Do you mean you want to search all wikipedia.org sub-sites? If so Global Search on Tool Forge which can search all Wikimedia sites. I've never used it but I guess it might allow you to search only wikipedia.org sites. I suspect it can be slow in any case. But is there any particular reason you want to search all wikipedia.org sites? What happens on other sites rarely concerns us here on en.wikipedia and many do not have arbitration committees, the may have even have something as specific as ANI. Even stuff on simple.wikipedia is generally only of limited interest. In so much as it matters, stuff on commons.wikimedia and on meta, as well as on other sites can generally be just as much of relevance as other wikipedia.org sites. Most sites don't use English so a lot of keywords aren't going to find anything anyway on most of them. If you want to search en.wikipedia or any specific site, Special:Search on that site can search it. It's available a search bar on the top right of every page on the default desktop skin, although you may need to adjust the settings to ensure it searches the namespace of interest to you. For further help on using the search function, try Help:Searching. You will be taken to the Special:Search page for the result after searching if you forget how to get there provided there isn't a clear title match (there are options in your preferences which affect matching). If there's a clear title match, you will be taken directly to the page. You can avoid this by selecting containing in the drop down list when searching. Of course you can also type something random to ensure there is no match, e.g. "I want to search all pages" is not a current title match I expect with any settings. The alternative will be to remember or book mark Special:Search. Nil Einne (talk) 05:51, 23 November 2021 (UTC) @Nil Einne & @PrimeHunter — You are correct that my interest should be in en.wikipedia.org, not wikipedia.org. I will give the search tools that you suggest a try. Thank you for your response. ——Deicas (talk) 06:02, 23 November 2021 (UTC) @Deicas: Note "Search in" at Special:Search where you can choose which namespaces to search, e.g. Talk and Wikipedia. For a single namespace you can also write the namespace and a colon in front of a search in the normal search box, e.g. wp: (using an alias for Wikipedia) . PrimeHunter (talk) 06:12, 23 November 2021 (UTC) @PrimeHunter: Thanks!

The Wikipedia adventure is a good link to follow to get started. Also, see the guide to article creation and the article wizard will help you get started. For reference, Wikpedia does not contain 'posts' like a form of social media; it has articles on topics which pass the notability guidelines. It is a good idea to get some experience editng existing article before creating a new one which is full of pitfalls for newer editors.

It is not a list of all such apps in the world. If your app or your company eventually becomes notable enough to have an article (See WP:NCORP), then someone will write the article and add it to this list. It is quite difficult to become notable enough for an article, and since you have a WP:COI you should not attempt to create one. -Arch dude (talk) 18:49, 23 November 2021 (UTC) List of users who have a specific top icon on their user pages[edit] I want to view a list of users who have a specific top icon on their user pages.

Mann Mann (talk) 16:38, 23 November 2021 (UTC) @Mann Mann: Most likely you should be able to click on the icon to bring you to its page (most likely a template). Once you're there, there's a link called "What links here" under the Tools section in the sidebar to the left, which will bring you to a page showing which pages have linked to it, including user pages. You can filter it to display only user pages by changing the namespace to User:. —Tenryuu ? ( ? • ? ) 16:47, 23 November 2021 (UTC) 1RR and cleaning up pages that are a mess?[edit] I put Palestine Solidarity Campaign up for possible deletion because it's such a mess and so heavily WP:PROMO that maybe blowing it up and starting over would be the simplest solution. It seems like it will probably survive. Several months ago, I put up a notice and talk section about the problems[3], which no one responded to. Now I'm looking at how to fix it. Would it be a violation of 1RR if I were to do a major rewrite of that page, removing large amounts of the page which are unsourced or promo? -- Bob drobbs (talk) 23:02, 23 November 2021 (UTC) I'd say no. You're not reverting a particular edit. I mean yes, some editors wrote some text and you'd technically be rewriting/removing it, but that can't be classed as a revert unless we class as reverts any edit other than those which solely add new prose (which would be a nonsensical definition). ProcrastinatingReader (talk) 23:48, 23 November 2021 (UTC) As long as you making that major rewrite as one big change, or a series of consecutive changes, 1RR does not even come into play. But if someone intervenes in your edits ,I'd wait a day , just to be on the safe side, as there are quite a few editors who would like to play "gotcha" on that sort of thing. Inf-in MD (talk) 00:09, 24 November 2021 (UTC) John Hay Munro[edit] Why is the Revision History on this article accusing me of "Possible BLP violation / Vandalism"? I was as shocked and dismayed as anyone when I Googled "John Munro", after listening to and enjoying his broadcast recently, and found that several of the first few search results had to do with charges of misconduct. The paragraph I added on the subject seemed quite relevant, if unflattering. So far as I can tell, I followed all the rules on footnoting, balanced tone, etc. Am I doomed to have that blight forever attached to the changes I made, or can an administrator remove the tag? -- 2603:6081:8004:DD5:6451:2AC4:EB73:1BE (talk) 23:56, 23 November 2021 (UTC) It's an algorithm that's guessing what you did is vandalism because you're editing from your IP, instead of from an autoconfirmed account. It's going to be forever attached to the changes you made, yes, but it's not a human judgement and it doesn't mean your edit was against the rules. It's just there to help editors quickly find vandalism on biographies of living people. If you want to avoid it in the future (and avoid having your earnest edits reverted by people with a heavy revert trigger-finger), make an account, and once you've made 10 edits and have been around for four days you won't twig that filter anymore. -- asilvering (talk) 03:37, 24 November 2021 (UTC) The evil blight is attached to the IP address, not to you. In the grand scheme of things it is highly unlikely that anyone will attach it to you as a person. If you make an account, you have more control over your reputation. You can engage in discussion on your talk page about your edits and interested folks can see your responses. -Arch dude (talk) 04:26, 24 November 2021 (UTC) November 24[edit] Proper way to archive my talk page[edit] I have just returned to Wikipedia after a long hiatus, and I would like to archive my talk page for the first time.

That article is a copy of fr:Claire Fierce, which I see you have worked on - it is a legal copy, since it attribues the source. Therefore your question is actually about translating the fr-wikipedia article. See Translation for information. Note that if you translate it, you are responsible for ensuring that the sources are adequate to establish notability, and that its tone meets the requirements of en-wiki. I see the fr-wiki article has been tagged for problems of tone and notability: a translation will not be accepted into en-wiki unless it meets our criteria, which I believe are at least as strict as those of fr-wiki. --ColinFine (talk) 11:33, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Also, the French language wiki article says that it reads like a CV, which would not be acceptable on English language wiki.

Joseph2302 (talk) 16:41, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Yes, thank you! --Fishermansworf (talk) 18:35, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Wisconsin Parade Murders[edit] If you want to call this slaughter a car or parade incident, you can. However, instead of making donations to Wikipedia (which I have done for years), I will laugh when asked and give you nothing. If this incident is watered down due to political correctness, then you are no longer a place for honest information, but rather you are just a joke. — Preceding unsigned comment added by 68.134.148.84 (talk) 21:12, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Wikipedia donations have no effect on the content whatsoever. The donations do not go to Wikipedia editors but instead to the WikiMedia Foundation who keep the servers up and running. None of the people who edit Wikipedia either receive any of the donations, know who has donated, or make any sort of decision based on the donations.

All that twitters is not bold. —A little blue Bori v^_^v Jéské Couriano 21:16, 24 November 2021 (UTC) IP user, if you are interested in a civil, collaborative discussion where a consensus is arrived at after a discussion, I invite you to participate. If you are just here to rant about alleged "political correctness", you should do that somewhere else. Donations are just that- donations- and you are free to donate or refrain from donating using whatever criteria you see fit, irrspective of how accurate it is. I would suggest that you read WP:TRUTH. 331dot (talk) 21:43, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Theatre[edit] For theatre Section should i use the year that the actors acted it or the date that the play was written? And what can i do if i don't know the year of the play? Thank you! — Preceding unsigned comment added by Mac O'Donnell (talk • contribs) 21:38, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Mac O'Donnell It might help if you told us which article you are discussing. 331dot (talk) 21:40, 24 November 2021 (UTC) You asked me for the name of the article it's Draft:Penny O'Brien the theatre section isn't finished but there's a play i don't know when did it happen but know when it was written. Feel free to check or edit :D Mac O'Donnell (talk) 21:43, 24 November 2021 (UTC) Mac O'Donnell I've moved your reply here, to keep the discussion in one location. 331dot (talk) 21:46, 24 November 2021 (UTC) If the play was written by Shakespeare, the date she acted in it would be relevant, the date he wrote it wouldn't be. If it was written by someone else, I think all that is still true.
