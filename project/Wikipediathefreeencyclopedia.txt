Shortly after the assassination, Whitman hastily wrote the first of his Lincoln poems, "Hush'd Be the Camps To-Day". Two more appeared in his collection Sequel to Drum-Taps later in 1865: "O Captain! My Captain!" and "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd". The poems—particularly "My Captain!"—were popular upon publication and, in the following years, Whitman styled himself as an interpreter of Lincoln. In 1871, his fourth poem on Lincoln, "This Dust Was Once the Man", was published. "My Captain!" is still one of Whitman's most popular works, despite slipping in popularity and critical assessment since the early 1900s. "Lilacs" is often listed as one of Whitman's finest works.

Shortly after the assassination, Whitman hastily wrote the first of his Lincoln poems, "Hush'd Be the Camps To-Day". Two more appeared in his collection Sequel to Drum-Taps later in 1865: "O Captain! My Captain!" and "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd". The poems—particularly "My Captain!"—were popular upon publication and, in the following years, Whitman styled himself as an interpreter of Lincoln. In 1871, his fourth poem on Lincoln, "This Dust Was Once the Man", was published. "My Captain!" is still one of Whitman's most popular works, despite slipping in popularity and critical assessment since the early 1900s. "Lilacs" is often listed as one of Whitman's finest works.

Sinclair House stands at the corner of East 79th Street and Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, New York City. It was built between 1897 and 1899, designed in a French Renaissance style by C. P. H. Gilbert and built by foreman Harvey Murdock. It was successively owned by businessmen Isaac D. Fletcher and Harry F. Sinclair, and then descendants of Peter Stuyvesant. The Ukrainian Institute of America acquired the mansion in 1955. It fell into disrepair and was renovated in the 1990s. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places and named a National Historic Landmark in 1978. The building largely retains its original design, being constructed mainly of brick faced with limestone ashlar. The northern façade on 79th Street includes the main entrance and has multiple windows in square recesses or Gothic arches. The western façade is symmetrical and dominated by a curved pavilion. The interior has six floors, with a total floorspace of 20,000 square feet (1,900 m2). (Full article...)

The name derives from its short length of only 15 minutes. The work is dedicated to Copland's friend, the Mexican composer and conductor Carlos Chávez (pictured). The composition contains complex rhythms and polyharmonies, and incorporates the composer's emerging interest in serialism and Mexican music. Copland later arranged the work as a sextet. The symphony was not widely performed during Copland's lifetime, largely due to the piece's rhythmic difficulties. After Serge Koussevitzky and Leopold Stokowski both declined to conduct the premiere, Chávez agreed to deliver it in 1934 in Mexico City. Though Copland thought of the Short Symphony as "one of the best things I ever wrote", some critics found it to be fragmented and cacophonous. Others agreed with Copland's assessment, describing the symphony as a masterpiece and a significant work in both Copland's career and modernist music. (Full article...)

The name derives from its short length of only 15 minutes. The work is dedicated to Copland's friend, the Mexican composer and conductor Carlos Chávez (pictured). The composition contains complex rhythms and polyharmonies, and incorporates the composer's emerging interest in serialism and Mexican music. Copland later arranged the work as a sextet. The symphony was not widely performed during Copland's lifetime, largely due to the piece's rhythmic difficulties. After Serge Koussevitzky and Leopold Stokowski both declined to conduct the premiere, Chávez agreed to deliver it in 1934 in Mexico City. Though Copland thought of the Short Symphony as "one of the best things I ever wrote", some critics found it to be fragmented and cacophonous. Others agreed with Copland's assessment, describing the symphony as a masterpiece and a significant work in both Copland's career and modernist music. (Full article...)

The name derives from its short length of only 15 minutes. The work is dedicated to Copland's friend, the Mexican composer and conductor Carlos Chávez (pictured). The composition contains complex rhythms and polyharmonies, and incorporates the composer's emerging interest in serialism and Mexican music. Copland later arranged the work as a sextet. The symphony was not widely performed during Copland's lifetime, largely due to the piece's rhythmic difficulties. After Serge Koussevitzky and Leopold Stokowski both declined to conduct the premiere, Chávez agreed to deliver it in 1934 in Mexico City. Though Copland thought of the Short Symphony as "one of the best things I ever wrote", some critics found it to be fragmented and cacophonous. Others agreed with Copland's assessment, describing the symphony as a masterpiece and a significant work in both Copland's career and modernist music. (Full article...)

Its name means "jaguar" in Quechua. The highest mountain in southwestern Bolivia, it rises to 6,008 metres (19,711 ft) within the Altiplano–Puna volcanic complex, a province of large volcanoes and calderas which over the last few million years have emplaced about 10,000 km3 (2,000 cu mi) of ignimbrites in large eruptions. Uturuncu's last eruption was about 250,000 years ago. Although it has no glaciers at present, it shows traces of a former glaciation. Underneath it lies the Altiplano–Puna Magma Body, a large sill formed by partially molten rocks. Since 1992, satellite observations have indicated a large area of regional uplift centered on Uturuncu, which may indicate magma intrusion under the volcano. This might be a prelude to large-scale volcanic activity, including supervolcanic activity and caldera formation. (Full article...)

Its name means "jaguar" in Quechua. The highest mountain in southwestern Bolivia, it rises to 6,008 metres (19,711 ft) within the Altiplano–Puna volcanic complex, a province of large volcanoes and calderas which over the last few million years have emplaced about 10,000 km3 (2,000 cu mi) of ignimbrites in large eruptions. Uturuncu's last eruption was about 250,000 years ago. Although it has no glaciers at present, it shows traces of a former glaciation. Underneath it lies the Altiplano–Puna Magma Body, a large sill formed by partially molten rocks. Since 1992, satellite observations have indicated a large area of regional uplift centered on Uturuncu, which may indicate magma intrusion under the volcano. This might be a prelude to large-scale volcanic activity, including supervolcanic activity and caldera formation. (Full article...)

Its name means "jaguar" in Quechua. The highest mountain in southwestern Bolivia, it rises to 6,008 metres (19,711 ft) within the Altiplano–Puna volcanic complex, a province of large volcanoes and calderas which over the last few million years have emplaced about 10,000 km3 (2,000 cu mi) of ignimbrites in large eruptions. Uturuncu's last eruption was about 250,000 years ago. Although it has no glaciers at present, it shows traces of a former glaciation. Underneath it lies the Altiplano–Puna Magma Body, a large sill formed by partially molten rocks. Since 1992, satellite observations have indicated a large area of regional uplift centered on Uturuncu, which may indicate magma intrusion under the volcano. This might be a prelude to large-scale volcanic activity, including supervolcanic activity and caldera formation. (Full article...)

Its name means "jaguar" in Quechua. The highest mountain in southwestern Bolivia, it rises to 6,008 metres (19,711 ft) within the Altiplano–Puna volcanic complex, a province of large volcanoes and calderas which over the last few million years have emplaced about 10,000 km3 (2,000 cu mi) of ignimbrites in large eruptions. Uturuncu's last eruption was about 250,000 years ago. Although it has no glaciers at present, it shows traces of a former glaciation. Underneath it lies the Altiplano–Puna Magma Body, a large sill formed by partially molten rocks. Since 1992, satellite observations have indicated a large area of regional uplift centered on Uturuncu, which may indicate magma intrusion under the volcano. This might be a prelude to large-scale volcanic activity, including supervolcanic activity and caldera formation. (Full article...)

Its name means "jaguar" in Quechua. The highest mountain in southwestern Bolivia, it rises to 6,008 metres (19,711 ft) within the Altiplano–Puna volcanic complex, a province of large volcanoes and calderas which over the last few million years have emplaced about 10,000 km3 (2,000 cu mi) of ignimbrites in large eruptions. Uturuncu's last eruption was about 250,000 years ago. Although it has no glaciers at present, it shows traces of a former glaciation. Underneath it lies the Altiplano–Puna Magma Body, a large sill formed by partially molten rocks. Since 1992, satellite observations have indicated a large area of regional uplift centered on Uturuncu, which may indicate magma intrusion under the volcano. This might be a prelude to large-scale volcanic activity, including supervolcanic activity and caldera formation. (Full article...)

Its name means "jaguar" in Quechua. The highest mountain in southwestern Bolivia, it rises to 6,008 metres (19,711 ft) within the Altiplano–Puna volcanic complex, a province of large volcanoes and calderas which over the last few million years have emplaced about 10,000 km3 (2,000 cu mi) of ignimbrites in large eruptions. Uturuncu's last eruption was about 250,000 years ago. Although it has no glaciers at present, it shows traces of a former glaciation. Underneath it lies the Altiplano–Puna Magma Body, a large sill formed by partially molten rocks. Since 1992, satellite observations have indicated a large area of regional uplift centered on Uturuncu, which may indicate magma intrusion under the volcano. This might be a prelude to large-scale volcanic activity, including supervolcanic activity and caldera formation. (Full article...)

Its name means "jaguar" in Quechua. The highest mountain in southwestern Bolivia, it rises to 6,008 metres (19,711 ft) within the Altiplano–Puna volcanic complex, a province of large volcanoes and calderas which over the last few million years have emplaced about 10,000 km3 (2,000 cu mi) of ignimbrites in large eruptions. Uturuncu's last eruption was about 250,000 years ago. Although it has no glaciers at present, it shows traces of a former glaciation. Underneath it lies the Altiplano–Puna Magma Body, a large sill formed by partially molten rocks. Since 1992, satellite observations have indicated a large area of regional uplift centered on Uturuncu, which may indicate magma intrusion under the volcano. This might be a prelude to large-scale volcanic activity, including supervolcanic activity and caldera formation. (Full article...)

Its name means "jaguar" in Quechua. The highest mountain in southwestern Bolivia, it rises to 6,008 metres (19,711 ft) within the Altiplano–Puna volcanic complex, a province of large volcanoes and calderas which over the last few million years have emplaced about 10,000 km3 (2,000 cu mi) of ignimbrites in large eruptions. Uturuncu's last eruption was about 250,000 years ago. Although it has no glaciers at present, it shows traces of a former glaciation. Underneath it lies the Altiplano–Puna Magma Body, a large sill formed by partially molten rocks. Since 1992, satellite observations have indicated a large area of regional uplift centered on Uturuncu, which may indicate magma intrusion under the volcano. This might be a prelude to large-scale volcanic activity, including supervolcanic activity and caldera formation. (Full article...)

Its name means "jaguar" in Quechua. The highest mountain in southwestern Bolivia, it rises to 6,008 metres (19,711 ft) within the Altiplano–Puna volcanic complex, a province of large volcanoes and calderas which over the last few million years have emplaced about 10,000 km3 (2,000 cu mi) of ignimbrites in large eruptions. Uturuncu's last eruption was about 250,000 years ago. Although it has no glaciers at present, it shows traces of a former glaciation. Underneath it lies the Altiplano–Puna Magma Body, a large sill formed by partially molten rocks. Since 1992, satellite observations have indicated a large area of regional uplift centered on Uturuncu, which may indicate magma intrusion under the volcano. This might be a prelude to large-scale volcanic activity, including supervolcanic activity and caldera formation. (Full article...)

This might be a prelude to large-scale volcanic activity, including supervolcanic activity and caldera formation. (Full article...)

Its name means "jaguar" in Quechua. The highest mountain in southwestern Bolivia, it rises to 6,008 metres (19,711 ft) within the Altiplano–Puna volcanic complex, a province of large volcanoes and calderas which over the last few million years have emplaced about 10,000 km3 (2,000 cu mi) of ignimbrites in large eruptions. Uturuncu's last eruption was about 250,000 years ago. Although it has no glaciers at present, it shows traces of a former glaciation. Underneath it lies the Altiplano–Puna Magma Body, a large sill formed by partially molten rocks. Since 1992, satellite observations have indicated a large area of regional uplift centered on Uturuncu, which may indicate magma intrusion under the volcano. This might be a prelude to large-scale volcanic activity, including supervolcanic activity and caldera formation. (Full article...)

Its name means "jaguar" in Quechua. The highest mountain in southwestern Bolivia, it rises to 6,008 metres (19,711 ft) within the Altiplano–Puna volcanic complex, a province of large volcanoes and calderas which over the last few million years have emplaced about 10,000 km3 (2,000 cu mi) of ignimbrites in large eruptions. Uturuncu's last eruption was about 250,000 years ago. Although it has no glaciers at present, it shows traces of a former glaciation. Underneath it lies the Altiplano–Puna Magma Body, a large sill formed by partially molten rocks. Since 1992, satellite observations have indicated a large area of regional uplift centered on Uturuncu, which may indicate magma intrusion under the volcano. This might be a prelude to large-scale volcanic activity, including supervolcanic activity and caldera formation. (Full article...)
