Prime Minister before Stefan Yanev (caretaker) Independent General elections were held in Bulgaria on 14 November 2021 to elect both the President and the National Assembly.[1][2] They were the country's third parliamentary elections in 2021, with no party able to form a government after the elections in April and July.[3][4] A second round of the presidential elections will be held on 21 November 2021 as no candidate was able to receive a majority of the vote in the first round.[5][6] Incumbent president Radev gathered around 49% of the vote, being forced into a runoff, facing the university professor Gerdzhikov.[7] We Continue the Change won the most seats, although it was not a majority. Shortly after the election, they announced that coalitions talks were going to be held.[8] Nationwide turnout fell to 40%, Bulgaria's lowest participation rate in 30 years for both presidential and legislative elections.[9] Contents 1 Background 2 Electoral system 3 Parties and coalitions 3.1 Parliamentary parties 3.2 Parties admitted to the elections 4 Presidential candidates 4.1 Candidates admitted to the elections 5 Campaign 6 Opinion polls 6.1 Legislative election 6.2 Presidential election 7 Results 7.1 President 7.2 National Assembly 8 Aftermath 9 Notes 10 References Background[edit] Politics of Bulgaria Constitution 1879 1947 1971 1991 Presidency President (list) Rumen Radev Vice President Iliana Iotova Executive Legislative Government Prime Minister (list) Stefan Yanev National Assembly Speaker: Iva Miteva Law Judiciary Nationality law Human rights Courts Constitutional Court Supreme Administrative Court Supreme Court of Cassation Office of the General Prosecutor Major political parties ITN GERB Bulgarian Socialist Party Democratic Bulgaria DPS ISMV Recent elections Presidential: 2016 2021 Parliamentary: April 2021 July 2021 Administrative divisions Provinces (oblasti) Municipalities (obshtini) Foreign relations 2007 EU enlargement Kristalina Georgieva Politics of the European Union  Bulgaria portal Other countries v t e See also: July 2021 Bulgarian parliamentary election and 2016 Bulgarian presidential election The previous parliamentary election which was held in July 2021, resulted in a narrow victory for the newly established There Is Such a People (ITN) over the ruling GERB party;[10] however, ITN won only 65 out of 240 seats in the National Assembly of Bulgaria.[10] Following the elections, ITN opted to try and form a minority government and started talks with potential partners (DB, IBG-NI, and BSP) in order to secure their support. Nevertheless, these attempts proved unsuccessful, and ITN announced on 10 August that they were withdrawing their proposed cabinet, making a third election more likely.[11][12] Slavi Trifonov, the leader of ITN, said in a video statement that this meant new elections.[13][14] The mandate to form a cabinet went to GERB.[15][16] GERB, the party of the previous prime minister Boyko Borisov, said earlier that it would not try to form a government.[17] The BSP said that if the scenario repeats itself, it would suggest that the incumbent caretaker cabinet becomes permanent. IBG-NI also expressed confidence that it could come up with a solution if handed the mandate to form a government.[18] Trifonov subsequently announced that he would not support any other parties proposing a cabinet.[19] Parliament announced on 2 September that Bulgaria would hold the first round of the presidential election on 14 November, with a snap election likely to take place in the same month.[20][21] On 6 September 2021, BSP handed back the last mandate of forming a government, meaning the parliament would be dissolved and a third parliamentary election would officially take place in 2021.[22] President Rumen Radev declared on 11 September that there would be two-in-one elections on 14 November for the first time in Bulgarian history, where voters would be able to vote on the president and the parliament. This decision was taken "to save treasury costs and voters' time".[23] Electoral system[edit] The 240 members of the National Assembly are elected by open list proportional representation from 31 multi-member constituencies ranging in size from 4 to 16 seats. The electoral threshold is 4% for parties, with seats allocated according to the largest remainder method.[24][25] The President of Bulgaria is elected using the two-round system,[26] with voters also given a none of the above option.[27] Parties and coalitions[edit] Parliamentary parties[edit] Party Main ideology Leader(s) Current seats ITN Populism Slavi Trifonov 65 GERB–SDS Conservatism Boyko Borisov 63 BSPzB Democratic socialism Korneliya Ninova 36 DB Liberal conservatism Hristo Ivanov 34 DPS Turkish minority interests Mustafa Karadayi 29 IBG-NI Anti-corruption Maya Manolova 13 Parties admitted to the elections[edit] When only some of the leaders of a coalition are its official representatives, their names are in bold.

The pandemic remained a large issue, especially with the rise of the Delta variant in the country.[29] The anti-corruption parties (ITN, DB, and IBG-NI) are all looking to hold their ground, while the traditional parties (GERB, DPS, and BSP) want to capitalise over the frustrations the public has with the inability to form a government. The elections are widely being hoped to bring an end to the political stalemate that has lasted since the April 2021 elections when no govermment could be formed. This time, there is more pressure on the anti-establishment parties to start negotiating a coalition government after the elections.[30] After the president announced the new caretaker cabinet,[31] the two economy and finance ministers who were replaced in the reshuffle, Kiril Petkov and Asen Vasilev, declared that they would compete in the November election, as part of a new coalition named We Continue the Change.[32] This coalition hopes to be a new anti-corruption force that can unite all others to effectively form a government. The global energy crisis was a large issue in the campaign, with natural gas prices soaring to record highs.[33] Different parties are offering their solutions on how to fix this, with some supporting relying more on Russia for energy, while others look to nuclear power in the longer term. This has tied into the high levels of inflation in the country, hitting record levels at 4.8% in September,[34] which has caused public dissatisfaction. Another large issue has been on COVID-19 vaccinations. Due to a low vaccine take-up and high rises in the number of cases, the caretaker government implemented a green pass, or also known as the vaccine passport.[35] The green pass introduces the rule that citizens must have proof of their vaccination status in several locations such as hospitals, schools and restaurants. Because of this, it caused widespread protests,[36] that could end up harming the incumbent government, especially President Radev. On 6 October, the instructions of the Minister of Health and the Chief State Health Inspector for voting were approved, they do not differ from those for the elections on 11 July. Deputy Chairman of the Central Election Commission, Rositsa Mateva, said ”there is no requirement for a green certificate for voting in the parliamentary and presidential elections on 14 November.”[37] Bulgaria’s Central Election Commission accepted the registrations of 23 candidates in for the presidential elections, the number of candidates were announced after the 12 October deadline for applications. This is the largest number of candidates in a presidential election in Bulgaria since the country began direct democratic elections of its head of state; previously, the highest number was 21, which occurred in 1992 and 2016.[38] OSCE announced it would send an observation team to the general elections in a statement, "following an invitation from the authorities of Bulgaria and in accordance with its mandate, ODIHR has deployed an Election Assessment Mission (EAM) for these elections." It noted that ODIHR had previously observed 12 elections in the country, most recently the 11 July 2021 early parliamentary elections.[39] Opinion polls[edit] Legislative election[edit] Graphical representation of recalculated data The opinion poll results below were recalculated from the original data and exclude polls that chose "I will not vote" or "I am uncertain" options.

Prime Minister before Stefan Yanev (caretaker) Independent General elections were held in Bulgaria on 14 November 2021 to elect both the President and the National Assembly.[1][2] They were the country's third parliamentary elections in 2021, with no party able to form a government after the elections in April and July.[3][4] A second round of the presidential elections will be held on 21 November 2021 as no candidate was able to receive a majority of the vote in the first round.[5][6] Incumbent president Rumen Radev gathered around 49% of the vote, being forced into a runoff, facing university professor Anastas Gerdzhikov.[7] We Continue the Change won the most seats, although it was not a majority. Shortly after the election, they announced that coalitions talks were going to be held.[8] Nationwide turnout fell to 40%, Bulgaria's lowest participation rate in 30 years for both presidential and legislative elections.[9] Contents 1 Background 2 Electoral system 3 Parties and coalitions 3.1 Parliamentary parties 3.2 Parties admitted to the elections 4 Presidential candidates 4.1 Candidates admitted to the elections 5 Campaign 6 Opinion polls 6.1 Legislative election 6.2 Presidential election 7 Results 7.1 President 7.2 National Assembly 8 Aftermath 9 See also 10 Notes 11 References Background[edit] Politics of Bulgaria Constitution 1879 1947 1971 1991 Presidency President (list) Rumen Radev Vice President Iliana Iotova Executive Legislative Government Prime Minister (list) Stefan Yanev National Assembly Speaker: Iva Miteva Law Judiciary Nationality law Human rights Courts Constitutional Court Supreme Administrative Court Supreme Court of Cassation Office of the General Prosecutor Major political parties ITN GERB Bulgarian Socialist Party Democratic Bulgaria DPS ISMV Recent elections Presidential: 2016 2021 Parliamentary: April 2021 July 2021 Administrative divisions Provinces (oblasti) Municipalities (obshtini) Foreign relations 2007 EU enlargement Kristalina Georgieva Politics of the European Union  Bulgaria portal Other countries v t e See also: July 2021 Bulgarian parliamentary election and 2016 Bulgarian presidential election The previous parliamentary election which was held in July 2021, resulted in a narrow victory for the newly established There Is Such a People (ITN) over the ruling GERB party;[10] however, ITN won only 65 out of 240 seats in the National Assembly of Bulgaria.[10] Following the elections, ITN opted to try and form a minority government and started talks with potential partners (DB, IBG-NI, and BSP) in order to secure their support. Nevertheless, these attempts proved unsuccessful, and ITN announced on 10 August that they were withdrawing their proposed cabinet, making a third election more likely.[11][12] Slavi Trifonov, the leader of ITN, said in a video statement that this meant new elections.[13][14] The mandate to form a cabinet went to GERB.[15][16] GERB, the party of the previous prime minister Boyko Borisov, said earlier that it would not try to form a government.[17] The BSP said that if the scenario repeats itself, it would suggest that the incumbent caretaker cabinet becomes permanent. IBG-NI also expressed confidence that it could come up with a solution if handed the mandate to form a government.[18] Trifonov subsequently announced that he would not support any other parties proposing a cabinet.[19] Parliament announced on 2 September that Bulgaria would hold the first round of the presidential election on 14 November, with a snap election likely to take place in the same month.[20][21] On 6 September 2021, BSP handed back the last mandate of forming a government, meaning the parliament would be dissolved and a third parliamentary election would officially take place in 2021.[22] President Rumen Radev declared on 11 September that there would be two-in-one elections on 14 November for the first time in Bulgarian history, where voters would be able to vote on the president and the parliament. This decision was taken "to save treasury costs and voters' time".[23] Electoral system[edit] The 240 members of the National Assembly are elected by open list proportional representation from 31 multi-member constituencies ranging in size from 4 to 16 seats. The electoral threshold is 4% for parties, with seats allocated according to the largest remainder method.[24][25] The President of Bulgaria is elected using the two-round system,[26] with voters also given a none of the above option.[27] Parties and coalitions[edit] Parliamentary parties[edit] Party Main ideology Leader(s) Current seats ITN Populism Slavi Trifonov 65 GERB–SDS Conservatism Boyko Borisov 63 BSPzB Democratic socialism Korneliya Ninova 36 DB Liberal conservatism Hristo Ivanov 34 DPS Turkish minority interests Mustafa Karadayi 29 IBG-NI Anti-corruption Maya Manolova 13 Parties admitted to the elections[edit] When only some of the leaders of a coalition are its official representatives, their names are in bold.

The pandemic remained a large issue, especially with the rise of the Delta variant in the country.[29] The anti-corruption parties (ITN, DB, and IBG-NI) are all looking to hold their ground, while the traditional parties (GERB, DPS, and BSP) want to capitalise over the frustrations the public has with the inability to form a government. The elections are widely being hoped to bring an end to the political stalemate that has lasted since the April 2021 elections when no govermment could be formed. This time, there is more pressure on the anti-establishment parties to start negotiating a coalition government after the elections.[30] After the president announced the new caretaker cabinet,[31] the two economy and finance ministers who were replaced in the reshuffle, Kiril Petkov and Asen Vasilev, declared that they would compete in the November election, as part of a new coalition named We Continue the Change.[32] This coalition hopes to be a new anti-corruption force that can unite all others to effectively form a government. The global energy crisis was a large issue in the campaign, with natural gas prices soaring to record highs.[33] Different parties are offering their solutions on how to fix this, with some supporting relying more on Russia for energy, while others look to nuclear power in the longer term. This has tied into the high levels of inflation in the country, hitting record levels at 4.8% in September,[34] which has caused public dissatisfaction. Another large issue has been on COVID-19 vaccinations. Due to a low vaccine take-up and high rises in the number of cases, the caretaker government implemented a green pass, or also known as the vaccine passport.[35] The green pass introduces the rule that citizens must have proof of their vaccination status in several locations such as hospitals, schools and restaurants. Because of this, it caused widespread protests,[36] that could end up harming the incumbent government, especially President Radev. On 6 October, the instructions of the Minister of Health and the Chief State Health Inspector for voting were approved, they do not differ from those for the elections on 11 July. Deputy Chairman of the Central Election Commission, Rositsa Mateva, said ”there is no requirement for a green certificate for voting in the parliamentary and presidential elections on 14 November.”[37] Bulgaria’s Central Election Commission accepted the registrations of 23 candidates in for the presidential elections, the number of candidates were announced after the 12 October deadline for applications. This is the largest number of candidates in a presidential election in Bulgaria since the country began direct democratic elections of its head of state; previously, the highest number was 21, which occurred in 1992 and 2016.[38] OSCE announced it would send an observation team to the general elections in a statement, "following an invitation from the authorities of Bulgaria and in accordance with its mandate, ODIHR has deployed an Election Assessment Mission (EAM) for these elections." It noted that ODIHR had previously observed 12 elections in the country, most recently the 11 July 2021 early parliamentary elections.[39] Opinion polls[edit] Legislative election[edit] Graphical representation of recalculated data The opinion poll results below were recalculated from the original data and exclude polls that chose "I will not vote" or "I am uncertain" options.

Prime Minister before Stefan Yanev (caretaker) Independent General elections were held in Bulgaria on 14 November 2021 to elect both the President and the National Assembly.[1][2] They were the country's third parliamentary elections in 2021, with no party able to form a government after the elections in April and July.[3][4] A second round of the presidential elections will be held on 21 November 2021 as no candidate was able to receive a majority of the vote in the first round.[5][6] Incumbent president Rumen Radev gathered around 49% of the vote, being forced into a runoff, facing university professor Anastas Gerdzhikov.[7] We Continue the Change won the most seats, although it was not a majority. Shortly after the election, they announced that coalitions talks were going to be held.[8] Nationwide turnout fell to 40%, Bulgaria's lowest participation rate in 30 years for both presidential and legislative elections.[9] Contents 1 Background 2 Electoral system 3 Parties and coalitions 3.1 Parliamentary parties 3.2 Parties admitted to the elections 4 Presidential candidates 4.1 Candidates admitted to the elections 5 Campaign 6 Opinion polls 6.1 Legislative election 6.2 Presidential election 7 Results 7.1 President 7.2 National Assembly 8 Aftermath 9 See also 10 Notes 11 References Background[edit] Politics of Bulgaria Constitution 1879 1947 1971 1991 Presidency President (list) Rumen Radev Vice President Iliana Iotova Executive Legislative Government Prime Minister (list) Stefan Yanev National Assembly Speaker: Iva Miteva Law Judiciary Nationality law Human rights Courts Constitutional Court Supreme Administrative Court Supreme Court of Cassation Office of the General Prosecutor Major political parties ITN GERB Bulgarian Socialist Party Democratic Bulgaria DPS ISMV Recent elections Presidential: 2016 2021 Parliamentary: April 2021 July 2021 Administrative divisions Provinces (oblasti) Municipalities (obshtini) Foreign relations 2007 EU enlargement Kristalina Georgieva Politics of the European Union  Bulgaria portal Other countries v t e See also: July 2021 Bulgarian parliamentary election and 2016 Bulgarian presidential election The previous parliamentary election which was held in July 2021, resulted in a narrow victory for the newly established There Is Such a People (ITN) over the ruling GERB party;[10] however, ITN won only 65 out of 240 seats in the National Assembly of Bulgaria.[10] Following the elections, ITN opted to try and form a minority government and started talks with potential partners (DB, IBG-NI, and BSP) in order to secure their support. Nevertheless, these attempts proved unsuccessful, and ITN announced on 10 August that they were withdrawing their proposed cabinet, making a third election more likely.[11][12] Slavi Trifonov, the leader of ITN, said in a video statement that this meant new elections.[13][14] The mandate to form a cabinet went to GERB.[15][16] GERB, the party of the previous prime minister Boyko Borisov, said earlier that it would not try to form a government.[17] The BSP said that if the scenario repeats itself, it would suggest that the incumbent caretaker cabinet becomes permanent. IBG-NI also expressed confidence that it could come up with a solution if handed the mandate to form a government.[18] Trifonov subsequently announced that he would not support any other parties proposing a cabinet.[19] Parliament announced on 2 September that Bulgaria would hold the first round of the presidential election on 14 November, with a snap election likely to take place in the same month.[20][21] On 6 September 2021, BSP handed back the last mandate of forming a government, meaning the parliament would be dissolved and a third parliamentary election would officially take place in 2021.[22] President Rumen Radev declared on 11 September that there would be two-in-one elections on 14 November for the first time in Bulgarian history, where voters would be able to vote on the president and the parliament. This decision was taken "to save treasury costs and voters' time".[23] Electoral system[edit] The 240 members of the National Assembly are elected by open list proportional representation from 31 multi-member constituencies ranging in size from 4 to 16 seats. The electoral threshold is 4% for parties, with seats allocated according to the largest remainder method.[24][25] The President of Bulgaria is elected using the two-round system,[26] with voters also given a none of the above option.[27] Parties and coalitions[edit] Parliamentary parties[edit] Party Main ideology Leader(s) Current seats ITN Populism Slavi Trifonov 65 GERB–SDS Conservatism Boyko Borisov 63 BSPzB Democratic socialism Korneliya Ninova 36 DB Liberal conservatism Hristo Ivanov 34 DPS Turkish minority interests Mustafa Karadayi 29 IBG-NI Anti-corruption Maya Manolova 13 Parties admitted to the elections[edit] When only some of the leaders of a coalition are its official representatives, their names are in bold.

The pandemic remained a large issue, especially with the rise of the Delta variant in the country.[29] The anti-corruption parties (ITN, DB, and IBG-NI) are all looking to hold their ground, while the traditional parties (GERB, DPS, and BSP) want to capitalise over the frustrations the public has with the inability to form a government. The elections are widely being hoped to bring an end to the political stalemate that has lasted since the April 2021 elections when no govermment could be formed. This time, there is more pressure on the anti-establishment parties to start negotiating a coalition government after the elections.[30] After the president announced the new caretaker cabinet,[31] the two economy and finance ministers who were replaced in the reshuffle, Kiril Petkov and Asen Vasilev, declared that they would compete in the November election, as part of a new coalition named We Continue the Change.[32] This coalition hopes to be a new anti-corruption force that can unite all others to effectively form a government. The global energy crisis was a large issue in the campaign, with natural gas prices soaring to record highs.[33] Different parties are offering their solutions on how to fix this, with some supporting relying more on Russia for energy, while others look to nuclear power in the longer term. This has tied into the high levels of inflation in the country, hitting record levels at 4.8% in September,[34] which has caused public dissatisfaction. Another large issue has been on COVID-19 vaccinations. Due to a low vaccine take-up and high rises in the number of cases, the caretaker government implemented a green pass, or also known as the vaccine passport.[35] The green pass introduces the rule that citizens must have proof of their vaccination status in several locations such as hospitals, schools and restaurants. Because of this, it caused widespread protests,[36] that could end up harming the incumbent government, especially President Radev. On 6 October, the instructions of the Minister of Health and the Chief State Health Inspector for voting were approved, they do not differ from those for the elections on 11 July. Deputy Chairman of the Central Election Commission, Rositsa Mateva, said ”there is no requirement for a green certificate for voting in the parliamentary and presidential elections on 14 November.”[37] Bulgaria’s Central Election Commission accepted the registrations of 23 candidates in for the presidential elections, the number of candidates were announced after the 12 October deadline for applications. This is the largest number of candidates in a presidential election in Bulgaria since the country began direct democratic elections of its head of state; previously, the highest number was 21, which occurred in 1992 and 2016.[38] OSCE announced it would send an observation team to the general elections in a statement, "following an invitation from the authorities of Bulgaria and in accordance with its mandate, ODIHR has deployed an Election Assessment Mission (EAM) for these elections." It noted that ODIHR had previously observed 12 elections in the country, most recently the 11 July 2021 early parliamentary elections.[39] Opinion polls[edit] Legislative election[edit] Graphical representation of recalculated data The opinion poll results below were recalculated from the original data and exclude polls that chose "I will not vote" or "I am uncertain" options.

Distribution of seats by electoral district. Prime Minister before Stefan Yanev (caretaker) Independent General elections were held in Bulgaria on 14 November 2021 to elect both the President and the National Assembly.[1][2] They were the country's third parliamentary elections in 2021, with no party able to form a government after the elections in April and July.[3][4] A second round of the presidential elections were held on 21 November 2021 as no candidate was able to receive a majority of the vote in the first round.[5][6] We Continue the Change won the most seats, although it was not a majority. Shortly after the election, they announced that coalition talks were going to be held.[7] Incumbent president Rumen Radev gathered around 49% of the vote, being forced into a runoff, facing university professor Anastas Gerdzhikov.[8] Nationwide turnout fell to 40%, Bulgaria's lowest participation rate in 30 years for both presidential and legislative elections.[9] Contents 1 Background 2 Electoral system 3 Parties and coalitions 3.1 Parliamentary parties 3.2 Parties admitted to the elections 4 Presidential candidates 4.1 Candidates admitted to the elections 5 Campaign 6 Opinion polls 6.1 Legislative election 6.2 Presidential election 7 Results 7.1 President 7.2 National Assembly 8 Aftermath 9 See also 10 Notes 11 References Background[edit] Politics of Bulgaria Constitution 1879 1947 1971 1991 Presidency President (list) Rumen Radev Vice President Iliana Iotova Executive Legislative Government Prime Minister (list) Stefan Yanev National Assembly Speaker: Iva Miteva Law Judiciary Nationality law Human rights Courts Constitutional Court Supreme Administrative Court Supreme Court of Cassation Office of the General Prosecutor Major political parties ITN GERB Bulgarian Socialist Party Democratic Bulgaria DPS ISMV Recent elections Presidential: 2016 2021 Parliamentary: April 2021 July 2021 Administrative divisions Provinces (oblasti) Municipalities (obshtini) Foreign relations 2007 EU enlargement Kristalina Georgieva Politics of the European Union  Bulgaria portal Other countries v t e See also: July 2021 Bulgarian parliamentary election and 2016 Bulgarian presidential election The previous parliamentary election which was held in July 2021, resulted in a narrow victory for the newly established There Is Such a People (ITN) over the ruling GERB party;[10] however, ITN won only 65 out of 240 seats in the National Assembly of Bulgaria.[10] Following the elections, ITN opted to try and form a minority government and started talks with potential partners (DB, IBG-NI, and BSP) in order to secure their support. Nevertheless, these attempts proved unsuccessful, and ITN announced on 10 August that they were withdrawing their proposed cabinet, making a third election more likely.[11][12] Slavi Trifonov, the leader of ITN, said in a video statement that this meant new elections.[13][14] The mandate to form a cabinet went to GERB.[15][16] GERB, the party of the previous prime minister Boyko Borisov, said earlier that it would not try to form a government.[17] The BSP said that if the scenario repeats itself, it would suggest that the incumbent caretaker cabinet becomes permanent. IBG-NI also expressed confidence that it could come up with a solution if handed the mandate to form a government.[18] Trifonov subsequently announced that he would not support any other parties proposing a cabinet.[19] Parliament announced on 2 September that Bulgaria would hold the first round of the presidential election on 14 November, with a snap election likely to take place in the same month.[20][21] On 6 September 2021, BSP handed back the last mandate of forming a government, meaning the parliament would be dissolved and a third parliamentary election would officially take place in 2021.[22] President Rumen Radev declared on 11 September that there would be two-in-one elections on 14 November for the first time in Bulgarian history, where voters would be able to vote on the president and the parliament. This decision was taken "to save treasury costs and voters' time".[23] Electoral system[edit] The 240 members of the National Assembly are elected by open list proportional representation from 31 multi-member constituencies ranging in size from 4 to 16 seats. The electoral threshold is 4% for parties, with seats allocated according to the largest remainder method.[24][25] The President of Bulgaria is elected using the two-round system,[26] with voters also given a none of the above option.[27] Parties and coalitions[edit] Parliamentary parties[edit] Party Main ideology Leader(s) Current seats ITN Populism Slavi Trifonov 65 GERB–SDS Conservatism Boyko Borisov 63 BSPzB Democratic socialism Korneliya Ninova 36 DB Liberal conservatism Hristo Ivanov 34 DPS Turkish minority interests Mustafa Karadayi 29 IBG-NI Anti-corruption Maya Manolova 13 Parties admitted to the elections[edit] When only some of the leaders of a coalition are its official representatives, their names are in bold.

The pandemic remained a large issue, especially with the rise of the Delta variant in the country.[29] The anti-corruption parties (ITN, DB, and IBG-NI) are all looking to hold their ground, while the traditional parties (GERB, DPS, and BSP) want to capitalise over the frustrations the public has with the inability to form a government. The elections are widely being hoped to bring an end to the political stalemate that has lasted since the April 2021 elections when no govermment could be formed. This time, there is more pressure on the anti-establishment parties to start negotiating a coalition government after the elections.[30] After the president announced the new caretaker cabinet,[31] the two economy and finance ministers who were replaced in the reshuffle, Kiril Petkov and Asen Vasilev, declared that they would compete in the November election, as part of a new coalition named We Continue the Change.[32] This coalition hopes to be a new anti-corruption force that can unite all others to effectively form a government. The global energy crisis was a large issue in the campaign, with natural gas prices soaring to record highs.[33] Different parties are offering their solutions on how to fix this, with some supporting relying more on Russia for energy, while others look to nuclear power in the longer term. This has tied into the high levels of inflation in the country, hitting record levels at 4.8% in September,[34] which has caused public dissatisfaction. Another large issue has been on COVID-19 vaccinations. Due to a low vaccine take-up and high rises in the number of cases, the caretaker government implemented a green pass, or also known as the vaccine passport.[35] The green pass introduces the rule that citizens must have proof of their vaccination status in several locations such as hospitals, schools and restaurants. Because of this, it caused widespread protests,[36] that could end up harming the incumbent government, especially President Radev. On 6 October, the instructions of the Minister of Health and the Chief State Health Inspector for voting were approved, they do not differ from those for the elections on 11 July. Deputy Chairman of the Central Election Commission, Rositsa Mateva, said ”there is no requirement for a green certificate for voting in the parliamentary and presidential elections on 14 November.”[37] Bulgaria’s Central Election Commission accepted the registrations of 23 candidates in for the presidential elections, the number of candidates were announced after the 12 October deadline for applications. This is the largest number of candidates in a presidential election in Bulgaria since the country began direct democratic elections of its head of state; previously, the highest number was 21, which occurred in 1992 and 2016.[38] OSCE announced it would send an observation team to the general elections in a statement, "following an invitation from the authorities of Bulgaria and in accordance with its mandate, ODIHR has deployed an Election Assessment Mission (EAM) for these elections." It noted that ODIHR had previously observed 12 elections in the country, most recently the 11 July 2021 early parliamentary elections.[39] Opinion polls[edit] Legislative election[edit] Graphical representation of recalculated data The opinion poll results below were recalculated from the original data and exclude polls that chose "I will not vote" or "I am uncertain" options.
