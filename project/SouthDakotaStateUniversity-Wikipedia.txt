Founded in 1881, it is the state's largest and most comprehensive university and the oldest continually-operating university in South Dakota.[4] The university is governed by the South Dakota Board of Regents, which governs the state's six public universities and two special schools. South Dakota State University is a land-grant university founded under the provisions of the 1862 Morrill Act. This land-grant heritage and mission has led the university to place a special focus on academic programs in agriculture, engineering, nursing, and pharmacy, as well as liberal arts. It is classified among "R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity". The graduate program is classified as Doctoral, Science, Technology, Engineering, Math dominant.[5] Contents 1 History 1.1 Presidents 2 Campus 2.1 Main campus 2.2 West campus 2.3 East campus 3 Academics 3.1 Rankings 3.2 Political Science Department 3.3 Department of Military Science 3.4 Research achievements 3.5 Online programs 4 Housing and Residential Life 4.1 Greek societies 5 Student life 6 Athletics 6.1 Men's basketball 6.2 Women's basketball 6.3 Men's football 6.3.1 Dana Dykhouse buildings and facilities 7 Notable alumni 7.1 Academia, science, and technology 7.2 Arts and literature 7.3 Business 7.4 Government 7.5 Military 7.6 Sports 8 References 9 External links History[edit] The Coughlin Campanile completed in 1929 on west campus. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. The university was founded in the Dakota Territory on February 21, 1881, as Dakota Agriculture College. The first building, with funding from the territorial legislature, was built in 1883, six years before the State of South Dakota was formed. Numerous expansions were funded in the late 19th century and early 20th century. The name was changed in 1904 to South Dakota State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts. In 1964, the name was changed to South Dakota State University. The name change was largely promoted by the Alumni Association. Initiated in 1962, this name change reflected the more comprehensive education offered at the university.[6] In 1923, SDSU's instructional program was organized under five divisions: Agriculture, Engineering, General Science, Home Economics, and Pharmacy. In 1956, a Nursing program was established, and in 1957 a formal graduate school was formed. When the University changed its name in 1964, the colleges were renamed Agriculture and Biological Sciences, Arts and Sciences, Engineering, Home Economics, Nursing, Pharmacy, and the Graduate School. In 1974, the College of General Registration (now the College of General Studies) was formed. In 1975, the Division of Education was created. An Honors College was formed in 1999. Two colleges and seven departments combined in 2009 to create the College of Education and Human Sciences. In 2017, the colleges which make up the university were revised and in some cases renamed to the following: College of Agriculture, Food and Environmental Sciences; College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences; College of Education and Human Sciences; College of Nursing; College of Pharmacy & Allied Health Professions; Graduate School; Jerome J. Lohr College of Engineering; University College; and Van D. and Barbara B. Fishback Honors College. Presidents[edit] On May 23, 2016 (formal inauguration held September 29, 2016), Barry H. Dunn became the 20th President of South Dakota State University. Dunn and his wife are alumni of SDSU, and prior to becoming president, Dunn was the Dean of SDSU's College of Agriculture and Biological Sciences.

The 73,000-square-foot (6,800 m2) SDSU Wellness Center opened in the fall of 2008. The building lightens up space in the HPER Center, allowing that to be used exclusively by athletes, while the Wellness Center is used only by students and the public. Student memberships are free and Brookings community members may purchase memberships. Numerous group exercise programs and classes are offered, along with personal training. The building houses a rock climbing wall, a track, three basketball courts, a competition size swimming pool, and numerous weights and cardiovascular equipment. It is also the home of Student Health, which includes a full pharmacy for students. West campus[edit] Avera Health Sciences Center on the west side of campus The Coughlin Campanile, formerly used as the campus bell tower, is a familiar sight around campus. The campus also has two museums, the South Dakota Art Museum (featuring works by Harvey Dunn and Oscar Howe, among others), and the South Dakota Agricultural Heritage Museum. The art museum is home to over 7,000 works of art, while the agricultural museum is home to over 100,000 objects. Both museums are open free to the public. The university operates its own dairy plant, processing 10,000 lb (4.5 t) of milk weekly into cheese and ice cream, operates a cattle and sheep breeding operation, has an on-campus meat processing facility, and has a student-operated pharmacy. East campus[edit] McCrory Gardens and South Dakota Arboretum on the east side of campus Also close to campus are the McCrory Gardens and South Dakota Arboretum. These gardens include a 20-acre (8.1 ha) public display and a 45-acre (18 ha) arboretum. The gardens are open daily to the public. SDSU is also home to State University Theatre and Prairie Repertory Theatre, which produce numerous plays and musicals during the school year and summer breaks.

SDSU's Department of Political Science has been successful at producing many of the state's current and past congressional delegations. Currently, two of South Dakota's three congressional members are alumni in U.S. Senator Mike Rounds and Governor of South Dakota Kristi Noem. Noem completed her political science degree while she was in Congress. Perhaps the most notable of the program is former U.S. Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle. Former U.S. Representative Stephanie Herseth has served as a professor of the program. The department produced two Truman Scholars in 2004 and 2006 respectively, including Tony Venhuizen.[18] Department of Military Science[edit] The Department of Military Science commissions officers into the military. The department's cadets complete the requirements for a bachelor's or graduate degree and are then commissioned as second lieutenants. The department has been successful in producing many U.S. Generals including William E. DePuy, Jake Krull, Raymond W. Carpenter, Franklin J. Blaisdell, Mark A. Clark, as well as Medal of Honor recipient Leo K. Thorsness and Willibald C. Bianchi. Military Alumni Medal of Honor recipient Leo Thorsness Medal of Honor recipient Willibald C. Bianchi U.S. General William E. DePuy The Department has produced two Medal of Honor recipients as well as a plethora of U.S. Generals. Research achievements[edit] South Dakota State University currently ranks among the Midwest's top research universities, notably in the fields of agricultural science, biological science, and engineering.[19] It is consistently listed in U.S. News and World Report's "Top 200 National Universities" in its college and university rankings.[19] The campus is also home to the Geospatial Sciences Center of Excellence, a research and educational collaboration with United States Geological Survey Center for Earth Resources Observation and Science.[20][21] The GSCE focuses on basic and applied research in terrestrial remote sensing.[22] SDSU was recognized in 2017 by ShanghaiRanking Consultancy as the 7th most productive university in the US (and 27th globally) for remote sensing research for the period 2011–2015.[23] The university operates the South Dakota state agricultural research stations around the state, such as the Antelope Range and Livestock Research Station near Buffalo. The Great Plains Writers Conference is a venue for significant regional authors or writers interested in the Great Plains. It was instituted at SDSU in 1976 for writing scholarship.[24] Notable research achievements by alumni include: Stephen Foster Briggs '07 invented the Briggs & Stratton engine while a student at SDSU in 1906. Gene Amdahl '48 was the chief architect of the IBM 360 computer in 1964. The first ethanol production facility in the United States was established at SDSU in 1979. Alumni from the university's research community notable for scientific achievements include: Stephen Foster Briggs, B.S. 1907, invented the Briggs & Stratton internal-combustion engine[25] Theodore Schultz, B.S. Economics & Agriculture 1928, received the 1979 Nobel Prize in Economics Paul Middaugh, B.S., established the nation's first on-campus research facility for ethanol fuel production in 1979[26] Gene Amdahl, B.S. Engineering & Physics, 1948, developed the IBM 360 computer and later the IBM 704, IBM 709 computers, and Amdahl's Law[27] Aelred Kurtenbach and Duane Sander, electrical engineering professors, founded Daktronics, Inc.[28] Carrie Buthe, B.S. Civil Engineering, served as a design engineer for the Lewis and Clark Regional Water System.[29] Online programs[edit] SDSU offers a variety of online programs. The university offers associate degrees, bachelor's degrees, master's degrees, and certificate programs that students can complete online.[30] Housing and Residential Life[edit] The northern Jackrabbit Village Students have a variety of residential hall and apartment living choices. Student housing is located in three areas: the Medary complex located in the northwest corner of campus, consisting of traditional residence halls, Hansen, and apartment-style living at Meadows North and Meadows South; the Grove complex near the Student Union, consisting of traditional residence halls, Brown, Mathews and Pierson, as well as a newer (2010) variation on the theme of traditional residence halls in Spencer, Thorne and Abbott (also called the Jackrabbit Village); and the Larson complex on the east side of campus, consisting of traditional halls Binnewies and Young and suite living at Caldwell Hall. The residential halls on the campus of SDSU make up the densest concentration of people in South Dakota. All of the residence halls with the exceptions of Caldwell and both Meadows buildings are co-ed by wing, with each wing having its own bathroom. Caldwell Hall is suite style, meaning two rooms share a common bathroom for the four occupants and each floor on Caldwell is co-ed. The Meadows North and Meadows South apartment complexes feature four-bedroom apartments. Modern-styled dormitories Some residence halls have a Living/Learning Community, where an entire floor is composed of a certain group of students. Examples include Agriculture and Biology Majors, Honors College, Engineering/ Learning Community, Health Professionals Living/Learning Community and Substance-Free housing. Furniture in the halls is moveable and the provided beds may be lofted; students do not need to purchase or bring their own loft. Residents may also contract phone and cable services with the appropriate companies. Washers and dryers are available in all the halls and operate with either cash or by using campus Hobo Dough. Ben Reifel Hall, Hyde, Theodore Schultz Hall and the Honors Hall (collectively, the Jackrabbit Grove) opened in the fall of 2013. Schultz Hall is home of the Wellness Living/Learning Community and the Honors Hall, as the name suggests, is home to the Honors College. They are similar in amenities to the Jackrabbit Village halls (Spencer, Thorne and Abbott). The most recent addition to the dormitories was the Southeast University Neighborhood, located on the corner of 8th Street and 16th Avenue. These buildings are intended for juniors, seniors and graduate students, and are thus more similar to regular apartments, with full kitchens, furniture, and summer storage, even a Starbucks attached.[31] Nearby are the Townhouses, which are similar to the Neighborhood apartments, but also allow pets and do not require meal plans.[32] Greek societies[edit] This list contains only social fraternities that are a part of either the Interfraternity Council or the College Panhellenic Association.[9] Other fraternities and sororities exist as general student organizations.

Student life[edit] The SDSU Marching Band, "The Pride of the Dakotas", given the special name the Millennium Band in 2000 by the South Dakota State Legislature, has marched in the 1981 and 1997 Presidential Inaugural Parades in Washington, D.C.; A Capital Fourth in 2000 in Washington, D.C., which was broadcast on PBS; the 2003 and 2008 Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, California, making them the second collegiate band in the history of the Rose Bowl to be invited to march twice when their team was not competing; and the Korean War Monument Dedication at the state's capital Pierre in 2004, in the company of two other college bands and 60-some high school bands from across the state. The homecoming celebration, Hobo Day, is "The Biggest One-Day Event in the Dakotas."[33] Athletics[edit] Main article: South Dakota State Jackrabbits SDSU participates in athletics as a member of NCAA Division I. SDSU's athletic conference affiliations include the Summit League for most sports, the Missouri Valley Football Conference (Division I FCS), the Big 12 Conference (wrestling) and Varsity Equestrian. The Jackrabbits have 19 varsity sports and numerous intramural and club teams. South Dakota State's athletic mascot for both the men's and women's teams is the Jackrabbit, both the men's and women's sports teams are officially referred to as the Jackrabbits. Men's basketball[edit] Frost Arena, the venerable home of South Dakota State basketball Main article: South Dakota State Jackrabbits men's basketball Division II national champions in 1963, the Jackrabbits have had one of the most successful mid-major programs in the nation since joining the ranks of Division I. SDSU has won at least a share of the Summit League regular season title in seven of the past nine seasons, including each of the last four. The Jackrabbits have won five conference tournaments, qualifying for the NCAA Division I Tournament in 2012, 2013, 2016, 2017 and 2018. During that run, two all-Americans have shined for the Jackrabbits – Nate Wolters and Mike Daum. Additionally, Wolters is one of seven State alums who have been selected in the NBA Draft. Since 2012, no Division I men’s basketball program has won a greater percentage of its home games than South Dakota State. Women's basketball[edit] Main article: South Dakota State Jackrabbits women's basketball Head coach Aaron Johnston took over the program at the beginning of the new century and women’s basketball at SDSU was never the same. The Jackrabbits reached the NCAA Elite Eight in each of their final three seasons in Division II, winning the national championship in 2003. After becoming the first school transitioning to Division I to earn a postseason bid, playing in the WNIT in both 2007 and 2008, SDSU turned its focus to dominating the Summit League. The Jacks have won nine of the 13 conference tournaments they have played in. The program has played in ten NCAA Division I Tournaments, winning four games, highlighted by a trip to the Sweet Sixteen in 2018. The program also won first round games in 2009 and 2015. Macy Miller led the program to three of those four victories en route to becoming the school’s all-time scoring leader. She was selected in the second round of the 2018 WNBA Draft. Men's football[edit] Main article: South Dakota State Jackrabbits football The Jackrabbits have appeared in the NCAA Division I FCS playoffs 10 times with an overall record of 11-9. They were in the Championship game May 20, 2021, losing 23-21 to Sam Houston State. The Jackrabbits were semifinalists in 2017 and 2018. SDSU is one of two schools with an active streak of nine consecutive postseason appearances at the FCS level. All of this was accomplished by John Stiegelmeier, the school’s winningest head coach, after the program managed only one Division II playoff appearance (1979). Zach Zenner became the first Division I football player to record three consecutive seasons of 2,000 rushing yards (2012–14). The program’s national standing persuaded ESPN’s College Gameday television show to come to the Brookings campus for a live broadcast of its show on October 26, 2019. Dana Dykhouse buildings and facilities[edit] Main article: Dana J. Dykhouse Stadium Dana J. Dykhouse Stadium A 19,340-capacity stadium opened in the fall of 2016. It is considered among the premier FCS Division I stadiums. The Dykhouse Student-Athlete Center, located on the north end of the Dana J. Dykhouse Stadium, is the home of Jackrabbit football, It opened prior to the 2010 football season and houses an academic center equipped with study areas, computers, tutors and other educational aids for all South Dakota State teams. The Sanford Jackrabbit Athlete Complex, a state-of-the-art indoor practice and competition facility opened October 11, 2014. It is immediately north of and attached to the Dykhouse Student-Athlete Center. The SJAC has bleacher seating for up to 1,000 spectators and can be used for track practice and track meets, football practice, softball and baseball practice, golf practice and other events within the SDSU athletic department. It includes 149,284-square foot facility and features an eight-lane, 300-meter track, one of only five collegiate indoor tracks of that size in the nation.

Founded in 1881, it is the state's largest and most comprehensive university and the oldest continually-operating university in South Dakota.[4] The university is governed by the South Dakota Board of Regents, which governs the state's six public universities and two special schools. South Dakota State University is a land-grant university founded under the provisions of the 1862 Morrill Act. This land-grant heritage and mission has led the university to place a special focus on academic programs in agriculture, engineering, nursing, and pharmacy, as well as liberal arts. It is classified among "R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity". The graduate program is classified as Doctoral, Science, Technology, Engineering, Math dominant.[5] Contents 1 History 1.1 Presidents 2 Campus 2.1 Main campus 2.2 West campus 2.3 East campus 3 Academics 3.1 Rankings 3.2 Political Science Department 3.3 Department of Military Science 3.4 Research achievements 3.5 Online programs 4 Housing and Residential Life 4.1 Greek societies 5 Student life 6 Athletics 6.1 Men's basketball 6.2 Women's basketball 6.3 Men's football 6.3.1 Dana Dykhouse buildings and facilities 7 Notable alumni 7.1 Academia, science, and technology 7.2 Arts and literature 7.3 Business 7.4 Government 7.5 Military 7.6 Sports 8 References 9 External links History[edit] The Coughlin Campanile completed in 1929 on west campus. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. The university was founded in the Dakota Territory on February 21, 1881, as Dakota Agriculture College. The first building, with funding from the territorial legislature, was built in 1883, six years before the State of South Dakota was formed. Numerous expansions were funded in the late 19th century and early 20th century. The name was changed in 1904 to South Dakota State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts. In 1964, the name was changed to South Dakota State University. The name change was largely promoted by the Alumni Association. Initiated in 1962, this name change reflected the more comprehensive education offered at the university.[6] In 1923, SDSU's instructional program was organized under five divisions: Agriculture, Engineering, General Science, Home Economics, and Pharmacy. In 1956, a Nursing program was established, and in 1957 a formal graduate school was formed. When the University changed its name in 1964, the colleges were renamed Agriculture and Biological Sciences, Arts and Sciences, Engineering, Home Economics, Nursing, Pharmacy, and the Graduate School. In 1974, the College of General Registration (now the College of General Studies) was formed. In 1975, the Division of Education was created. An Honors College was formed in 1999. Two colleges and seven departments combined in 2009 to create the College of Education and Human Sciences. In 2017, the colleges which make up the university were revised and in some cases renamed to the following: College of Agriculture, Food and Environmental Sciences; College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences; College of Education and Human Sciences; College of Nursing; College of Pharmacy & Allied Health Professions; Graduate School; Jerome J. Lohr College of Engineering; University College; and Van D. and Barbara B. Fishback Honors College. Presidents[edit] On May 23, 2016 (formal inauguration held September 29, 2016), Barry H. Dunn became the 20th President of South Dakota State University. Dunn and his wife are alumni of SDSU, and prior to becoming president, Dunn was the Dean of SDSU's College of Agriculture and Biological Sciences.

The 73,000-square-foot (6,800 m2) SDSU Wellness Center opened in the fall of 2008. The building lightens up space in the HPER Center, allowing that to be used exclusively by athletes, while the Wellness Center is used only by students and the public. Student memberships are free and Brookings community members may purchase memberships. Numerous group exercise programs and classes are offered, along with personal training. The building houses a rock climbing wall, a track, three basketball courts, a competition size swimming pool, and numerous weights and cardiovascular equipment. It is also the home of Student Health, which includes a full pharmacy for students. West campus[edit] Avera Health Sciences Center on the west side of campus The Coughlin Campanile, formerly used as the campus bell tower, is a familiar sight around campus. The campus also has two museums, the South Dakota Art Museum (featuring works by Harvey Dunn and Oscar Howe, among others), and the South Dakota Agricultural Heritage Museum. The art museum is home to over 7,000 works of art, while the agricultural museum is home to over 100,000 objects. Both museums are open free to the public. The university operates its own dairy plant, processing 10,000 lb (4.5 t) of milk weekly into cheese and ice cream, operates a cattle and sheep breeding operation, has an on-campus meat processing facility, and has a student-operated pharmacy. East campus[edit] McCrory Gardens and South Dakota Arboretum on the east side of campus Also close to campus are the McCrory Gardens and South Dakota Arboretum. These gardens include a 20-acre (8.1 ha) public display and a 45-acre (18 ha) arboretum. The gardens are open daily to the public. SDSU is also home to State University Theatre and Prairie Repertory Theatre, which produce numerous plays and musicals during the school year and summer breaks.

SDSU's Department of Political Science has been successful at producing many of the state's current and past congressional delegations. Currently, two of South Dakota's three congressional members are alumni in U.S. Senator Mike Rounds and Governor of South Dakota Kristi Noem. Noem completed her political science degree while she was in Congress. Perhaps the most notable of the program is former U.S. Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle. Former U.S. Representative Stephanie Herseth has served as a professor of the program. The department produced two Truman Scholars in 2004 and 2006 respectively, including Tony Venhuizen.[18] Department of Military Science[edit] The Department of Military Science commissions officers into the military. The department's cadets complete the requirements for a bachelor's or graduate degree and are then commissioned as second lieutenants. The department has been successful in producing many U.S. Generals including William E. DePuy, Jake Krull, Raymond W. Carpenter, Franklin J. Blaisdell, Mark A. Clark, as well as Medal of Honor recipient Leo K. Thorsness and Willibald C. Bianchi. Military Alumni Medal of Honor recipient Leo Thorsness Medal of Honor recipient Willibald C. Bianchi U.S. General William E. DePuy The Department has produced two Medal of Honor recipients as well as a plethora of U.S. Generals. Research achievements[edit] South Dakota State University currently ranks among the Midwest's top research universities, notably in the fields of agricultural science, biological science, and engineering.[19] It is consistently listed in U.S. News and World Report's "Top 200 National Universities" in its college and university rankings.[19] The campus is also home to the Geospatial Sciences Center of Excellence, a research and educational collaboration with United States Geological Survey Center for Earth Resources Observation and Science.[20][21] The GSCE focuses on basic and applied research in terrestrial remote sensing.[22] SDSU was recognized in 2017 by ShanghaiRanking Consultancy as the 7th most productive university in the US (and 27th globally) for remote sensing research for the period 2011–2015.[23] The university operates the South Dakota state agricultural research stations around the state, such as the Antelope Range and Livestock Research Station near Buffalo. The Great Plains Writers Conference is a venue for significant regional authors or writers interested in the Great Plains. It was instituted at SDSU in 1976 for writing scholarship.[24] Notable research achievements by alumni include: Stephen Foster Briggs '07 invented the Briggs & Stratton engine while a student at SDSU in 1906. Gene Amdahl '48 was the chief architect of the IBM 360 computer in 1964. The first ethanol production facility in the United States was established at SDSU in 1979. Alumni from the university's research community notable for scientific achievements include: Stephen Foster Briggs, B.S. 1907, invented the Briggs & Stratton internal-combustion engine[25] Theodore Schultz, B.S. Economics & Agriculture 1928, received the 1979 Nobel Prize in Economics Paul Middaugh, B.S., established the nation's first on-campus research facility for ethanol fuel production in 1979[26] Gene Amdahl, B.S. Engineering & Physics, 1948, developed the IBM 360 computer and later the IBM 704, IBM 709 computers, and Amdahl's Law[27] Aelred Kurtenbach and Duane Sander, electrical engineering professors, founded Daktronics, Inc.[28] Carrie Buthe, B.S. Civil Engineering, served as a design engineer for the Lewis and Clark Regional Water System.[29] Online programs[edit] SDSU offers a variety of online programs. The university offers associate degrees, bachelor's degrees, master's degrees, and certificate programs that students can complete online.[30] Housing and Residential Life[edit] The northern Jackrabbit Village Students have a variety of residential hall and apartment living choices. Student housing is located in three areas: the Medary complex located in the northwest corner of campus, consisting of traditional residence halls, Hansen, and apartment-style living at Meadows North and Meadows South; the Grove complex near the Student Union, consisting of traditional residence halls, Brown, Mathews and Pierson, as well as a newer (2010) variation on the theme of traditional residence halls in Spencer, Thorne and Abbott (also called the Jackrabbit Village); and the Larson complex on the east side of campus, consisting of traditional halls Binnewies and Young and suite living at Caldwell Hall. The residential halls on the campus of SDSU make up the densest concentration of people in South Dakota. All of the residence halls with the exceptions of Caldwell and both Meadows buildings are co-ed by wing, with each wing having its own bathroom. Caldwell Hall is suite style, meaning two rooms share a common bathroom for the four occupants and each floor on Caldwell is co-ed. The Meadows North and Meadows South apartment complexes feature four-bedroom apartments. Modern-styled dormitories Some residence halls have a Living/Learning Community, where an entire floor is composed of a certain group of students. Examples include Agriculture and Biology Majors, Honors College, Engineering/ Learning Community, Health Professionals Living/Learning Community and Substance-Free housing. Furniture in the halls is moveable and the provided beds may be lofted; students do not need to purchase or bring their own loft. Residents may also contract phone and cable services with the appropriate companies. Washers and dryers are available in all the halls and operate with either cash or by using campus Hobo Dough. Ben Reifel Hall, Hyde, Theodore Schultz Hall and the Honors Hall (collectively, the Jackrabbit Grove) opened in the fall of 2013. Schultz Hall is home of the Wellness Living/Learning Community and the Honors Hall, as the name suggests, is home to the Honors College. They are similar in amenities to the Jackrabbit Village halls (Spencer, Thorne and Abbott). The most recent addition to the dormitories was the Southeast University Neighborhood, located on the corner of 8th Street and 16th Avenue. These buildings are intended for juniors, seniors and graduate students, and are thus more similar to regular apartments, with full kitchens, furniture, and summer storage, even a Starbucks attached.[31] Nearby are the Townhouses, which are similar to the Neighborhood apartments, but also allow pets and do not require meal plans.[32] Greek societies[edit] This list contains only social fraternities that are a part of either the Interfraternity Council or the College Panhellenic Association.[9] Other fraternities and sororities exist as general student organizations.

Student life[edit] The SDSU Marching Band, "The Pride of the Dakotas", given the special name the Millennium Band in 2000 by the South Dakota State Legislature, has marched in the 1981 and 1997 Presidential Inaugural Parades in Washington, D.C.; A Capital Fourth in 2000 in Washington, D.C., which was broadcast on PBS; the 2003 and 2008 Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, California, making them the second collegiate band in the history of the Rose Bowl to be invited to march twice when their team was not competing; and the Korean War Monument Dedication at the state's capital Pierre in 2004, in the company of two other college bands and 60-some high school bands from across the state. The homecoming celebration, Hobo Day, is "The Biggest One-Day Event in the Dakotas."[33] Athletics[edit] Main article: South Dakota State Jackrabbits SDSU participates in athletics as a member of NCAA Division I. SDSU's athletic conference affiliations include the Summit League for most sports, the Missouri Valley Football Conference (Division I FCS), the Big 12 Conference (wrestling) and Varsity Equestrian. The Jackrabbits have 19 varsity sports and numerous intramural and club teams. South Dakota State's athletic mascot for both the men's and women's teams is the Jackrabbit, both the men's and women's sports teams are officially referred to as the Jackrabbits. Men's basketball[edit] Frost Arena, the venerable home of South Dakota State basketball Main article: South Dakota State Jackrabbits men's basketball Division II national champions in 1963, the Jackrabbits have had one of the most successful mid-major programs in the nation since joining the ranks of Division I. SDSU has won at least a share of the Summit League regular season title in seven of the past nine seasons, including each of the last four. The Jackrabbits have won five conference tournaments, qualifying for the NCAA Division I Tournament in 2012, 2013, 2016, 2017 and 2018. During that run, two all-Americans have shined for the Jackrabbits – Nate Wolters and Mike Daum. Additionally, Wolters is one of seven State alums who have been selected in the NBA Draft. Since 2012, no Division I men’s basketball program has won a greater percentage of its home games than South Dakota State. Women's basketball[edit] Main article: South Dakota State Jackrabbits women's basketball Head coach Aaron Johnston took over the program at the beginning of the new century and women’s basketball at SDSU was never the same. The Jackrabbits reached the NCAA Elite Eight in each of their final three seasons in Division II, winning the national championship in 2003. After becoming the first school transitioning to Division I to earn a postseason bid, playing in the WNIT in both 2007 and 2008, SDSU turned its focus to dominating the Summit League. The Jacks have won nine of the 13 conference tournaments they have played in. The program has played in ten NCAA Division I Tournaments, winning four games, highlighted by a trip to the Sweet Sixteen in 2018. The program also won first round games in 2009 and 2015. Macy Miller led the program to three of those four victories en route to becoming the school’s all-time scoring leader. She was selected in the second round of the 2018 WNBA Draft. Men's football[edit] Main article: South Dakota State Jackrabbits football The Jackrabbits have appeared in the NCAA Division I FCS playoffs 10 times with an overall record of 11-9. They were in the Championship game May 20, 2021, losing 23-21 to Sam Houston State. The Jackrabbits were semifinalists in 2017 and 2018. SDSU is one of two schools with an active streak of nine consecutive postseason appearances at the FCS level. All of this was accomplished by John Stiegelmeier, the school’s winningest head coach, after the program managed only one Division II playoff appearance (1979). Zach Zenner became the first Division I football player to record three consecutive seasons of 2,000 rushing yards (2012–14). The program’s national standing persuaded ESPN’s College Gameday television show to come to the Brookings campus for a live broadcast of its show on October 26, 2019. Dana Dykhouse buildings and facilities[edit] Main article: Dana J. Dykhouse Stadium Dana J. Dykhouse Stadium A 19,340-capacity stadium opened in the fall of 2016. It is considered among the premier FCS Division I stadiums. The Dykhouse Student-Athlete Center, located on the north end of the Dana J. Dykhouse Stadium, is the home of Jackrabbit football, It opened prior to the 2010 football season and houses an academic center equipped with study areas, computers, tutors and other educational aids for all South Dakota State teams. The Sanford Jackrabbit Athlete Complex, a state-of-the-art indoor practice and competition facility opened October 11, 2014. It is immediately north of and attached to the Dykhouse Student-Athlete Center. The SJAC has bleacher seating for up to 1,000 spectators and can be used for track practice and track meets, football practice, softball and baseball practice, golf practice and other events within the SDSU athletic department. It includes 149,284-square foot facility and features an eight-lane, 300-meter track, one of only five collegiate indoor tracks of that size in the nation.
