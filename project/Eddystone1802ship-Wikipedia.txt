The Hudson's Bay Company ships Prince of Wales and Eddystone bartering with the Inuit off the Upper Savage Islands, Hudson Strait; by Robert Hood (1819) History United Kingdom Name Eddystone Namesake Eddystone Rocks Builder Hull Launched 1802 Fate Wrecked 19 May 1843 General characteristics Tons burthen 245[1][2] (bm) Complement 28[2] Armament 2 × 6-pounder guns + 12 × 9-pounder carronades[2] Eddystone (or Eddistone) was launched at Hull in 1802. She then sailed for the North West Company. The French Navy captured her in 1806 but an armed ship of the Royal Navy recaptured her within weeks. She next sailed for the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) from 1807 to about 1824. She then traded generally until May 1843 when she was wrecked. Career[edit] Eddystone first appeared in Lloyd's Register (LR) in 1802 with Featherstone, master and owner, and trade Hull–Baltic.[1] The North West Company's flag after 1801 In 1803 John Fraser, one of the founders of the North West Company, purchased her. At the time, the North West company was challenging the HBC's monopoly on the fur trade at Hudson's Bay. The North West Company sent an overland expedition to the southern end of the bay, and sent Eddyston to meet it there. The Company then established a post on Charlton Island, on James Bay.[3] Year Master Owner Trade Source 1803 Featherstone Richards Feaherstone Fraser & Co. Hull–Baltic LR 1805 Richard Sarman Fraser & Co. Hull–Baltic London–Quebec LR The French frigates Sirène and Revanche captured Eddystone, Sarman, master, on 13 September 1806 as she was sailing from Quebec to London. The French took out her captain, crew, and furs, which were the most valuable part of her cargo. Colpoys recaptured Eddystone off Cape Finisterre and sent her into Plymouth, where she arrived in early October.[4][5] By 1807 the North West Company had given up its operations at Charlton Island. The problem was not the HBC's opposition but rather was one of lack of trade.[3] In 1807 the HBC purchased Eddystone and appointed Captain Thomas Ramsey as her master. Thereafter, Eddystone and Prince of Wales were the main vessels supplying the HBC's posts in Hudson Bay.[6][Note 1] Captain Thomas Ramsey acquired a letter of marque on 2 May 1808.[2] Year Master Owner Trade Sources & notes 1807 Sarman Ramsey Fraser & Co.

In 1815, Eddystone became trapped in the lower part of Hudson Bay and had to overwinter there.[8] On 21 October 1817, Eddystone, Davis, master, came upon the waterlogged and abandoned Rover, of Newcastle, at 59°30?N 17°30?E? / ?59.500°N 17.500°E? / 59.500; 17.500. Eddystone could not approach because of the state of the sea. Eddystone was carrying a cargo of timber and furs.[9] Hudson's Bay Flag Year Master Owner Trade Source & notes 1820 Bell Hudson's Bay Company London–Hudson's Bay LR 1824 Bell J.Dale Hudson's Bay Company London–Hudson's Bay LR 1825 J.Dale T.Benson Dartmouth LR; small repairs 1824 1830 H.Harrison T.Benson Cowes–Southampton LR; small repairs 1825 and 1827 1835 J.Kearsley T.Benson "Stk."

It appeared her bottom might have been broken and she had to discharge and effect repairs.[10] Fate[edit] Eddystone was wrecked on 19 May 1843. She was driven ashore and wrecked at Point May, Newfoundland. Her crew were rescued. She was on a voyage from Liverpool, Lancashire to Quebec City.[11] Her entry in Lloyd's Register for 1843 carried the annotation "LOST".[12] Notees, citations, and references[edit] Notes ^ Log books exist for Eddystone for the period 1807 to 1823.[7] Citations ^ a b LR (1802), Supple.pages "E", Seq.?E103. ^ a b c d "Letter of Marque, p.60 - accessed 25 July 2017" (PDF).
