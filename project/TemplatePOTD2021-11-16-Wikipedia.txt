Cubs are highly vulnerable to predators during the first few weeks of life, and predation is the leading cause of mortality among cheetah cubs. A study showed that in areas with a low density of predators (such as Namibian farmlands) around 70 per cent of the cubs survived beyond the age of 14 months, whereas in areas like the Serengeti National Park, where several large carnivores exist, the survival rate was just 17 per cent. This cheetah cub was photographed in the Phinda Private Game Reserve in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, amid long grass.Photograph credit: Charles James Sharp Archive – More featured pictures...
