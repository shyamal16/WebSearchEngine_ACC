SpaceX Crew-3 was the third operational flight of a Crew Dragon spacecraft, and the fourth overall crewed orbital flight of the Commercial Crew Program. The mission successfully launched on 11 November 2021 at 02:03:31 UTC to the International Space Station.[3] Contents 1 Name 2 Crew 3 Mission 4 See also 5 References Name[edit] Crew Dragon capsules have been given names by their initial crews — Endeavour for the first, and Resilience for the second. On 7 October 2021, it was announced that the third capsule will be called Endurance.[4] The name honors the SpaceX and NASA teams that endured through a pandemic, building the spacecraft and training the astronauts who flew it.[5] The name also honors Endurance, the ship used by Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. The three-masted vessel sank in 1915 after being bound in ice before reaching Antarctica.[6] Crew[edit] German ESA astronaut Matthias Maurer was selected first for the mission in September 2020.[7][8][9] NASA astronauts Raja Chari and Thomas Marshburn were added on 14 December 2020 to the crew.[10][11] The fourth seat was left open in anticipation that a Russian cosmonaut would take the seat, marking the beginning of a barter agreement that would see NASA and Roscosmos trade seats on the Soyuz and Commercial Crew Vehicles, although in April 2021 then-acting NASA administration Steve Jurczyk said that this agreement would be unlikely to start until after Crew-3 had launched.[12] The fourth seat was assigned to Kayla Barron in May 2021.[13] Chari is the first rookie astronaut to command a NASA space mission since the Skylab 4 crew blasted off to the Skylab space station in 1973. Gerald Carr, who had not flown in space before, led a three-man crew on an 84-day flight on the Skylab.[14] This is also the first spaceflight for Maurer and Barron.[15] Prime crew Position Astronaut Spacecraft commander Raja Chari, NASA Expedition 66 / 67 First spaceflight Pilot Thomas Marshburn, NASA Expedition 66 / 67 Third spaceflight Mission specialist 1 [16] Matthias Maurer, ESA Expedition 66 / 67 First spaceflight Mission specialist 2 [16] Kayla Barron, NASA Expedition 66 / 67 First spaceflight References:[16][17][8][10][11][13] Backup crew Position Astronaut Spacecraft commander Kjell N.

The third SpaceX operational mission in the Commercial Crew Program was originally scheduled to launch on 31 October 2021.[24] However, it was delayed to 3 November 2021 due to unfavorable weather in the Atlantic Ocean,[25] and then further delayed to 7 November 2021 due to a minor medical issue with one of the astronauts.[26] Due to expected bad weather, it was again delayed to 9 November 2021.[27] Due to the launch delays, NASA decided to return the astronauts from Crew-2 before Crew-3 launched, thus being the first Crew Dragon indirect handover of space station crews.[28] SpaceX Crew-2 departed the station on 8 November 2021 and splashed down on 9 November 2021.

SpaceX Crew-3 is the third operational flight of a Crew Dragon spacecraft, and the fourth overall crewed orbital flight of the Commercial Crew Program. The mission successfully launched on 11 November 2021 at 02:03:31 UTC to the International Space Station.[3] Contents 1 Name 2 Crew 3 Mission 4 See also 5 References Name[edit] Crew Dragon capsules have been given names by their initial crews — Endeavour for the first, and Resilience for the second. On 7 October 2021, it was announced that the third capsule will be called Endurance.[4] The name honors the SpaceX and NASA teams that endured through a pandemic, building the spacecraft and training the astronauts who flew it.[5] The name also honors Endurance, the ship used by Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. The three-masted vessel sank in 1915 after being bound in ice before reaching Antarctica.[6] Crew[edit] German ESA astronaut Matthias Maurer was selected first for the mission in September 2020.[7][8][9] NASA astronauts Raja Chari and Thomas Marshburn were added on 14 December 2020 to the crew.[10][11] The fourth seat was left open in anticipation that a Russian cosmonaut would take the seat, marking the beginning of a barter agreement that would see NASA and Roscosmos trade seats on the Soyuz and Commercial Crew Vehicles, although in April 2021 then-acting NASA administration Steve Jurczyk said that this agreement would be unlikely to start until after Crew-3 had launched.[12] The fourth seat was assigned to Kayla Barron in May 2021.[13] Chari is the first rookie astronaut to command a NASA space mission since the Skylab 4 crew in 1973.[14] This is also the first spaceflight for Maurer and Barron.[15] Prime crew Position Astronaut Spacecraft commander Raja Chari, NASA Expedition 66 / 67 First spaceflight Pilot Thomas Marshburn, NASA Expedition 66 / 67 Third spaceflight Mission specialist 1 [16] Matthias Maurer, ESA Expedition 66 / 67 First spaceflight Mission specialist 2 [16] Kayla Barron, NASA Expedition 66 / 67 First spaceflight References:[16][17][8][10][11][13] Backup crew Position Astronaut Spacecraft commander Kjell N. Lindgren, NASA Pilot Robert Hines, NASA Mission specialist 1 Samantha Cristoforetti, ESA Mission specialist 2 Stephanie Wilson, NASA References:[18][19][20] The first astronauts of this NASA Astronaut Group 22 (nicknamed The Turtles) to fly to space, Raja Chari and Kayla Barron on SpaceX Crew-3 took a stuffed turtle as zero-g indicator, to pay a tribute to their astronaut group.[21] Additionally, to include the other crew members on board, Matthias Maurer and Tom Marshburn, the turtle was named "Pfau", a German word meaning "Peacock" for Matthias Maurer who is German, and for Tom Marshburn who was part of NASA Astronaut Group 19 (nicknamed The Peacocks).[22] This launch brought the total number of humans who have been to space to more than 600 with Maurer (600) and Barron (601).[23][dubious – discuss] Mission[edit] NASA's SpaceX Crew-3 astronauts participate in a countdown dress rehearsal at Kennedy Space Center in Florida on 28 October 2021, to prepare for the Crew-3 launch on 11 November 2021. The third SpaceX operational mission in the Commercial Crew Program was originally scheduled to launch on 31 October 2021.[24] However, it was delayed to 3 November 2021 due to unfavorable weather in the Atlantic Ocean,[25] and then further delayed to 7 November 2021 due to a minor medical issue with one of the astronauts.[26] Due to expected bad weather, it was again delayed to 9 November 2021.[27] Due to the launch delays, NASA decided to return the astronauts from Crew-2 before Crew-3 launched, thus being the first Crew Dragon indirect handover of space station crews.[28] SpaceX Crew-2 departed the station on 8 November 2021 and splashed down on 9 November 2021. SpaceX Crew-3 mission launched from Cape Canaveral on 11 November 2021 at 02:03:31 UTC.[29] The European segment of the mission is called "Cosmic Kiss".[30] See also[edit] Dragon C206 Endeavour Dragon C207 Resilience References[edit] ^ "Dragon Endurance".

SpaceX Crew-3 is the third operational flight of a Crew Dragon spacecraft, and the fourth overall crewed orbital flight of the Commercial Crew Program. The mission successfully launched on 11 November 2021 at 02:03:31 UTC to the International Space Station.[3] This launch brought the total number of humans who have been to space to more than 600 with Maurer (600) and Barron (601).[4] Contents 1 Name 2 Crew 3 Mission 4 See also 5 References Name[edit] Crew Dragon capsules have been given names by their initial crews — Endeavour for the first, and Resilience for the second. On 7 October 2021, it was announced that the third capsule will be called Endurance.[5] The name honors the SpaceX and NASA teams that endured through a pandemic, building the spacecraft and training the astronauts who flew it.[6] The name also honors Endurance, the ship used by Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. The three-masted vessel sank in 1915 after being bound in ice before reaching Antarctica.[7] Crew[edit] German ESA astronaut Matthias Maurer was selected first for the mission in September 2020.[8][9][10] NASA astronauts Raja Chari and Thomas Marshburn were added on 14 December 2020 to the crew.[11][12] The fourth seat was left open in anticipation that a Russian cosmonaut would take the seat, marking the beginning of a barter agreement that would see NASA and Roscosmos trade seats on the Soyuz and Commercial Crew Vehicles, although in April 2021 then-acting NASA administration Steve Jurczyk said that this agreement would be unlikely to start until after Crew-3 had launched.[13] The fourth seat was assigned to Kayla Barron in May 2021.[14] Chari is the first rookie astronaut to command a NASA space mission since the Skylab 4 crew blasted off to the Skylab space station in 1973. Gerald Carr, who had not flown in space before, led a three-man crew on an 84-day flight on the Skylab.[15] This is also the first spaceflight for Maurer and Barron.[16] Prime crew Position Astronaut Spacecraft commander Raja Chari, NASA Expedition 66 / 67 First spaceflight Pilot Thomas Marshburn, NASA Expedition 66 / 67 Third spaceflight Mission specialist 1 [17] Matthias Maurer, ESA Expedition 66 / 67 First spaceflight Mission specialist 2 [17] Kayla Barron, NASA Expedition 66 / 67 First spaceflight References:[17][18][9][11][12][14] Backup crew Position Astronaut Spacecraft commander Kjell N. Lindgren, NASA Pilot Robert Hines, NASA Mission specialist 1 Samantha Cristoforetti, ESA Mission specialist 2 Stephanie Wilson, NASA References:[19][20][21] The first astronauts of this NASA Astronaut Group 22 (nicknamed The Turtles) to fly to space, Raja Chari and Kayla Barron on SpaceX Crew-3 took a stuffed turtle as zero-g indicator, to pay a tribute to their astronaut group.[22] Additionally, to include the other crew members on board, Matthias Maurer and Tom Marshburn, the turtle was named "Pfau", a German word meaning "Peacock" for Matthias Maurer who is German, and for Tom Marshburn who was part of NASA Astronaut Group 19 (nicknamed The Peacocks).[23] Mission[edit] NASA's SpaceX Crew-3 astronauts participate in a countdown dress rehearsal at Kennedy Space Center in Florida on 28 October 2021, to prepare for the Crew-3 launch on 11 November 2021. The third SpaceX operational mission in the Commercial Crew Program was originally scheduled to launch on 31 October 2021.[24] However, it was delayed to 3 November 2021 due to unfavorable weather in the Atlantic Ocean,[25] and then further delayed to 7 November 2021 due to a minor medical issue with one of the astronauts.[26] Due to expected bad weather, it was again delayed to 9 November 2021.[27] Due to the launch delays, NASA decided to return the astronauts from Crew-2 before Crew-3 launched, thus being the first Crew Dragon indirect handover of space station crews.[28] SpaceX Crew-2 departed the station on 8 November 2021 and splashed down on 9 November 2021. SpaceX Crew-3 mission launched from Cape Canaveral on 11 November 2021 at 02:03:31 UTC.[29] The European segment of the mission is called "Cosmic Kiss".[30] See also[edit] Dragon C206 Endeavour Dragon C207 Resilience References[edit] ^ "Dragon Endurance".
