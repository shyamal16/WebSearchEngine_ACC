Date November 9, 1863 (1863-11-09) Location Imperial Academy of Arts, Saint Petersburg, Russian Empire Organised by Ivan Kramskoi Participants Bogdan Wenig, Firs Zhuravlev, Alexander Morozov, Kirill Lemokh, Ivan Kramskoi, Alexander Litovchenko, Konstantin Makovsky, Nikolai Dmitriev, Nikolai Petrov, Vasily Kreitan, Mikhail Peskov, Nikolay Shustov, Alexei Korzukhin, Alexander Grigoriev The Revolt of the Fourteen (Russian: ???? ????????????, romanized: Bunt chetyrnadtsati) was the refusal of 14 top students in the Imperial Academy of Arts of the Russian Empire to participate in a competition held on the 100th anniversary of the Academy on 9 November 1863. Led by the Russian realist painter Ivan Kramskoi, it was a response to the academy's refusal to give the competitors a free choice of art subject in the competition. The subsequent withdrawal of artists from the academy was the first demonstration of realist artists against the classical style that was popular in 19th-century Russia and is sometimes cited as the source of realism in Russian art. Contents 1 Background 2 Initial protests 3 Revolt 4 Result 5 References 6 Further reading Background[edit] Grand Gold Medal of the Academy A number of Academy graduate students who completed the full course of study were allowed to compete for the Grand Gold Medal, an honour that carried a six-year fellowship to work abroad in Italy or France. Contestants had to create their compositions on a given topic, usually one the Academic Council had gleaned from classical antiquity and the mythological repertoire.[1][2] When the theme of the competition was announced, the contestants had to stay in isolated workshops for a full day, where they had to come up with a plot and draw a sketch of a future picture in 24 hours. The sketch was approved by the Academy Council and was not subject to change.[3] The Academy had been criticised for its use of "antiquated" subjects for years, so in 1863 it announced that contestants would be given more general themes such as joy, anger, and longing instead of explicit subjects, to give each student a better opportunity to demonstrate their abilities and inclinations. The rendering specifics were left to the contestant. In other words, the Academy opened up the subject matter for the historical painters. The genre painters had always had more or less free reign. This announcement, however, came with less pleasant news: "Contestants will be allowed to participate only once, and for all the contestants there will be only one golden medal of the first class". To further complicate matters, an unusually large number of graduate students qualified for the contest that year. As a result, while in previous years fewer contestants competed for more medals (and could compete again the next year if unsuccessful), in 1863 the competition promised to be very tough, the chances for success were slimmer, and failure would be final.[1][4] Initial protests[edit] Ivan Kramskoi. 1860s The competitors decided that the new rules put genre and historical painters in an unequal position, so one of the competitors, Ivan Kramskoi organized a collective letter to the Academic Council on 8 October 1863, asking them to give the participants a free choice of subject if the theme set by the Council did not correspond to the personal inclinations of the artist.[5] The letter also questioned the advisability of isolating the participants for 24 hours to work on a sketch of the future painting.[6] Their letter was rejected two days later on 10 October.[1] After the rejection, they sent a more detailed letter to the president of the Academy, Prince Grigory Gagarin, which was left unanswered.[6] In their third attempt, the competitors wrote a letter to the chairman of the Council, Rector F. Bruni and also went to the homes of at least four professors to ask each of them personally to change the rules. As a result, the Council decided not to implement broad themes, and instead reverted to the usual practice of assigning specific topics.[1] Revolt[edit] Offended by the lack of response to their petitions, the students decided that if their request was not satisfied, they would refuse to participate in the competition and each of them would apply for graduation from the Academy on the night before the competition. At 10 am on 9 November 1863, all fifteen participants of the competition were summoned to the conference hall of the Academy, where Gagarin announced the plot for the upcoming competition to be "The Feast in Valhalla" with the focus to be on the posthumous bliss of the fallen heroes from the Nordic sagas.[2] After the announcement, Ivan Kramskoi delivered a short speech in the hall declaring his refusal to participate in the competition and also criticising the Academy for not responding to their petitions and fulfilling their request. Following the speech, students started to leave the conference hall one by one. Out of the fifteen participants, fourteen left.[4] On their way out, each student left a letter, prepared in advance, announcing that he would not take part in the contest and asking to be granted a diploma as a ranked artist (something to which each student was entitled regardless of his success or failure in the contest).[1][7] The one remaining participant was the historical artist Pyotr Zabolotsky, who announced his intention to participate in the competition. The Academy Council told Zabolotsky that the competition could not take place with just one person.[8] Result[edit] Main articles: Artel of Artists and Peredvizhniki Group photo of Artel, 1863. The thwarted competition was reported to Emperor Alexander II, who ordered police supervision to be established on the former participants.[6][9] The artists went on to establish the Artel of Artists in 1863, where they could sell their own work independently. Despite its economic success, the group disbanded eight years later and some of its members joined a new group called the Society for Travelling Art Exhibitions (Peredvizhniki).[2] Seven of the fourteen members of the revolt, including Ivan Kramskoi, later received the honorary title of "Academician", while three received the title of "Professor" of the Imperial Academy of Arts.[6] One of the participants of the revolt, Kirill Lemokh, became a teacher of arts for the children of Emperor Alexander III.[10] This is an indication that the artists were not against the Academy of Arts in principle. They belonged to the Academy in many respects; they just wanted to be free to show and sell their work independently. The Academy provided the Peredvizhniki with exhibition space for the next several years.[1] The event became the first demonstration of realist artists against the classical style that was popular in 19th-century Russia.[1][11] Historians such as John Ellis Bowlt and Tamara Talbot Rice cite the revolt as the source of realism in Russian art.[12] References[edit] ^ a b c d e f g Steiner, Evgeny (April 2011).
