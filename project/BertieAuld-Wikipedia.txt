Roma.[10] With the Midlands club he won a League Cup medal in 1963, as Birmingham beat city rivals Aston Villa 3-1 on aggregate.[5][11][12] In 1965 Auld returned to Celtic in a £12,000 deal,[5] possibly on the initiative of Jock Stein, who had not yet been appointed Celtic manager.[9] No longer considered a winger, Auld formed a midfield partnership with Bobby Murdoch.[13] He became an integral part of the side that won nine League titles, as well as the 1967 European Cup Final. Prior to that match, against Italian club Internazionale, Auld instigated a rendition of "The Celtic Song" in the tunnel, much to the bemusement of the Inter players.[14] Auld left Celtic again in 1971, this time joining Hibernian on a free transfer.[15] While at Easter Road he combined his playing role with one as a trainer, eventually focusing solely on the latter role.[16] International career[edit] Auld made three appearances for Scotland, all in 1959.[6] He made his debut against the Netherlands, a game in which he became the first player ever to be sent off for Scotland, after lashing out in retaliation at an opponent.[6] Managerial career[edit] Auld started a career as a manager in 1974, when appointed by Partick Thistle, where he stayed for six seasons. He returned to Edinburgh as Hibs manager in 1980,[5] in an attempt to revive the club following their relegation in the 1979–80 season. Auld guided Hibs to promotion by winning the 1980–81 Scottish First Division, but was replaced by Pat Stanton in 1982.[17] He then spent a year in charge of Hamilton Academical before returning to manage Thistle for a brief second spell in 1986. His final appointment was with Dumbarton in 1988.[5] Personal life[edit] From 1963 until his death, Auld was married to Liz, with whom he had two children.[7] Following the end of his football career, he ran a pub named The Buccaneer in Hamilton.[7] In the early 21st century Auld was a regular guest on Celtic TV.[9] During the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, Auld stated his support for the Better Together campaign against Scottish independence.[18] Auld died on 14 November 2021, aged 83.[6] Honours[edit] In November 2009 Auld was inducted into the Scottish Football Hall of Fame.[13] Player[edit] Celtic[19][edit] European Cup: 1967[20] Runners-up 1970[21] Intercontinental Cup: runners-up 1967[22] Scottish league championship: 1965–66, 1966–67, 1967–68, 1968–69, 1969–70[23] Scottish Cup: 1964–65[24], 1966–67[25], 1968–69[26] Scottish League Cup: 1966–67, 1967–68, 1968–69, 1969–70[23] Glasgow Cup: 1964–65, 1966–67[27] Birmingham City[edit] Inter-Cities Fairs Cup: runners-up 1960–61[10] Football League Cup: 1962–63[28] Manager[edit] Partick Thistle[edit] Scottish First Division: 1975–76[29] Hibernian[edit] Scottish First Division: 1980–81[30] References[edit] ^ "Bertie Auld".

He was a member of Celtic's Lisbon Lions, who won the 1967 European Cup Final. As a player, he made more than 200 appearances in the Scottish League for Celtic, Dumbarton and Hibernian, and more than 100 in the Football League in England with Birmingham City.[4] He also earned three caps for Scotland early in his career. He spent six years as manager at Partick Thistle, and was appointed to the club's hall of fame. He also managed Hibernian, Hamilton Academical and Dumbarton.

Roma.[11] With the Midlands club he won a League Cup medal in 1963, as Birmingham beat city rivals Aston Villa 3-1 on aggregate.[5][12][13] In 1965 Auld returned to Celtic in a £12,000 deal,[5] possibly on the initiative of Jock Stein, who had not yet been appointed Celtic manager.[10] No longer considered a winger, Auld formed a midfield partnership with Bobby Murdoch.[14] He became an integral part of the side that won nine League titles, as well as the 1967 European Cup Final. Prior to that match, against Italian club Internazionale, Auld instigated a rendition of "The Celtic Song" in the tunnel, much to the bemusement of the Inter players.[15] Auld left Celtic again in 1971, this time joining Hibernian on a free transfer.[16] While at Easter Road he combined his playing role with one as a trainer, eventually focusing solely on the latter role.[17] International career[edit] Auld made three appearances for Scotland, all in 1959.[6] He made his debut against the Netherlands, a game in which he became the first player ever to be sent off for Scotland, after lashing out in retaliation at an opponent.[6] Managerial career[edit] Auld started a career as a manager in 1974, when appointed by Partick Thistle, where he stayed for six seasons. He returned to Edinburgh as Hibs manager in 1980,[5] in an attempt to revive the club following their relegation in the 1979–80 season. Auld guided Hibs to promotion by winning the 1980–81 Scottish First Division, but was replaced by Pat Stanton in 1982.[18] He then spent a year in charge of Hamilton Academical before returning to manage Thistle for a brief second spell in 1986. His final appointment was with Dumbarton in 1988.[5] Personal life[edit] From 1963 until his death, Auld was married to Liz, with whom he had two children.[7] Following the end of his football career, he ran a pub named The Buccaneer in Hamilton.[7] In the early 21st century Auld was a regular guest on Celtic TV.[10] During the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, Auld stated his support for the Better Together campaign against Scottish independence.[19] Auld died on 14 November 2021, aged 83.[6] Honours[edit] In November 2009 Auld was inducted into the Scottish Football Hall of Fame.[14] Player[edit] Celtic[8][edit] European Cup: 1967[20] Runners-up 1970[21] Intercontinental Cup: runners-up 1967[22] Scottish league championship: 1965–66, 1966–67, 1967–68, 1968–69, 1969–70[23] Scottish Cup: 1964–65[24], 1966–67[25], 1968–69[26] Scottish League Cup: 1966–67, 1967–68, 1968–69, 1969–70[23] Glasgow Cup: 1964–65, 1966–67[27] Birmingham City[edit] Inter-Cities Fairs Cup: runners-up 1960–61[11] Football League Cup: 1962–63[28] Manager[edit] Partick Thistle[edit] Scottish First Division: 1975–76[29] Hibernian[edit] Scottish First Division: 1980–81[30] References[edit] ^ "Bertie Auld".

He was a member of Celtic's Lisbon Lions, who won the 1967 European Cup Final. As a player, he made more than 200 appearances in the Scottish League for Celtic, Dumbarton and Hibernian, and more than 100 in the Football League in England with Birmingham City.[4] He also earned three caps for Scotland early in his career. He spent six years as manager at Partick Thistle, and was appointed to the club's hall of fame. He also managed Hibernian, Hamilton Academical and Dumbarton.

Roma.[11] With the Midlands club he won a League Cup medal in 1963, as Birmingham beat city rivals Aston Villa 3-1 on aggregate.[5][12][13] In 1965 Auld returned to Celtic in a £12,000 deal,[5] possibly on the initiative of Jock Stein, who had not yet been appointed Celtic manager.[10] No longer considered a winger, Auld formed a midfield partnership with Bobby Murdoch.[14] He became an integral part of the side that won nine League titles, as well as the 1967 European Cup Final. Prior to that match, against Italian club Internazionale, Auld instigated a rendition of "The Celtic Song" in the tunnel, much to the bemusement of the Inter players.[15] Auld left Celtic again in 1971, this time joining Hibernian on a free transfer.[16] While at Easter Road he combined his playing role with one as a trainer, eventually focusing solely on the latter role.[17] International career[edit] Auld made three appearances for Scotland, all in 1959.[6] He made his debut against the Netherlands, a game in which he became the first player ever to be sent off for Scotland, after lashing out in retaliation at an opponent.[6] Managerial career[edit] Auld started a career as a manager in 1974, when appointed by Partick Thistle, where he stayed for six seasons. He returned to Edinburgh as Hibs manager in 1980,[5] in an attempt to revive the club following their relegation in the 1979–80 season. Auld guided Hibs to promotion by winning the 1980–81 Scottish First Division, but was replaced by Pat Stanton in 1982.[18] He then spent a year in charge of Hamilton Academical before returning to manage Thistle for a brief second spell in 1986. His final appointment was with Dumbarton in 1988.[5] Personal life[edit] From 1963 until his death, Auld was married to Liz, with whom he had two children.[7] Following the end of his football career, he ran a pub named The Buccaneer in Hamilton.[7] In the early 21st century Auld was a regular guest on Celtic TV.[10] During the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, Auld stated his support for the Better Together campaign against Scottish independence.[19] Auld died on 14 November 2021, aged 83.[6] Honours[edit] In November 2009 Auld was inducted into the Scottish Football Hall of Fame.[14] Player[edit] Celtic[8][edit] European Cup: 1967[20] Runners-up 1970[21] Intercontinental Cup: runners-up 1967[22] Scottish league championship: 1965–66, 1966–67, 1967–68, 1968–69, 1969–70[23] Scottish Cup: 1964–65[24], 1966–67[25], 1968–69[26] Scottish League Cup: 1966–67, 1967–68, 1968–69, 1969–70[23] Glasgow Cup: 1964–65, 1966–67[27] Birmingham City[edit] Inter-Cities Fairs Cup: runners-up 1960–61[11] Football League Cup: 1962–63[28] Manager[edit] Partick Thistle[edit] Scottish First Division: 1975–76[29] Hibernian[edit] Scottish First Division: 1980–81[30] References[edit] ^ "Bertie Auld".
