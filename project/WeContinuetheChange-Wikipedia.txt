It competed in the November 2021 Bulgarian National Assembly ?lection.[3] Since the coalition was created too late to have its own registration, it has to compete in the elections with the registration of one or more of its member parties. This has been done through Volt Bulgaria and Middle European Class,[4] with the former being a party that recently left the parliamentary coalition IBG-NI. Contents 1 History 2 Ideology and platform 3 Structure 3.1 Composition 4 Election results 4.1 Election results 5 References History[edit] The party was officially launched on 19 September 2021, after a month-long speculation about its creation.[5] It was created to be an alternative anti-corruption party that could be seen as a "uniting force" between the other parties.[6] The party favours working with the anti-establishment parties, but it has said there is speculation that it will work with BSP for Bulgaria to form a coalition. It has also not ruled out the possibility of working with GERB-SDS or Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS), but Kiril Petkov has said that DPS must break contact and drop support of ex-MP Delyan Peevski, and GERB must support the replacement of Chief Prosecutor Ivan Geshev, in order to be considered as potential coalition partners. A new movement, the party announced that it would not create a pre-electoral agreement with the other anti-establishment parties, but there will be a signed agreement of cooperation following the November election.[7][8][9] Ideology and platform[edit] Economically, the main goals of the coalition are to create a favourable economic and administrative environment for the free development of small and medium-sized businesses and to attract strategic high-tech investments. On a more political level, they seek to stop corruption and misuse of state funds as well as uphold the rule of law.[10] Priority for government formation is the access to quality education and healthcare for all Bulgarian citizens, modern infrastructure. They also stress social policy, in particular improving pensions for retired people.[11] For the 2021 presidential election, Petkov and Vasilev declared their support for the incumbent President Rumen Radev.[12] For the 2021 parliamentary elections, the coalition is campaigning on a vague platform to attract voters of different persuasions, with particular emphasis on the corruption of the former government of Boiko Borissov. Kiril Petkov and Asen Vasilev, both businessmen, are seen as pro-business and advocate anchoring Bulgaria in the European Union and NATO.[13] Structure[edit] The coalition has two leaders, Kiril Petkov and Asen Vasilev. The main party of the coalition is "We continue the change". There are three smaller "mandate carrier" parties, the Political Movement "Social Democrats" (PDS), Volt Bulgaria and Middle European Class (SEC),[14] which have surrendered their party lists up to the coalition to be used at election.
